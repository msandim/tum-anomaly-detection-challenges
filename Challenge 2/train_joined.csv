You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower.  So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities.  You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.   It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time.  But this is a small quibble.  Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet.  But we did notice a café in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent.  There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel.  Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.   In short, no real complaints.  The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!",4,2,0,1,N,y5ptsWmvGEAftOQaiFhBcg,Stella BraveTart J.,"Lexington-Fayette, KY",September 2009,49,104,36,282,83,92,43,0,21,0.09236234458259325,2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg,Inn At Lincoln Park,"Inn At Lincoln Park - Lincoln Park - Chicago, IL",20,2.0,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","601 W Diversey Pkwy (between Broadway St & Cambridge Ave) Chicago, IL 60614 Neighborhood: Lincoln Park",Yes,$$$,Free,None,(773) 348-2810,5

The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart.

We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep.

Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan.  While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying.  Just get a new, quieter fan.  I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses.  The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress.  The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height.

We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving.  (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?)  I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL.  Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for.  My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing.  Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it.  She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day.  Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall).  We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour.  (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain!  102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000.  Try doing that in downtown Chicago.  (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given.  The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar).  A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).",5,1,0,1,N,vhDOO4-w17ZGhg7JzEo8OA,Katherine C.,"New York, NY",January 2010,0,11,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0.010956175298804782,7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA,Holiday Inn,"Holiday Inn - Near North Side - Chicago, IL",86,3.5,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces","350 W Mart Ctr Dr Chicago, IL 60654 Neighborhoods: Near North Side, River North",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.holidayinn.com,(312) 836-5000,14

Very nice front desk staff during morning and late evening hours.

Property also clean, well maintained and fresh smelling. Sure, rooms are small but why would you stay in your room in this great city. I didn't find them terribly small. There was a small hallway that went past the bathroom to an area with a desk, queen bed and flat screen. Modern decor and colors. Small dresser in closet with ironing board and safe. Bathroom larger than I expected after reading the other reviews. FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had yogurt, cereal, hot cinnamon rolls, an egg product, sausage, etc. Hot beverages were always available throughout the day. Clean dining area just off lobby. Clean, comfortable beds, updated fixtures, comfy bed, clean, bright linens. I did not have too many issues with noise overall. Good water pressure, hot water, clean towels.

These employees I encountered had wonderful customer service and personality ! Always a plus! I didn't feel like I was staying in a chain hotel when I checked in. They gave me all info I needed at check in. Some hotels i have to call the front desk when I get to my room because they didn't give me the wireless internet access. I booked a 2double bed room.. Rooms are on the small side, but that is because the building was built in the 1930s hence the small rooms compared to other hotels. Loved my room.  Bed was comfortable and warm in the Chicago winter. The window does have a bit of a cold draft, but with the heater on 75 at night and under the blankets I was super warm. Bathrooms. The cleanest bathroom I felt comfortable putting my bare tush on the toilet, and my bare feet in the tub. The shower tub had a mat on the tub floor which means they can remove it and sanitize for the next person ! I love how cute and chic the whole hotel felt. I will definitely stay here again, I'm looking forward to it. Con Jus checked out. Valet parking took forever to bring the car around ! We called before we left the room, checked out, and waited. And waited like fifteen minutes. It took valet a total of half hour to bring the car around. Valet ls $40. Self park at the same garage for overnight is $39. Next time id rather save a dollar +tip and park my own Damn car. Valet was not economically savvy after waiting forever to get my car it was not rush hour. The time I waited I could have gotten my own car and loaded up my luggage and been on my way to my flight !! The valet guy was not even apologetic for taking Soo long.

There was a random beark skin blanket on the bed? Not sure why since it didn't match the victorian decor at all.  The bed was comfy and the pillows.  Which is always a plus except when you can't get a good nights sleep because you're woken so much thru the night. The room wasn't huge, standard size room, but had a nice full length mirror on the closet doors.  Lighting wasn't the best, I can't imagine the two other lamps would have shed much more light.  The bathroom was fairly lit and decent in size.

60,9/13/2011,7fv58g8UKSuFnDXj4lyCxQ,"I named my own price on Priceline and the Whitehall Hotel was selected. We arrived at Whitehall around midnight for s 5-day stay in Chicago. The hotel is located in the Gold Coast area of downtown Chicago and is only one block from the shopping along Magnificent Mile and Michigan Ave. The doorman took our bags and led us to the counter for check-in. The lady at the counter was friendly and explained the basics of the hotel, such as room service, on-site restaurants, and the business center. Up to the room we went. She then mentioned that we were upgraded to a junior suite...score! Entering the room on the 10th floor, the older decor was an instant eye-catcher, which is a good thing. A few of the artsy fixtures looked like something from medieval times and the bed frame was also old-fashioned (I added a few photos of our room). There is a small bench at the end of the bed which is good for watching TV or looking out of the window. The mattress on the bed was AWESOME, as it was very firm and conformed to my body. Six pillows lined the headboard, all of a somewhat different level of cushion. Closet space is standard, with a set of hangers, an ironing board, and a safe. Lighting was low, even with a ceiling light and five lamps spread throughout the room. I believe they need to add one more adjustable bright lamp, because the darkness is bad on the eyes when watching TV or using the computer. The bathroom was nice! Good power in the shower water, clean and fresh smelling, nice toiletries, and the hand soap was the same clam shell shape as the soap dish. Nice touch! A complimentary newspaper is left at the room door every morning and the soundproofing between rooms is solid. The housekeepers are friendly and if they see you in the halls, they ask if you need your room tended to...little things like this make hotels stand out. Lobby doors are opened for you when you come and go, and catching cab is a breeze as the cabs line up to the left of the building. The hotel is also close to State Street and is within walking distance to many areas around downtown. The hotel provides a number of maps and pamphlets to help you plan you daily activities.

We'd checked out a BUNCH of hotels on Expedia and Yelped a bunch as well, and we settled at the Whitehall. We also got a great deal on our hotel + flight combo through Expedia, and we're glad we booked here. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location in Chicago. It's in the downtown area, and MINUTES away from any and all transportation you'd need to get where you've gotta be. It's a block away from the major buses you'd need, and only 3 blocks away from the L line. The decor of the place is nice -- it's a good mix of old-fashioned ideas with a modern touch. The people who work the desks are extremely helpful, and knew we were out of towners -- gave us some recommendations immediately for places to eat and even drew out how to get there...always a plus. The room itself: completely and absolutely perfect for what we needed it for. We weren't here to soak in bed all day, we were gonna be out exploring what Chicago had to offer. So the Whitehall delivered -- a BEAUTIFUL room (HUGE bed), with a nice bathroom and desk to plan things out. It was cleaned the same time each day, and the staff left it looking terrific. If we ordered anything to the room (such as towels, extra toothpaste, etc), they brought it up within 2-3 minutes, which is also a plus. The negatives: the real estate isn't great. Rooms are a bit on the smaller size, but again, it had everything we wanted and it had it done well. The other odd thing was the curtains...they weren't able to be closed. They were in a fixed open position, but luckily, there was a FIRST LAYER of blind to close the window off but allow SOME light in. Just an odd sort of characteristic.

If you're looking for a shiny modern-contemporary boutique hotel experience, this isn't it.  Whitehall has a more comfortable, traditional vibe that wouldn't be hurt by a little updating -- perhaps an interior paint job, some more modern lighting.  But don't be put off by the lobby area (rather dark and fusty) as the rooms are much nicer. The staff I dealt with was friendly and helpful (walking maps, suggestions, taxi-hailing).  Although I'd reserved a king they offered to switch me to a larger corner room with two queens so I could enjoy a view.  Glad I agreed, for two reasons:  1) the view;  2)  with two beds in the room it meant I could do one of my favorite things to do when traveling & staying alone in a hotel - build a big downy bed-cocoon in one bed using the pillows and comforter from the second.   And honestly....The beds.  ROCKED.  Their matresses have some sort of brand name like 'Hypnose' or 'Hypnotic' or something like that, and they were.  The pillows were perfect, the comforter was light and downy, and the high-thread count sheets slid against my skin like, well, high-thread count sheets.  I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings on the first night, but I did here -- thanks to my high-thread count bed cocoon and the perfectly quiet environment (I was on the 15th floor, which might account for the silence). The bathroom was dandy, the complimentary robes delightful, and the view charming.  After getting back around 10:30 or so from my biz-event on Friday night I did find myself wishing they had 24-7 room service of some sort.  I was hungry and tired but had to wander down to the attached restaurant, Fornetto Mei, to try and snag something to bring back to my room before the restaurant closed...and it was about to, so mine was the last order of the evening.  Ended up getting a room temp pizza that was just 'meh.' The Whitehall's location is superb, particularly if you're like me and you decide at the last minute that you don't want to wear what you brought to wear to the event you have to be at in three hours.  I just strolled across the street to the shopping plaza that houses Bloomies, Banana Republic, a freshly opened Karen Millen boutique, JCrew, etc. etc., and had a mini shopping spree.  Lots of other posh, high-end boutiques in the area too if you're staying at the Four Seasons and have the matching bank account. * Fun Factoid?  (I should probably look this up before spreading potential misinfo...too lazy)   Someone at my biz event told me the Whitehall was famous as the hotel the Rolling Stones used to stay in and, presumably, party in and otherwise generally act like the Rolling Stones in, back in the day.",3,2,1,2,N,vEY4lllUjK38-ADAbQGaMg,Dana C.,"Big Rapids, MI",August 2012,0,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.11475409836065574,h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ,Heart O' Chicago Motel,"Heart O' Chicago Motel - Edgewater - Chicago, IL",15,3.5,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","5990 N Ridge Ave Chicago, IL 60660 Neighborhood: Edgewater",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.heartochicago.com,(773) 271-9181,4

Despite my better judgment, I went to HotWire and selected a ""blind"" 4-star at $159/night in the Streeterville area, which turned out to be the Whitehall. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean hotel with friendly service and I have no doubt that 70 years ago it was one of the top hotels in the city. Unfortunately it has remained largely in its original state. The beds are comfy, the pillows are fluffy, but the place is extremely out-dated; almost as if you'd walked into a time machine. The elevators are tiny, bordering on claustrophobic, and if more than two people are attempting a ride, they will all become much better acquainted than they might have liked. The hallways are equally confining; narrow, dark, a little depressing. The rooms aren't large, there's no wireless Internet, the lamps are original fixtures with unchanged (and probably untested) circuitry-- as confirmed by a quirky switch on one in my room, that refused to turn on without some coaxing. Similarly, the bathroom telephone had a poor connection. Worst of all, my room smelled of decades of cigarette smoke. Horrible. The decor is somewhat dreary, definitely not warm. All of these are symptoms of a hotel begging to be upgraded. On the plus side, the location is great, my room was quiet, the staff was friendly, and the price was right-- although next time, I'll select the hotel myself, pay the additional premium for the privilege, and enjoy it perhaps a little more.

94,6/23/2008,ct27P83Y17bf5uSLcoGgcw,"Hotel Indigo is an upbeat hidden jewel in the sometimes stuffy Gold Coast hotel district. In the earlier half of 2006, (while most of my friends and I were still trapped in the burbs) we'd frequently look to Hotwire to find a hotel when a friend's couch was unavailable. On St Patty's Day weekend in 2006, I ended up booking a room at the Hotel Indigo for a friend, myself, and any others that should straggle back to our hotel that night. When we arrived we were taken aback by the look and feel of the lobby. It felt more like residence than a hotel. The decor seemed a little more personal as if someone had built the room piece by piece. The elevators were the old style kinds with grates and although quite sound (they weren't rickety) they slightly triggered my fear of suspension. Truthfully, it could have been that combined with one of my friends jumping up and down once he realized I wasn't a fan of elevators. Ass. The hallways are brightly painted, but not done so that it appears tacky. Again, I felt like I was visiting a large home more than a hotel. This feeling was magnified once I saw my room. Although it had the same 2 beds/mirror and sink combo/separate shower and toilet room setup as most hotels, it felt like a bedroom. I tend to prefer neutral colors in decor, but somehow all the oranges, blues, whites, purples and yellows worked together. Dare I say this, but this is just a damn cute hotel. Unlike previous reviewers I didn't get the beachy vibe as much as I felt cozy and comfy. The staff was also very friendly. We didn't take advantage of room service, but they did look the other way as a bunch of 23 year olds checked in 15 additional guests (my friends are poor planners!), 3 24 packs and a visible beer bong. They were equally as non observant when we boisterously arrived (half of us on piggyback) back at 5am. Hey - St. Patty's fell on a Friday that year. I'd definitely recommend Hotel Indigo for visiting parents (I have a feeling that most mothers will adore the setup) or a nice couples getaway if you can't particularly get away from the Chicagoland area. Hey, sometimes it's nice to shake it up. The location is walkable to many attractions and the Clark/Division (Red Line) and Division (Blue Line) stops so if you can pry yourself out of bed (that bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in) almost anything in the city is mere few footsteps away. I posted a few pictures from that weekend to show room decor.

95,12/14/2008,MZWZ5Q5xmA6aYJO8CIVSfQ,"Eh. I wasn't impressed during my recent stay at the Hotel Indigo. Oh sure- the location is great- just blocks from Old Town, and the lake. And the bed was comfortable. And the price was okay at $172 for a king room. But this place, while it calls itself a ""boutique hotel"" lacks the service and amenities of a true ""boutique hotel"". The front desk check in was a hassle, and the staff was unconcerned about the wait and as I stood there- I watched them deal with other guests in a nonchalant way that a true ""boutique hotel"" would not. Hotel Indigo looks it was decorated from Ikea with it's bright blue walls and green and white striped accents with simple wood furniture. I don't know if they were going for a beach theme but that's what it reminded me of. The room was tiny- so much so that the bed took up all the space and you bumped into the wall to get into the even tinier bathroom.  Maybe there are better rooms in the hotel so if you go- don't get room #514! But the real kicker here had to be the tiny bar in the front lobby. I went down to have a drink and the bartender told me that they didn't have much liquor. What? She then held up the vodka bottle and swished it around so I could see that there was barely a shot left in the bottom. When I asked her about it (knowing I was staying at the hotel with people who like to drink) she just shrugged and said an order must not have come in. Really? And there is no where in Chicago to buy some liquor to take care of your guests? Parking runs $36 per night at the garage next door (that's another review but the headline is- if you can find another place to park you should go there) All in all- I guess Hotel Indigo is fine for a basic hotel stay but I hate that they promote it as a ""boutique hotel"" for along with that label comes certain expectations.

108,10/7/2008,GYN,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently.  I am a business traveler that just relocated to Chicago and needed a place to stay while I was waiting to move into my apartment.  I stayed in many different hotels before moving into my place - Swiss Hotel, Marriott, Hyatt - all downtown and I have to tell you, they really depressed me.  Maybe they are geared for the business traveler and not a pleasure traveler, but God, I hated those places.  So I decided to try something different and got a boutique hotel in the Gold Coast which is how I ended up at Hotel Indigo.   Wow, what a great little place.  I looooved it.  Loved the hotel and really loved the location - tucked in on a residential Gold Coast street.  The decor is bright and you just feel happy as soon as you walk in.  The decor is mainly blues and greens - very bright and beachy - it would really be a great place to stay in the summertime.   Anyway, the people were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were big and bright and nice and the location is to die for.  You can walk to shopping in the Gold Coast, walk to the beach, walk to Old Town, you can even walk to Lincoln Park and the Zoo if the weather permits and you have comfy shoes on.  And forget all those places above - you can just walk around the neighborhood and take a look at all the gorgeous old greystones and brownstones and have a great time.   Highly recommend.  And check out Priceline and Hotwire - they have this place listed at times as the ""secret"" 3.5 star boutique hotel in Goldcoast/Water Tower area.  I got a room on Hotwire here for $109 a night (usually their rates are $275 and up).  What a steal!",4,0,0,0,N,VveQW3yKqgi8gAjwKzUVBg,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",December 2006,36,329,33,543,310,217,84,0,20,0.15438761145002347,xxelx313NbK4nDwARueZeg,Rodan,"Rodan - Wicker Park - Chicago, IL",323,3.5,"Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Nightlife, Bars, METADATA","1530 N Milwaukee Ave (between Damen Ave & North Ave) Chicago, IL 60622 Neighborhood: Wicker Park",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.rodanchicago.com,(773) 276-7036,0

I think that it must  be a midwest thing because I found that across the board with the general folk too. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly whisked up to our room. At the time we were both smokers so I had requested a smoking room but OH MY! The smell of the ciggie smoke in the hallway just gave me a good ol' one two punch in the nose! It was like a smokers convention had just left the hallway. The room on the other hand had a great themed decor of being at the beach/boardwalk. It was a great and up lifting feeling being that we stayed there in the middle of February and just in time for a big winter storm. The bed was very comfy and like Robert S. said lot of pillows which was a good thing for me cause I am the Princess of pillow hogs *evil grin*. Oh the hotel is located in the Gold Coast residential area which is an upscale area with condos and brownstones. I didn't feel unsafe at all during the entire trip coming or leaving the hotel. I'd highly requimend the hotel to woman or young ladies who are traveling on their own. I'd stay here again if the price is right.

I only discovered this tonight as I had previously been too embarrassed to ask how to turn it on (it wasn't plugged in, but there were two wires and I followed the wrong one and... it's embarrassing, I confess). I was right to not ask because the front desk man was rude and unhelpful and told me there was a switch and there wasn't. The TV sounds like it's got some doppler effect going on, but I'm sitting still. Sometimes there is no sound. SOMETIMES THERE'S LOADS.

I met them in Chicago for my Dad's birthday and wanted to be nice and pre-pay for one night of their 2-night stay. First, there were problems with billing over charging me and customer service BEFORE we even arrived for our stay. I called four times to the hotel to ask about the charges and no one ever got back to me until i had to go to the website and write a comment. I spoke with Director of Operations who really did nothing to apologize for the mistake or make any attempt to rectify the situation. When I asked for my parents to be compensated for one of their rooms for one night during their 2 night stay I was told that it was a ridiculous request and it was the equivalent of ""asking a mechanic making a car payment for you because you dinged your car"". Instead I was told he would think of some way to make it up to my parents when they checked out on Sunday (which never happened). They credited my credit card for the amount they overcharged me so I still paid for one night of the 2 night stay. When my parents checked out on Sunday, November 14th, not only were they charged for 2-nights, but for 2-nights worth of parking for 2-vehicles. My parents only had one vehicle. The Manager that was on staff spoke with my parents and told them that I was never there to sign for the charges to my card and therefore I was never paid-obviously a lie. By the time that everything got cleared up with the parking and a few other problems with the other rooms under my mother's name- the manager offered to take off the charge for one of the nights of their 2 night stay (exactly like I requested but was denied-again an unreasonable request). My father asked for a receipt and documentation which the Manager reluctantly gave him. So now for a THIRD TIME we are being overcharged. I already paid for one of the nights of their 2 night stay yet my parents paid for the same night since they were given the second night stay free. We will never be back to this hotel again it was a horrible experience even BEFORE we arrived and you had another chance to improve customer service during our stay and failed.The only genuine apology I received was from your accountant.

The bathroom had checkered tiles on the walls with cubed windows which added more character to the hotel room . The room was very clean and fully stocked.

I discussed the issue of getting a quiet room with the front desk clerk upon check out.  She informed me that though I might request a quiet room, there was no way they could guarantee one for me in advance. I emailed the hotel after having left with a summary of my concerns.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt email from the general manager apologizing for my inconveniences, offering a credit as compensation, and requesting that I call her.  I did call the GM, and she explained to me that the hotel had been working with the yogurt shop on noise issues.  Further she said she would talk with her staff as to how to better accomodate guests wanting quiet rooms.  Desired room types are not always available on the quiet side of the hotel.  In closing, she requested that I call her personally to arrange any future stays at City Suites.

We were in town because a family member had been in an accident and was hospitalized at Illinois Masonic (4 blocks away).   We found out that City Suites has a special rate for that circumstance, so if you are in that situation, be sure to ask. We feel as if we found a ""second home"" in Chicago, and while no nice hotels in the city are inexpensive, this was well within the ""reasonable"" range.   Very relaxing ambience in a hustle-bustle neighborhood  helps to make this a winner, too. Both nights we got the ""last available"" room, so book ahead.  It's not a large property.   In reading others' comments, it appears our room locations must have been advantageous regarding the noise issues.   So ask about that when you book.

152,8/8/2012,enn,"I knew when I booked this place I was not getting someplace fancy, so my review is based on that knowledge going in. I paid rather more then I would for a room like this anyplace else, but it was still the cheapest place in downtown Chicago for the night I was in town. The lobby is very pretty and well taken care of. The upstairs floors are dark and rather worn, but still fairly well cared for. The room was small but it was just me and my suitcase so I didn't care. You could hear the trains from the room, but they weren't disruptively loud. The biggest complaint I have about the room is that despite it being a non-smoking room starting about 10pm the room started to smell very strongly of stale smoke. Running the fan/AC didn't help and the windows were painted shut so there was no way to get fresh air in the room. It only got stronger as the night went along to the point where I started to get a migraine from it - needless to say did not actually get much sleep. It was a fantastic location for me to go out and wander from though, and they have a secured and guarded parking garage across the street for those that drive in. Alo free and surprisingly good internet service! Staff for the most part was friendly, except I was looked at like I was from another planet when I asked about the possibility of early check-in.

For the rate we got this room, i think it was absolute perfection compared to the rates you'll get at other hotels that are right smack in the middle of downtown Chicago.  The location is amazing.  Walking distance to EVERYTHING.  With Grant Park, Millennium Park, Warehouse Liquors, Buddy Guy's Legends, immediate public transportation access, Lou Malnati's and a 24hr Dunkin' Donuts to feed your post-club drunken debauchery right next door;  just to name a couple of things you are adjacent to this hotel.  A mere 5 minute cab ride away from  anything you want to go to in the city.   This hotel is a STEAL!   The staff were good sports.  Especially when my group strolled in around 5:30am just looking a drunken hot mess with left over Rock N Roll McDonald's bags at hand.   I'm sure everyone at front desk got a good laugh watching us make a dent in that city.   ^-^  The staff laughed at all our sarcastic jokes and there was always someone around kind enough to take us on the frate elevators when the regular ones were busy.  LOVE THEM!

I checked out the gym and it's quite small, but there are a fair number of treadmills there.  The swimming pool was also small, so don't expect to swim laps.  Overall, the facilities aren't bad and much better than nothing. The room I stayed in had 2 queen sized beds and was quite roomy.  Some small complaints that I have are that there is no safe in the room, and there is no bathroom fan. The service was wonderful!  Upon arriving, we used the parking valet and as the bellhop helped us into the lobby, I realized that I had left my wallet in the car.  The bellhop ran outside and chased down the valet, and I had my wallet back within a minute.  I don't normally use valet parking, so this was a very good experience for my first time.

Inspite of the construction on the corner of State and Grand, the exterior was still well swept, nary a noise was heard through the construction, and inside the lobby was wonderfully appointed. On the inside however, the hotel was suffering from the need for a makeover, much more than new beds could ever offer. It looked like any Marriott from the late 80's and 90's, our two queen suite even being overlooked by a Marriott hotel, likely giggling whenever we opened the windows, saying to itself ""Yeah. I remember when I looked like that. Good times."" The front desk employees weren't much help (aside from the Consierge). Despite a clearly labeled 3pm check-in time, our room wasn't ready at 3pm. In fact, it wasn't ready at 4pm when we'd returned to the hotel after a few drinks in the attached Weber Grill. The front desk employee who'd asked if she could help us rolled her eyes when I asked if our room was ready. ""Sir, we're very busy,"" she replied. ""Your room is marked as cleaned, but there's something they need to replace in housekeeping. Let me call them."" Two other people approached the desk and were told the same. I stood up after a half-hour and glared (I'm good at glaring) slightly. The girl, with a lobby full of people, disappeared for a while. The consierge, who's name I didn't catch, smiled and nodded at me. He cleared off a luggage cart and told my son (who's name he'd heard once in passing, which shames me more for not remembering his) to stand there, and he'd be right back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and came back, nudging me. ""Ask her again if your room's ready. I'll betcha it is,"" he said with a wink. I did. It was. We were on our way. As for the room? The best I can say is that it was a place to sleep. I certainly didn't feel as though I was in the lap of luxury, though for the price I paid, I certainly shouldn't, either. Still, their wannabe Sleep Number bed is for the birds. The lowest setting is just flat enough to emulate a more than worn-out mattress. The highest, firmest setting was marginally harder than concrete. The middle setting was non-existent. I didn't sleep well, but, I did sleep. Would I stay here again? Sure. If I were on a trip with family, I would absolutely stay here again. The pool was nice, if small. The attached food options and location are wonderful.

204,12/30/2010,UUoqghbG0XflzwF-2mnGvg,"I'm out of northern Ca along with a couple of other friends visiting a friend being a former Stocktonian and chosed this place based on the reviews on http://hotels.com and various other sites.. I would give this place a 4-5 star review, if they had their internet working AND that they do not have any technical restrictions using a wired/wireless router based on the MAC address of the device (mainly linksys and netgear, and tried all the tricks such as cloning the Mac address or spoofing it or forcing the router to act as a bridge), and that their staff (or this one tall clerk) was helpful and committing. Unfortunately it wasn't in this case. I'm just pissed that I brought a router for nothing as I'm finding out later that this hotels ISP have restrictions against bringing your own router and sharing the hardline with other computers, and that you can only go wired thru the hardwire connection. So we were going to connect thru the hardwire by plugging and unplugging the ridiculously hard to connect ethernet cable, then all of a sudden it went down too. But still I wanted to use the wireless linkys off the hardwire to use my iPhone 4s facetime capability to FaceTime with my family thru my dads iPhone 4 while out of state.... but didn't.. However, several other desk clerks told me the internet was through ATT, so I think they need to end their relationship with ATT and get another high speed ISP that will not go down, no matter how many tenants and what holiday. However, we can use their ""conference"" rooms internet wire connection. We'd have to have someone unlock it every now and then. OR there's the business center with 3 computers and its only those computers you can use and not plug in your own, but 1 out of 3 terminals As far as the room (double double queen), it's good enough for our stay. Had cable TV (no premium HBO or anything) and a nice small type of dining area with a loveseat and two chairs, and a small round table.. Bathroom was in good order, and had a 5th floor room with a good view. A couple of desk lamps have an outlet so you can plug in small things to charge like your phone or mp3 player. Speaking of outlets, there's probably more than enough and wasted some luggage space bringing my own power strip. An ironing board, dryer, and iron were all provided and all worked. Everything was clean, and no wrinkles or loose rolls in the rug, housekeeping does come by once in a while, though it's a Vietnamese lady so you're just going to have to point what you want or just say no thank you waving your hand shaking your head. Downstairs there's restaurants and a bar area. The bar area is fine, though we mainly went out to eat than going to the restaurants downstairs. This place is near walking distance of the CTA (red line, cermak/Chinatown). Anyhow, all I can say is don't rely on an internet connection at all if you decide to come here. Just stick with mobile web browsing on your smartphone using your 3/4g network or tether it to your laptop, use a 3/4PCI laptop card, etc. That's this hotels main concern. And we're probably not going to visit Chicago, IL for a while or never.

207,1/29/2011,Ew96MoO-twPPWtN1nlXotA,"I stayed here for a night this past December. The room was OK, fairly clean and pretty spacious. I picked this hotel because of the price (one of the 'best deals' I could find for Chicago area hotel that didn't seem like a complete dump) and the somewhat decent reviews I found on the Internet. I was on the top floor (5th) with a decent view toward the city and McCormick convention center. The neighborhood is not the nicest but I walked around at night and felt fairly safe. There aren't really any restaurants or stores within walking distance. I did walk to a Walgreens and to Chinatown at night but it was quite the walk. Better off taking a cab or hopping on the ""L"" train around there (the train runs parallel to the street right in front of the hotel). The gym/workout room was OK. The Internet in the hotel didn't work several times during my 1 night stay. Nobody had any idea as to when it might be working again. Besides a restaurant and a bar, there is also a small coffee/sandwich place in the building but it was closed several times although the hours shown on the sign said it should've been open. There is also a small store and a salon. A word of advice....stay away from the bar in the hotel! I can't comment on the restaurant across the hallway but the bar (SL Sports Bar & Lounge) is a complete joke...if this place weren't located inside of a hotel, they'd be out of business in no time. I decided to eat there at night because it seemed convenient. Although 2 bartenders, the manger AND the owner were behind the bar, not one of them bothered greeting or even acknowledging me when I walked in or even after I was sitting at the bar for several minutes and the same happend with several customers who came in after me. To order something, it felt like customers had to either beg them for attention or get angry and cause a ruckus, despite the fact that there were 4 people working behind the bar and only about 12 customers in the place. The place really wasn't that busy and by no means trendy enough to have any kind of attitude towards its customers. It was a plain, no frills hotel bar. One lady next to me got so angry about the fact that she was continuously ignored by the employees, including the manager, that she asked to speak to the owner ""Tony,"" who then actually tried to weasel his way out of having to deal with her complaint by telling her he was not the owner, despite the fact that the bartenders had already pointed him out. What a joke...have some pride (or at least the slightest bit of business sense) and try to make things right. After he finally admitted to her that he was in fact the owner, he tried to play ""Mr. Smooth"" with her, asked what the problem was but, at the end of the conversation, still made no actual attempt to rectify the situation. The chicken sandwich I had ordered to take to the room with me sat on the bar counter for close to 10 minutes until I insisted that one of the bartenders check whether that was my order and so, naturally, it was cold by the time I got to the room to eat it. I didn't think you could screw up a simple grilled chicken sandwich but this place still managed to do it. It tasted like somebody had cooked it over a week ago and the fries weren't any better. The chicken breast was partially ""rubbery,"" partially dry and partially burned on the outside.

217,10/10/2011,n8R,"I stayed at the Wheeler last September with my wife. I contacted their office to reserve a particular room that we had stayed in on a previous visit. Stephanie returned my email and confirmed my reservation. However, when I arrived, I was told the room I reserved was unavailable, and that they would substitute another room. The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool. You don't just forget that you are renovating your entire hotel. They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit. This is the worst possible service, deliberately lying to your customers. Although the room I was given was very nice (and larger than the room I asked for), my attempt to recreate a previous special getaway was ruined. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, because the mansion is very beautiful inside, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was also great. Everything about the place is relaxing and luxurious. This could be such a wonderful place to visit, but I don't feel I can recommend it to anyone because of their current management. Edit: I have been informed that the Wheeler is now under new management. The building and amenities were always four stars in my book, and so I now feel comfortable recommending it for special occasions.

221,11/26/2011,Ulo0jJ1eXR3-xl-yousTWw,"My review from http://yelp.com: I don't get to vacation too often. I think the last one I went on was 5 years ago. Earlier this week, I stayed here for my very first grown-up-all-by-myself-vacation. I booked a room for 4 nights two months ahead of time so I could get a really good rate. I only spent $89 a night. I booked through the Embassy Suites Hilton website, not through Orbitz. For a Downtown hotel, I wasn't expecting too much. And I was a bit frightened that it would be a bit gross. Apparently, that was NOT the case here! This is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at! I know it's not super-fancy, but it exceeded my expectations! I stayed in a 2-room suite with a flat screen tv in the living area and one more flat screen in the bedroom, a sofa-bed in the living room, Crabtree & Evelyn shampoos and soaps, plentiful towels, 2 additional sinks (one in the bedroom and another near the microwave and fridge), self-fluffing pillows, a very clean bed with clean, soft sheets, free cooked to order breakfast and a free 2-hour evening reception at the hotel bar! The free breakfast and the evening reception isn't over the top, but it's free! I'm so happy they at least offer it! The breakfast was very good; you can choose what kind of eggs you want or get an omelet, and they also sausages, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cereal, english muffins, donuts and other baked goods, fresh fruit (melons, bananas), yogurt. They had an awesome selection in case you don't want what they are cooking. I personally thought the omelets were pretty good. And there is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. The kitchen staff, bartenders, and housekeeping staff were all very nice and they made sure I was taken care of. Seriously, who could ask for more?!?!?! There is only 1 downside, wifi isn't free. It's $14.95 a day. It is free if you are an HH member. But it is worth it if you pay in advance for a lower room rate. I would definitely come back again and again for a quiet weekend. Or maybe a week. I love that Fox & Obel is around the corner too in case you want gourmet eats without spending too much $$$.

The location is not quite as convenient as being directly in the loop but it is very close and near enough to many shops, restaurants, cafes and the lake. The value proposition here is two fold: firstly, the room, or should I say rooms, give you more of an apartment style set up than a typical hotel room. The key here is that because you have a living room and a kitchenette area separating your bedroom from the hallway, blocking out the vast majority of noise from passer-bys. My bed was huge and comfortable. I had a view of both the lake and the city. The second area they really stand out in is the extras: all you can eat breakfast, and a two hour complimentary happy hour in the evening at the bar. Combine this with a 24 hour fitness center, a pool and sauna and it is pretty difficult not to enjoy your stay here. The staff, especially in the dining area, were exceptionally friendly. As for the drawbacks. The carpet was ugly and the interiors themselves were drab and in need of an update. The fitness center could use an update too. The style of Embassy Suites means you have a view of the exterior of all the rooms all the way up to the top floor from the lobby. Because they all look exactly the same you get the feeling of looking up at an old tenement building in a former Soviet bloc country.

The included breakfast and happy hour...wine. beer and snacks...is very welcomed if you are on a per diem or budget.    One dinner downtown can set you WAY back......That takes the edge off staying downtown and its high prices. Breakfast is the best of any of the suites hotels around the country.   The highlight is the omlette station.   A chef prepares a custom omlette for you .   You pick out all the ingredients like peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, bacon, sausage, ham, cheeses, etc.  With that you also get fried potatoes or pancakes.   Quite a wide range of selection.   There is also a large fruit area to get all your standard fruits...melons, apples, oranges, bananas, etc.  There is a danish/donut/pastry tray as well as cereals and oatmeal.   Apple, cranberry and orange juices are available as well as all the coffee.   In downtown Chicago, this would easily be a $25 to $30 breakfast if you eat alot.   Everyone in your room gets this breakfast as part of your room rate.   In addition to the breakfast is the free happy hour as well.   All the wine, beer and sodas you can drink in 2 hours as well as appetizers.  The wine is one grade above screwcap bottled wine.   Beer is standard Miller quality.    One night was puff pastry mini hot dogs and cheese balls.    The next night was buffalo wings and meatballs.   Again, in downtown Chicago, you drinking a few beers or glasses of wine plus these appetizers could easily set you back $20 to $30 per person.  However the quality was not good for the appetizers....2 stars....most of the dishes were way too salty.

In addition to the great employees, the breakfast each morning was great - and this is coming from someone who isn't a big breakfast eater!  Seriously, all these complaints about it being busy are RIDICULOUS.  Obviously it's going to be a happening place with all the options you have - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, omelettes, cereal, donuts, pastries, yogurt, fruit, soda, milk, juice, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns... How could you not be happy?!  I was there on a Saturday and Sunday morning which I assume would be busier than weekdays and both times had no problem finding tables. Now on to my cons... Parking.  Parking is $49/day.  That's probably normal for Chicago hotels, but still... that's murder, and a very pathetic way to spend $100. Exercise room.  The room is TINY and has like 5 cardio machines (3 treadmills and 2 ellipticals or something like that.  I really don't remember since I didn't get to use anything).  For a hotel of this size, that's ludicrous.  I ended up going for a jog outside in rainy, 50-degree weather which wasn't ideal, but whatever. Room issues.  None of these ""complaints"" are a big deal, but I'll share them anyway.  The sitting area/office room that you walk into is pretty big.  It has a flat screen tv, desk, etc.  (No free internet...)  And then there's the bedroom - it's small, or at least seems small thanks to the huge bed.  There was probably a foot of walking space on each side of the bed so it wasn't easy to do anything but sleep in there.  I left my suitcase, got dressed, etc in the other room.  Also, the tv in the bedroom is the old cube type...kind of strange to still see those, especially with a newer tv in the other room, and what was even stranger was the extra sink in the bedroom!  So random. Also, taking the elevator to the lobby then the lobby elevator to the ground floor was interesting, but nothing to hold against the place. 5 stars - 3 stars for cons = 2 stars plus 1 star for an overall good experience and being a ""good deal"" (minus the parking) for a total of 3 stars.   It was fine, but I'm not sure I'll stay here again.",3,0,1,0,N,ZKlOnMidHbjqmCaeb5utyw,Ali El Callejon L.,"San Francisco, CA",May 2009,38,88,0,108,52,81,45,0,2,0.07045636509207366,mzO5Ib2H4ffBmr5jpNDeQg,The Echo,"The Echo - Echo Park - Los Angeles, CA",280,4.0,"Restaurants, Arts & Entertainment, Music Venues, Nightlife, Bars, Lounges, Dive Bars, METADATA","1822 W Sunset Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90026 Neighborhood: Echo Park",Yes,$$,No,http://www.attheecho.com,(213) 413-8200,0

252,9/23/2011,G,"This Hampton Inn was great. The room was clean and comfortable, the free breakfast was good. Outstanding location !! It was a 2 block walk to the Grand red line stop and this made it very convenient for me to get to work each day (and it saved me $18 per day parking at my job site). Tons of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. My fav restaurant was Bandera. The only thing that I didn't like about this property was the $42 per day for valet parking. I think this is on par with other hotels in the downtown area, but that still doesn't make me like it. I parked at the public lot next door to the hotel for $30 per night (another steep price for parking) - this lot doesn't allow in/out. I walked everywhere or caught the train, so next time I probably wouldn't even rent a car. As mentioned in other posts for this hotel, the Fire Station is right next door and I heard the fire trucks every day. They were loud, but luckily they weren't going out frequently.

253,8/19/2009,yCh1-t-4lTztOtp3TYkowA,"I'm completely torn on how exactly to rate this hotel. There were a lot of things I liked about it, and I will probably stay here again, but it could use some improvements. The Hampton Inn is truly within walking distance of everything we really needed. We drove from Detroit, parked the truck, and only used it when going outside of downtown. We walked the magnificent mile, we walked to Millenium and Grant Parks, we walked to Navy Pier, I walked to get Kolten's hair cut. It's in a great location! Parking: never cheap doing valet! But for $42/day....We were staying here for 3 1/2 days... and it's just not justifiable in my book. I opted for the privately owned parking lot across the street for $25/day with unlimited in-and-out privileges! Note: cash only! It was impossible to get a smile out of the owner too. Valet/Bell Hops: great during the day! They saw us coming with the stroller and opened all of the doors =) At night, we were pretty much on our own. That's not a true complaint, but it should be more consistent. Breakfast: continental breakfast! The hot foods changed each morning but the rest was still more than enough to fill me up before starting out our day. Fresh fruit [grapefruit, pineapple, and oranges], box cereal, muffins, bagels, juice, coffee.... a definite plus when vacationing! Price: Excellent for the amenities offered!! Remember to book it with the discount [AAA, etc] to ensure the price quoted reflects the discount. They even allowed late check-out without any extra cost since no one had booked our particular room, which allowed us to get in some last minute stops without driving around with all of our goodies. Pool was a great way to get Kolten used to swimming and to wind down in the afternoon. It's not olympic size but there is also a jacuzzi tub and steam room in the pool area on the 2nd floor. Hotel key entry. The room itself: -industrial view. We were not blessed with a city view. More like the alleyway, but that's okay- we wanted to see the city up close and personal..not from the room window. Plus, when we were in the room, the shades were closed to drown out the light, to lull Kolten to sleep. -Major plus for mom's/traveling with young ones: kitchenette. FRIDGE, stove, microwave, dishwasher and sink. Perfect for storing Kolten's gallon of milk, drinks, fruits, string cheese, and all of our water and snacks! I was really relieved when the honey mentioned we would have the kitchenette!! -living room partitioned off with solid french-like doors. The doors needed some serious WD-40! It made the most obnoxious loud screech whenever you tried to open it. It was useless to try to open them quietly without the monster waking up. The teeth clenching and eye squint didn't help either! -Couch, a chair with ottoman in the living room and another identical set in the bedroom, 2 flat screen TVs- one in the living room and one in the bedroom, desk and office chair, kitchenette table and chairs, coffee tables, etc. Keep in mind the furniture isn't ""dingy"" per se, it could use some updating, or maybe a good steam cleaning. The upholstery looked kind of grandma-ish. -The bed- king sized with white linens and breakfast tray. This is where the magic happens...LOL! Surprisingly, this bed didn't give me the hee-bee-gee-bee's like some hotels have in the past with their floral bedspread and nasty blankets. This my friends, is comfy, clean, and crisp. Notes: 1. When up in the morning and getting a slow start, remember to put the ""Resting"" tag on door....or else the housekeeper will get a peek of your goods coming out of the shower! 2. When tilting the 1 1/2 yr old back in the office chair and spinning it around, always check underneath to make sure it has both bolts... or else the back falls off along with the child. Thankfully, he was alright, and the manager on duty came up apologizing and filed an incident report. We also got a replacement chair.

254,10/13/2007,0ohVRrArg31xg-gwtPYD9w,"Reasons why I chose the Hampton Inn Downtown in the middle of it all!  Walking distance (its good for the mind, body, and soul)! - 1 minute to Ruth's Steak House - 2 minutes to Rockit - 2 minutes to one of my favorite sports bar:  Mother Hubbards - 5 minute walking distance to Magnificent Mile - 5 minutes to the clubs (Excalibur, Cabaret, Andy's Live Jazz) - 7 minutes to Brazzaz (Brazilian Steakhouse) - 8 minutes to Hooters - 15 minutes to Millennium Park - 15 minutes to Sears Tower - 18 minutes to Bukingham Fountain - 20 minutes to Field Museum - And when I walked... I found all these intriguing hole in the wall places you can't experience when you take the taxi. King Suite - King size bed with tv, breakfast tray, and privacy doors. - Personal bath and closest with a security safe. - Living room to host your local guests. - WI-FI (so I yelp when I get back to the hotel room at 3:00am) - Kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, and small dining table with chairs. Complimentary Breakfast each morning from 6:00am-10:00am - Its not Denny's but its enough to get a big breakfast before I started my tourist day.    Now I do compliment the hospitality of the morning servers...they're friendlier than Denny's. - Okay.. its not that great.   Mostly pre-made meals like waffles, processed eggs, and a juice machine.    But I enjoyed the fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits, and sausage. Service & Hospitality - They got it down.   Smiles at the lobby.    I know I should have told her in person, but ISABELLA ... You're freakin HOT!   Thanks for helping out with my room selection and your smiles at the elevator!   * yes, i can't stop smiling when i think about IT!  * - Firm greetings by the bell service.    Easy to load and unload upon arrival or departure.    They got the great connection for taxi service and local recommends. Other Amenities & Services: - Tiny lap pool (worth visiting if you want to spend time alone and distress). - Fitness center - Skip it!  Way to small to declare it a workout center.   You're better off exploring Chicago on foot. - Luggage Hold:  Thank you Nathan for securing my luggages while I finalized my downtown Chicago visit.    This helps alot when you have a busy schedule. Drawbacks? - It's next to a fire station.   So at night, you might get the sirens depending where your room is at. - I wasn't lucky enough to get a great view of downtown Chicago.   I opened both my windows and saw a great big business building.   Argh! No major complaints here.    More compliments!   I spent about six hours a day at the Hampton Inn.    I didn't need a five start hotel because I really need a place to get some rest, keep my drinks cold, shower and change, internet access, and SPACE!    I really hate staying at crowded hotel rooms.     So this was a perfect palace for me.      Cleanliness and excellent service exists here (we'll that's because this was a King Suite).     So I officially crown Hampton Inn as my official Chicago hotel to stay.   I'll be checking in again soon in Spring 2008.",4,5,0,0,N,VBv17gn3h9W2AChr6fWZjw,Hannah G.,"Chicago, IL",February 2009,0,21,2,18,2,7,0,0,0,0.01569506726457399,LgDzWo-wjtf-86HU94BTTw,Marat Daukayev School of Ballet,"Marat Daukayev School of Ballet - Los Angeles, CA",7,4.5,"Active Life, Fitness & Instruction, Dance Studios, Arts & Entertainment, Opera & Ballet, METADATA","731 S La Brea Ave Los Angeles, CA 90036",None,None,None,http://maratdaukayev.com,(323) 965-0333,0

Air conditioning was also very flakey (coming in and out for no reason) on the hottest weekend of the year. The morning of check-out, two separate people came to the room before 10 am to ask what time we would be checking out (not to mention the maid coming twice to see if we were out of the room). After telling the two different people that we would be out of the room by 1pm, the manager then called *again to make sure we would be checking out. After paying full price for two nights at the hotel, plus drinks at the bar, plus dinner at the restaurant, we thought we'd earned the right to enjoy our last few hours in the room. Instead, we felt hurried out. When I expressed this to Emilia, the director of the front office, she responded that she was sorry, and had expressed our frustration with her colleagues. No offer for a discount on future stays with them, or even to take the $15 minibar charge off our bill.

268,8/7/2012,ngr7FS9Z3Vx8Z1DkoO4Scw,"I REALLY wanted to write a bad review for this place. Why? Because I would love to go back. Confused? Let me explain. The staff at PUBLIC cares a lot about their guests. It shows in everything they do from check in to check out. One example of this care can be seen while scouring other yelp reviews. They have a staff member who replies to negative reviews and offers to be contacted to talk it over and, I only assume, offer something in the way of compensation with a free stay. This is business 101--please the people who have not been pleased--but is something you rarely see anymore these days. So I was really hoping to have bad things to say in this review so that I could receive such contact and get to go back to PUBLIC for another night. Sadly, my experience was superb all the way through. I booked hotel PUBLIC with my Visa Signature, since it's part of their Signature Luxury Hotel Collection. This was a great idea if you're able, because it means a 2 night stay will come with $100 food/drink credit, complimentary valet parking, breakfast and a late check-out. This will help you go even further in enjoying what PUBLIC has available. Their restaurant, The Pumproom, is a slight revamp of the Chicago classic. Photos in the lower level show the hundreds of powerful people from Chicago's history who would sit down there at ""booth 1"" where they could take calls at the resident phone. Prices were hi, as expected, but food was superb in flavor and presentation and they threw in a couple shotglass sized samples of their gazpacho soup, which was a highlight. They also have ""the library,"" which sports a changing coffee shop/bar, depending on the time of day you make it there. We brought a friend with us to enjoy cocktails there on our second evening and everyone was very pleased. Everyone working there is very kind and seems very sincere. They are able to work in what is obviously a high class environment without being snobby or snooty. Swell folks. The room was comfortable, nice lighting options, great water pressure, considerate housekeeping (even plugged my laptop in for me when they were in there).

The under-window air conditioner/heater was noisy: the fan rattled and the compressor made a distinct rumble that carried through the floor to my head on the pillow. It wasn't bad enough that I think it was broken; I think it was just poorly made. The bed and linens were fantastic, and I slept soundly after I turned off the heater. (Luckily the room remained a comfortable temperature anyway.) I was awoken in the morning, though, by a loud sound that I first thought was static from the TV or iPod dock. It turned out to be just the water rushing through the pipes as my neighbor took a shower. My own shower was just above lukewarm, even with the faucet open to full hot. The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case.

272,1/22/2012,Nbc1H3dVQrVB0o8SS,"I walked through the front door of Public (which is actually on Goethe, not on State) and immediately felt like I was in the middle of someone else's wedding or charity ball.  The entire main floor was hopping with hundreds of well-dressed people socializing, drinking and lounging.  Normally, this type of scene at a hotel is represented by a demographic in their mid to late 20s.  Not at Public.  Here, the social club is comprised of many people who are 40+, but still have it going on.  This is clearly the ""it"" place to see and be seen by the non-clubbing club. I checked in at the front desk and the service was very friendly and polite.  The elevator took me to my room where I spent a couple of minutes looking for the card reader slot.  I then realized that there is no slot, you simply have to flash your card in front of the plate on your door and it opens.  That's pretty cool.   Once inside the room, I took a quick look around and was immediately reminded of hotel stays I've had in other locations.  I saw flashes of the Mondrian (Los Angeles) with all the white on white on white hues.  There were hints of The W hotel chain with all the modernistic furniture and black & white photo/art accents.  As many people have said, the aesthetics of this hotel are incredibly appealing, mixing classic old school charm with very contemporary flair. As for the functionality of the rooms, we were less impressed.  We quickly learned that beauty doesn't necessarily mean as much when you realize that the shower is so narrow you can hardly turn around inside of it.  Once you get out of the shower, there are no robes, either.  The bathrooms also have no exhaust fans (or as some refer to them ""privacy fans"").   I needed to iron a shirt and pulled the ironing board out of the closet with the iron.  I then spent the next 7 minutes trying to figure out where to plug-in the iron in a space large enough to accommodate the ironing board.  The places where outlets existed did not afford enough space for the board.  I ended up pulling the ironing board into the bathroom and pressing my shirt next to the toilet.  Yes.  I did this. At one point, my wife and I decided to check out the Library bar next to the lobby.  This is a beautiful lounge with comfy furniture, a blazing fireplace and pretty people everywhere.  The waitresses were all wearing these super skin-tight black dresses with one bright silver zipper down their backs.  While they all looked sexy as hell, I began to feel sorry for them the longer I watched them having to lean in and bend over repeatedly in those very tight and slightly revealing uniforms.   Need ice?  You're in luck if you happen to be on the 8th or 17th floors.  Otherwise, you're getting dressed and going for an elevator ride like I had to do. Granted, it was the middle of January and very dry, but our room was incredibly full of static.  Everything we touched gave us a shock, including our bed linens.  We resorted to turning on the shower in an effort to steam out the static at one point. Later, we realized that because our room was on the 3rd floor and immediately above the main entrance, it gets quite loud.  As cabs pull in and out of the valet and drunken hordes of partygoers are coming and going at all hours of the night  several honking horns and ""whoohoo"" noises easily came into our room after we had fallen asleep.   We decided to order the room service breakfast the next morning and it was delivered quickly in nice brown bags with the Public's branding all over them.  Unfortunately, the delivery guy didn't bring us a slip to sign, so I couldn't add a tip for him.  I was forced to pull out a $20 bill and ask him for change...of course, he only had $7 on him, so he got a 50% tip on delivery.   Don't get me wrong.  This is a very nice hotel worthy of many accolades.  Service is top notch.  They spared no expense making everything beautiful to the eye.  However,  we experienced a few minor inconveniences in our stay that were worth noting here.  I think we'd definitely consider staying here again sometime, especially considering the great rate we received $125/night to be in the Gold Coast and Old Town.",3,3,0,1,N,UXOe17q-SHcGyP0ab8Abfg,Chontelle Sweetie Pie M.,"Glenn Dale, MD",December 2009,127,115,8,325,150,212,103,20,6,0.1111111111111111,77XuqmkuU3VU2XYZPCquAA,McCarthy's Irish Bar,"McCarthy's Irish Bar - Lexington, KY",25,4.0,"Nightlife, Bars, Pubs, METADATA","117 S Upper St Lexington, KY 40507",Yes,$,None,None,(859) 258-2181,0

Everything was great the free wifi throughout the hotel, the clean modern gym, the nice hospitality, but when I payed for the hotel two weeks ago, I thought that was only charge I was going to receive. They didn't mention that there was a 150 dollar holding fee and being that it was a debit card the funds were withheld. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the card I was swiping for shopping and eating was running empty.

I booked on price line and got a very good deal, but when I showed up, they upgraded me to a one room suite on the 16th floor...which had the MOST amazing view of both the towers and a little picnic table and a cupboard for the dining implementry in a completely different room. The living room was done all in white and was gorgeously appointed.  The bed was a king size, low to the ground and extremely comfortable.  Very Asian in feeling, but Swedish in style. Bathroom was a little bit small, but well turned out.  There were two large flat screen tvs...I don't really watch tv, but I'm sure a sports fan or news junkie would have been pleased. The iPhone/iPod charger didn't seem to work for my 4G, but I didn't try my Nano, so I'm not sure if it was just a compatibility issue.

The hotel staff was INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating.  When I called at 12:30 am for a turkey sandwich and chocolate pudding room service delivery, they forgot or messed it up and, not being a very fussy person, I didn't bother to call back to check on it until 4:30am, where they immediately said they were SO sorry and could they please sendit up now, gratis, and also could they buy me breakfast in the morning?  Yes and yes, thanks!  That was the best 5am turkey sandwich ever.  :) I really loved my stay here and will book again in the future.",4,3,0,0,N,yruTLOggpeMXoHu_O_Zd3A,Eleni D.,"Toronto, ON",March 2010,1,55,3,76,81,25,6,2,1,0.0582010582010582,eMJDuJDsztFeTfagABW_sA,Missie B's,"Missie B's - Volker - Kansas City, MO",18,4.5,"Nightlife, Bars, Gay Bars, METADATA","805 W 39th St Kansas City, MO 64111 Neighborhood: Volker",Yes,$,None,None,(816) 561-0625,0

Not only will I stay here on my future trips to Chicago, the hotel alone makes me want to come back as soon as possible! Here are just a few of the reasons why I love this place: 1. Every single staff person throughout the hotel was friendly, warm, and welcoming. (They must hire them all from a modeling agency because they are unbelievably good-looking too!) 2. The public spaces are not only interesting looking and luxurious but also comfortable! If I have to spend 3 hours working at my hotel, why not do so sitting in a cozy sheep skin-covered chair, next to a fireplace with a delicious coffee drink! 3. Speaking of drinks, the cocktail menu is interesting and delicious as is the food menu. I haven't eaten so well since... I can't remember when! And yet the prices are affordable! 4. The social scene here is very cool. People of all races, ages, and styles make for great people watching but the mid-western charm of the clientele made me forget I was rubbing elbows with the chic and glamorous. 5. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is just an acknowledgment that we are living in a technology world and should do so without limitations. Charging for internet is like charging for air. 6. Free access to the nicest gym I have ever been to: totally unique design, more pretty people, AMAZING classes, (I'm still sore!), and top-quality gym equipment. 7.

Housekeeping staff were fantastic, and always had my room cleaned and enjoyable to return to after sightseeing.   Check-in/out was easy, though they did accidentally give me somebody else's bill under the door along with my own.  Initially reading it I was thinking I'd been doubled charged for a couple days of my stay, but then realized it was under another name.  Front desk quickly resolved it when I walked it down.   Front desk staff were very personable and professional. The rooms are well-appointed.   I would only ask for two considerations: 1) wi-fi shouldn't be based ""per device.""  I signed up on my iphone to access email while on my bed, and then when I went to use my laptop to complete some work I became aware that I had to repurchase wi-fi for that, and, if I chose to, again for my IPad.  That would be $30 for the same person.  I'm sure there are some couples out there, too, that wouldn't want to have to pay twice to obtain their emails on different phones.  You could charge a room rate, and let it go at that.  Also, as another reviewer said -- what to do with leftovers from the fantastic restaurants, including the hotel's own?  The pressure sensitive mini-bar essentially eliminates the option of taking a soda or snacks out of the mini-bar to put something in (leftover pizza, dessert, my own bottled water, whatever).   I also had a problem with my room phone sometime after day 2 -- no dial tone and couldn't be used.  I ended up needing to call the front desk for something and had to use my own phone.  Told them while I spoke about the other issue that my room phone wasn't making calls, but they didn't send anybody.  A night later, I had to call the main desk via my cell to get connected to room service, and I mentioned again I was calling because my room phone wasn't letting me make calls; no action. One other disappointment: the fitness center.  Several pieces of cardio but only 1 leg option and a multi-function piece.  If somebody else was doing their workout when you came in (as happened several times), you're stuck with cardio.  I actually found a gym a couple blocks away that had more equipment and offered a 6 session pass so that I could get in the sessions I needed.  One plus though, the Doubletree fitness center is open 24 hours -- many hotels arbitrarily close at 10 or 11p.  Still, if a good workout is important during your stay, consider other locations. That said, it was affordable, even inclusive of a holiday weekend.  My stay averaged $160.  I had considered the Intercontinental two blocks away, but that was $75 per night more...may have been somewhat better appointed according to a couple biz colleagues, but why pay so much more if you can have an overall good experience for significantly less?  And cookies, too. =)",3,0,0,0,N,tuYMK1U_uUtf8TgpJ0c9dQ,Kara Ain't No Thing.

Like others have said the parking is $41 but that is actually cheaper than many other hotels in the area. We saw signs advertising close to $60. It's downtown, to be expected. Only disappointing factor was the wifi situation. We wanted to look up some addresses but did not want to pay over $20 for decent internet speed. I was even going to go for the standard grade at $10 for 24 hours but it wouldn't let me charge it to my credit card, only the room (there was an option for it but it wouldn't activate).

We checked in pretty late at night, the person at the front desk was a lady, she was ok but either did not understand my question or did not want to answer it. I asked the lady for a room with a view, and she said, ""here are your keys, your room faces south."" I asked again, ""does it have a nice view."" Her response: ""it faces south."" UM OK? By the way, it did not have a nice view. All I saw was the building in front of me, which was all glass. I thought maybe our window was the kind of glass where we could look out, but no one could look in. No, I was wrong. I could see myself in the glass window of the building across from us. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty clean. The next morning, I had to print something for a conference, so I went to the business center, and the internet was (I think) about $6 for 15 minutes. They REALLY should NOT be charging to use internet in the business center. I understand if you charge for internet in the rooms, but really?? The internet was SO SLOW. It took 15 minutes to load http://gmail.com and open a one-page word document. I called the guy in-charge of this, his name was ""Eddie."" He was unapologetic and said ""people use this all the time."" Then he swiped his card on the other computer and asked me to use it, again same thing. It was SO SLOW and did not load. Eddie still did not apologize or anything. I looked for a fedex closeby and found one in the Marriott. It worked flawlessly. The next thing to happen was that my room key did not work. The REALLY RUDE woman at the front desk said, ""if you keep the key near your phone, it deactivates."" Well, I did not keep it near the phone, so I don't know why it deactivated.

If you are looking to venture out a bit, the train is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Chicago is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their train system is pretty good too. This Marriott is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one. The concierge here is so friendly and even funny to boot. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not.

Where the hotel fails: they try to come across like a boutique hotel, but are really just a Marriott-type hotel in knock off polyester boutique clothing; the walls are tissue paper thin and everything said can be heard; the doors slam even when you try to close them gently; they play sucky pop country music over the sound system; we had problems with our room safe, there was no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room; the shower head, a peculiar, bizarre, and intimidating two-headed device, had loose plumbing, the alarm clock was missing the backup battery, and other parts, our one room service order was screwed up, and a call to the front desk and concierge went unanswered. All of this for a premium price in the toney Gold Coast area. In this case, the positives do not out weigh the negatives, which is surprising since the Westin is part of the Starwood properties.

It is conveniently located on Michigan and Delaware. Right in the Magnificent Mile area and across the street from the John Hancock Center. In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one!

I requested my sheets get changed at the end of the night -- because, of course, the beau and I dirtied em up acting like 12 years olds, jumping around like fools -- and it happened rather quickly. The cleaning lady even engaged in a nice conversation with me as she cleaned. Very pleasant. I thought we had a great view and I was quite sad we had to leave and venture out into the real world.

And, it'd be awesome if they could toss a couple of iPod radio docks in there for those who just want to enjoy the view and listen to some tunes.

389,2/1/2009,rZhz9P2qB,"I haven't stayed at this property in a while so it was time for a checkup.   Located at the north end of Michigan Avenue this property is all about location, location, location.  In the shadow of the Hancock center, a stones throw from Watertower Place and abundant, restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The last time I stayed here the management was totally inept and I ripped off a seething letter.  I was happy to be informed that the individual, who made my previous stay hell, has been relieved of his duties. Other than a long line at check in this property this property has improved by leaps and bounds. Long line at check in as staff was changing shifts. There is a dedicated Starwood Gold/Platinum line.  The G/P line was unoccupied as I waited in line and opened, alone with another check in, when I was second in line. The lobby and common areas are very clean, bright, well lit and maintained.  In the lobby they have a refreshment center right next to check in line. The room I was assigned comprised of a nice sized bedroom and corner parlor to make up a pretty large suite. The suite was large enough to accommodate several people. Overall First Impression, renovated and on par with the DC and Philly Westin's I've recently visited.  This Westin's Heavenly bed wasn't as firm as I like, but all the accoutrements of the Heavenly Bed was there.  The room is decorated in a casual modern decor and in good condition.  Décor is appropriate for Downtown urban hotel.  The closet was a bit on the tiny side, for a room it's size the closet seemed out of proportion.  The 27"" TV is a disappoint, but I understand that they will be upgraded to 40"" sets soon. There is ample lighting in the room and the room has large windows so there is a ton of natural light.  The workspace desk shares the ice chest and other items and could be a problem for some.  There were extra electric outlets in the room for those with lots of devices.  The room has a nice  view since it is a corner room.  You can see up and down Michigan Avenue.  No iPod docking station and a dated radio.  Starwood has to up it's game in this area. Very long narrow bathroom, but no separate shower.  I found that odd for a bathroom of this size.  While in the bathroom I could vaguely hear people in the hallway.  The bathroom has dual sinks with lots of counter space and great lighting. A heavenly bath but no separate shower. The parlor connected from the bedroom.  Walking out of the bedroom into the parlor there was a nice sized bathroom.  With amenities that matched the bedroom bathroom.   There was a large desk with lots of outlets and a great view looking south on Michigan Avenue.  The room is a nice size and has a sofa, two club chairs and few ottomans.  The is a Murphy bed and a huge closet.  In addition, the parlor has a Bose radio.   The housekeeping staff was adequate. I had the DND sign on the door and was never interrupted.  They replaced all items and toiletries on each night of my stay.  Received turndown service every evening. This Westin features a nice sized Fitness Center with up to date cardio machines & ellipticals, a smaller room with free weights off to the side. There is no pool or club lounge at this property. Free Internet in the lobby, $13 a night in rooms.  Signal was strong throughout the suite and suffered no interruptions. Did not use valet, as there is no car for a car in Chicago.  The hotel is convenient to public transportation, cabs are plenty and always ready right out the front door. FINAL IMPRESSION Overall hotel cleanliness: On par with other Westin properties and cleaner than the W's Staff attitude, conduct & support: Staff has greatly improved, over my last stay.  The staff has had a complete overhaul for the better.  Everyone was prompt and attentive. Location: Great location. Can walk to your office (if on business), restaurants, attractions, parks, and shopping. Would I return? Yes. Would I recommend this as family friendly? No. Good for business travelers? Yes. Good for a romantic get away?  Yes, nice rooms and spa services. Would I recommend for someone looking for Dining/Nightlife? Yes Would I recommend restaurant?

The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. Each time I've reserved a room, I've requested to be placed away from the El train and have been accommodated.They upgraded their internet service sometime between my stays there in 2010 and 2011, and I had no trouble at all with the wi-fi. The hotel is in a GREAT location for visiting downtown Chicago. CTA trains that circle the Loop have a stop right at the intersection where the hotel is located. Millenium Park is just down the block, and the Magnificent Mile is approximately ten blocks away. There is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and for venturing further out, trains and cabs are easily accessible. I've stayed, and plan to stay, at the Silversmith during the Chicago Marathon. I'm sure the price is higher during this weekend, but when compared to other hotels in the area, even those officially partnered with the Marathon, the Silversmith was the best price and in a better location than most. The only reason I didn't give five stars, and I'm sure this doesn't matter to most, is that I feel they need to upgrade their TV's. I know, it's a minor thing, but if you're looking to keep the kids entertained or, like me, your looking to spend time in the room preparing for or recovering from a REALLY long run, the TV thing is important.

We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies.

The hotel and room is a bit dated, but as many have said, it is clean and the rooms are relatively large.  I was traveling alone, but if I was with others, the roomy bathroom would definitely be a plus.  My suite had large windows in the bedroom, so since it was cold, there was a bit of a battle between the heater and the coldness coming off the windows, but it was not a major issue.  As far as the train goes, you do hear it.  However, it's not noticeable if you are accustomed to city noises.  If you need silence, this isn't the place.  But that's not to say that it's noisy, either.  As a matter of fact, besides the noise you might expect from outside, it almost seemed as if there were only a few people staying at the hotel. The free internet was nice, but I did have some problems with it.  The signal was intermittent, so at times my screen would freeze when loading or refreshing.  It would definitely be nice if wireless was available throughout the hotel. USA Today is available on weekdays, but don't expect it on your doorstep.  I like a leisurely morning where I can relax and read the paper in the morning, so I was just a tad disappointed when the first morning I found out I had to pick up the paper at the front desk. A couple times, I had problems with my key card and had to get it reset.  Again, a minor convenience. Considering the location and what the hotel offers, I would say that overall staying at The Silversmith is a great value.  If you don't need the features of the bigger hotels offer and don't insist on modern decor, this may be one of the best hotels in the area in terms of value.",4,0,0,1,N,vicE5WHdFHgQUHIoydnK_Q,Carolyn W.,"Streamwood, IL",April 2010,0,20,2,11,1,0,0,0,0,0.02188183807439825,2vH97bk84vOwEbGFkjMVbw,Ruchi Indian Cuisine,"Ruchi Indian Cuisine - Overland Park, KS",52,3.5,"Restaurants, Indian, Pakistani, METADATA","11168 Antioch Rd Overland Park, KS 66210",Yes,$$,No,http://www.ruchicuisine.com/,(913) 661-9088,0

The location of the hotel can't be beat, as it's on Jeweler's Row at the corner of Madison and Wabash; easy to get to and within walking distance to TONS of places, including the Amtrak station, Grant Park, and Michigan Avenue. Taxis, buses, and the El train are all very accessible as well, so getting just about anywhere is a breeze. Even better are the shops and restaurants just outside the front door, making it very easy to find anything you may need during your stay. The hotel itself is ""old world"" in style/decor, but the amenities are definitely modern: high-speed internet access, a roomy, updated bathroom, and a powerful AC unit are all worth mentioning. The rooms are on the small side, but that's to be expected given the hotel's downtown location. The only complaint I have about the room is regarding the beds, which were rock-hard. This is pretty typical for hotels nowadays, though, so I wasn't too surprised; it was just the only thing that kept the experience from being 5-star. FYI, our bed was king-sized. I've read there are some people who were bothered by the noise of the El train, which passes right outside the hotel. The key to this is to get a room at the back of the hotel, away from the street. That's what we did, and the noise was barely noticeable; it just sounded like it was raining whenever the train passed by. It's MUCH louder when you're facing the street, though, including when standing in the lobby. Just something to keep in mind when booking. Another thing to note is that the hotel does have several adjoining rooms. This was not something I remembered reading anywhere, so I thought I'd mention it; we would have taken advantage of that had we known about it. The staff was very accommodating and friendly, allowing us to check in early (around 1:30pm) and storing our bags after we'd checked out.

427,9/18/2012,ZFTHWbjwNXLk5M0qdQ,"I'm a sucker for old-world charm and was drawn to the Hotel Burnham after seeing photos online of the historic building and exquisite interior.  I booked a king lake view suite after reading reviews that the normal rooms were quite small, plus I really wanted a view, which is something that Chicago hotels know and will absolutely charge you for.  It was a bit more than I would have liked to pay but I kinda said ""screw it, I want to experience this place"" and I'm glad I did.  I knew I'd made the right choice when they handed me a REAL key not a stupid key card (which in my experience are faulty or need recoding 50% of the time). The picture windows are lovely; I was staying on the 12th floor with a view down state street out of one window and the park and lake out of the other.  Great for random people-watching too: I even caught a glimpse of a newly-married couple taking wedding photographs in the middle of the street down a few blocks in front of the Chicago theater! What made this stay particularly memorable was the exceptional service.  Staff members went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience.  In the lobby there is a wine social hour in the evening and fresh-brewed coffee in the morning (which I didn't realize when I asked the hotel to bring me a coffee maker the night before - oops!)  Prior to my arrival, I got a personal email from Suze, who checked in with me to ask about my room preferences, if I wanted them to book me a dinner reservation anywhere, and inquire about if I was celebrating any special occasions or had additional requests.  I was in fact celebrating an acceptance into grad school, let them know this, and there was a little bouquet of flowers with a congratulatory card awaiting me in the room.  I was also traveling with my infant daughter who is one, and had asked for a crib in the room - it was already made up and waiting for me when I arrived.  Also worth noting is I showed up in the morning way before check-in time, but the room was all ready set up and ready to go, which was a  nice surprise.  I really appreciate that the staff connects with its guests before they arrive - so many places just send out an impersonal automated email generated by their bookings page, and it was nice to know an actual human was taking care of me. The pictures don't do this place justice.  The building, the lobby, the staircases, elevators, and my room were all just breathtaking.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat if it weren't so expensive!",5,0,0,0,N,ydakqMFCPLbr9cWGpLlNew,Sean D.,"St Louis, MO",September 2010,8,21,1,16,1,4,0,0,0,0.02759526938239159,Xni4rF5gl2Hye_ORnpfa9Q,Mariscos Vera Cruz,"Mariscos Vera Cruz - Olathe, KS",4,4.0,"Restaurants, Mexican, METADATA","117 S Kansas Ave Olathe, KS 66061",Yes,$$,None,None,(913) 397-6940,0
428,1/24/2012,zhi9t6Ob1,"Me: ""I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel"". Typical reaction: ""What is that? A Marriott, Hilton, Starwood Hotel?"" For those who don't know, Kimpton is chain of 100 boutique hotels that are located in most of the major metropolitan cities in America and no, they are not associated with any of the major hotel brands.   In the hypercompetitive hotel service industry, I really think that there are only a few things that a hotel can do to stand out.  One, the hotel creates a once in a lifetime experience by charging an astronomical price (say...overwater bungalows in Bora Bora) or goes the bargain/cheap route for the price conscientious customer.  For most, anything in-between seems to be an experience that is soon be forgotten unless you are tied into a loyalty/reward system that makes you go back to a hotel chain. So what makes Kimpton hotels stand out? Simple.  They provide 5* service at realistic price points for consumers.   FACT: They have the highest customer satisfaction scores and emotional attachment scores of all hotel chains operating in the United States. How so? Service: 1)  As I checked into my room, I had a hand written ""welcome back"" card that specifically stated that they hope I enjoy my second visit.  I visited Kimpton 4 months ago for the first time, and they pulled this info and prepared for my visit before I checked in. Amazing. 2)  They called 10 min after I got into my room to see if I needed anything. 3)  Three to four hours later, an employee brings me a complimentary bottle of Chianti.  Unfortunately I could not have this b/c I had some important things to do the following day so he asked if he could bring me anything else to drink like juice or lemonade.  In 5 minutes, he brought me complimentary ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade.  Madness. Perks: 1) $10 bonus perk card for loyalty program members for every stay.  You can spend the $10 on anything in the fridge and in the snacks cabinet.  They have organic snacks, coke, beer, wine, chips, chocolate bars, you name it.  Although they are a bit overpriced, you can pick out 2-4 things without paying a dime.  Hey you can't complain b/c it's free :) 2) Rotating loss-leader specials.  For example, the Kimpton hotel chain is now offering 2 cocktails for $1 at the bar until the end of your stay.  Yeah.  Tell me a hotel chain that does that. 3) Complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning and wine and champagne in the afternoon (at the lobby). 4) Free wifi by being a loyalty program member.  This comes in handy in large metropolitan cities where all hotels charge for wifi. Add all these perks to a great bed that rivals the Westin's Heavenly Bed and fantastic decor to boot at around ~$110 a night.  It is almost impossible to find this kind of deal anywhere. The service and the quality of my stays has made me reconsider my priceline bidding strategies in the cities where Kimpton Hotels are located.  For a marginal difference of $20-$30, I am not so sure that the price difference warrants my risking landing an unproven hotel using priceline. As much as the service may not sound ""phenomenal"" for my review, my general feeling is that they would have gone completely out of their way and would have done outrageous things to make me happy.  I was sold.  Kimpton you won a loyal customer and a well-deserved 5* review!",5,7,4,1,N,TIrOT3y33xydiOnNSqDvOA,Hang T.,"San Jose, CA",September 2006,123,509,15,455,151,195,80,95,7,0.22907290729072907,0shYKnSffY-eOTq2GX4-4Q,Stroud's Restaurant,"Stroud's Restaurant - Fairway, KS",76,3.5,"Restaurants, American (Traditional), METADATA","4200 Shawnee Mission Pkwy Fairway, KS 66205",Yes,$$,No,http://www.stroudsrestaurant.com,(913) 262-8500,0

My room's window was huge! It felt like I was looking out in HD; everything was so crisp and clear.

The hotel is located at State and Washington, and the view down State Street from our corner room on the 12th floor was awesome! During the Christmas season, the hotel is right across from Macy's and a block away from the Chicago Christmas tree. It's a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. So, walking around right out of the hotel was great and then catching a cab was trivial as well. It's a max $10 cab ride to pretty much anywhere, for example, Lincoln Park. The ambiance is boutique: small and casual. The service isn't snooty or smothering. The lobby is tiny with a fireplace and a couple comfy chairs. Our room was a suite but was still smaller than a more modern hotel. That was fine; it was a great setup and the windows on a corner room were huge.

439,8/8/2007,cbAOpJxWMHlXtbwvk7WxzA,"I stayed at the Burnham on my fifth trip to Chicago in the last couple years. I have stayed at a different four-star hotel on each visit. The Burnham was probably my favorite of the bunch.   The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and the location can't be beat. Right on the corner of State and Washington with very easy access to the Red and Blue lines. When they finish the new building at 108 N. State there will be a new Blue line station and new access to the Orange line. That means the Burnham will have easy access to either airport. After reading ""The Devil in the White City"" I was very interested in seeing some of Burnham and Root's (& Atwood's) work first hand.  To have the opportunity to stay in one of their buildings was incredible. The Reliance Building is absolutely beautiful and Kimpton has done a great job of retaining the building's classic charm while adding their own quirky touch. I didn't have a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, as there are too many food choices and must-eats in Chicago to being with, but it looked great and seemed to be doing some great business. The upper floors all have the original office building doors with frosted glass and mail slots.  I believe they are on the 8th floor and higher. I was on the 10th floor and we had a great view north to the Chicago Theater and the river. The views to the northeast would be great as well. Our room was small, which is expected in a building this old, but very well decorated and comfortable.

Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... ""ask and ye shall receive"", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH!

We were fortunate to have a corner room with views of State and Washington Streets. Views of the parks of course, Macy's (world's second largest department store), and the Chicago Theater. Everything is at your foot steps... The Jewelery District, Water Taxi, Magnificent Mile, parks, and museums. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the visit besides the great jazz was the Chicago skyline of monuments. Our room was extremely comfortable with properly scaled furniture. Velour head board with overhead sheer canopy, matching curtains scripted with Mozart tunes covering the bay windows that were screened with sheer french drop curtains for daytime privacy. Coffee & tea was available each and every morning and on Labor Day, there was an arrangement of donuts, sweets and bagels.

I ran across the street, but slowed down as I entered the hotel lobby and smiled at the front desk staff as I made a bee-line toward the stairs.

Our TV was broken, which wasn't the worst thing in the world because most of our trip was spent sightseeing, but it was kind of a bummer when we got back at night and wanted to put it on. The maid ASKED us if we wanted our room cleaned (YES!). The WiFi was free, but was so painfully slow I half expected to hear the hissing of a dial up connection. However, the location is fantastic, very close to the Navy Pier, walking distance to Millenium Park, nice area of the city, good restaurants nearby.

Gross - Our 16th floor room had no view whatsoever other than other tall buildings - Super small bathroom- I had to put on makeup with the bigger mirror on the floor lobby - Only 2 elevators and one broke at one point so only one can be used - No full length mirror anywhere :/ - No bathroom in the lobby area Next time I go to Chicago I think it may be worth it to spend a little bit more money to stay at a better place.

467,4/11/2011,cEp4pzRXFfXLt-qr1gFc,"I usually travel on a budget, but this Red Roof really drops the ball. Strike one: The rooms are not clean!! That's the most important quality about a hotel. Wouldn't you rather sleep on a slab on concrete in an immaculately clean room than a soft mattress in a room full of dust and dirt? There were large piles of dust in the corners in the bathroom, and the corners of the sink had caked on dirt. The grout on the floor was cracked and stained different colors. Most Motel 6s that I've been in are better maintained/cleaner than this room. Strike two: One of the elevators was broken. According to previous reviews, this is something that happens pretty frequently. For a hotel with 16 floors, you would think that they would have people on call for repairs like this, especially for a spring weekend when there are lots of guests. The rooms are a tight fit, but most rooms in metropolitan areas are going to be small.  The mattress was nearing the end of its life, and yes, the bedspreads are icky.  Our toilet tank was a little leaky, so the toilet would spontaneously flush itself when no one was in the bathroom. This place would have gotten one star if it hadn't been for the EXCELLENT customer service from the front desk. The people working there were patient and polite, even with a constant stream of guests arriving at the desk. We had booked the room through a third-party site, and the woman at the desk made sure that we had two non-smoking rooms next to each other and let us check-in early. They sent up extra pillows to the room when we asked. I was really happy with the service we received. The valet parking guys were really nice, too. Parking was $36 with in/out privileges, which was a better deal than parking in the garage across the street.  TIP:  If you park at that parking garage, the Courtyard Mariott gives out blue parking tickets to give you a discount on the daily rate.  It may be a little dishonest since you are not staying at that hotel, but if you're checking out a review for a Red Roof, then I have a feeling you don't have extra cash burning a hole in your pocket. Even though this is a great location at a good price, I would try to use Priceline or Hotwire to get a better room at a nicer hotel for the same price.",2,0,0,0,N,XDgKe98qTvxuHNuwUVLwNA,Ron S.,"Redwood City, CA",August 2008,6,12,0,7,4,15,2,4,0,0.00788436268068331,TJySaDFj7LC02qW-NSDp9A,HyVee,"HyVee - Overland Park, KS",8,4.0,"Food, Grocery, Restaurants, American (Traditional), METADATA","11552 W 95th St Overland Park, KS 66214",Yes,$$,No,http://www.hy-vee.com/,(913) 894-1983,0

Wifi was spotty in some areas of my second floor room but I can't complain because other hotels in the same price range were charging $10-15/day. While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago.

I am very light sleeper; if you are not, completely disregard the next paragraph. This hotel is noisy.  Not so much from other rooms/hallways - but the outside noise was awful.  We were in staying in the back of the hotel with our window facing the alley, and at random times throughout the night (sometime multiple times) garbage trucks would come along and smash and crash through the approx 30-40 garbage bins lining the alley.  After enduring the clanging a couple of nights, I asked to be moved to a room at the front of the hotel, but was told that there was nothing there in the same price range (apparently you pay more for a ""non-alley view"").  But after another couple of sleepless nights, we were finally moved to another room.  It was on a lower floor, on the front side of the hotel and was definitely better without the gargabe trucks, but still suffered from late-night party goer noise. Other than that - this hotel was fantastic! Nicely decorated, high end bath products and double shower heads.  The continental breakfast was good, more than adequate, but the real kicker is the nightly manager's reception.  Wow.  High end booze and fancy snacks (hummous, bruscetta, meat & cheese, etc).  The hotel signature drink, the Amalfitini, is addictive.  Don't be surprised if you wobble out of there after downing 4 or 5 of them - they go down so easy. The staff were friendly, and our room was cleaned every day before we returned from our touring (coming back to a still-dirty room is a major pet peeve of mine).

We were in Chicago on business and needed to use the printer in the business center.  I called ahead before we even booked and asked about their business center.  They assured me that they had building-wide wifi as well as a printer that guests could use. When we arrived, I attempted to print 4 sheets of paper for an upcoming meeting.  The page was streaked.  Printer read: Change Black Ink.  So I called down, thinking it would be no big deal, and they happily said they would send someone up.  Okay.  I left for the meeting and went about my day.  The next day I went down to the business center and the printer was doing the same thing.  They never changed the cartridge.  I called the front desk and they assured me again that they would send someone up.  2 hours later, nothing had changed.  I called again and they said I could use the front desk's printer.  I went down and they very nicely printed off about 15 pages for me (though it was odd that the guy at the desk wanted to log into my email account himself... ""okay, what's your password.""   Umm, no.  The next day I went down to the business center to print our boarding passes -- three guys in suits are in there complaining about how the printer is streaking and says it needs a new cartridge.  Ridiculous. The wifi in the building is a joke. I was on the 6th floor and couldn't get a signal.  If you're on the 4th floor (where the business center is), then you might get one, so request that floor.  They had to send up an ethernet cable for me to connect to the internet. Finally, the breakfast was lame.  I understand you want to be able to advertise ""free breakfast,"" but the food was generally stale, especially the bagels.  It was nice to have free coffee, so I can't complain about it that much since I'm not big on breakfast.  If you are expecting even the equivalent of a Hampton Inn, you'll be dismayed.

517,7/18/2011,0bxM9rNODD2mSarZZb,"We decided last minute to head to the city for the weekend. We did the usuall research and shopping on travel sites and came across the Amalfi. We prefer boutique type hotels over the huge mainstream hotels in the city, a couple of our other favs (the W, Dana and Wit) were sold out. The Almalfi had an advertised rate of $199 per night for the weekend...almost too cheap so we did more research just to make sure, read lots of great reviews so we booked it. When we arrived we checked in with what might have been record time for hotel check-in, it took all of about 1 minute or less. The Lobby is small but beautifuly decorated. When we opened the door to our rom we were pleasantly suprised, we were on the the top floor with a pretty decent view up and down State St. The room was on the small side but very clean, very nice decor and a comfy bed and a large bathroom big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. All in all an ultra bargain for a weekend room in Chicago. Our $199 per night rate included their complimentary happy hour cocktails in the lounge every night from 5:00-7:00pm as well as complimentary continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The hotel staff was helpfull and friendly and housekeeping did a great job. There are nicer places in the city but nothing in this price range will compare. The hotel and price paired with the great River North location on State St has pushed the Amalfi to the top of our Chicago hotel list.

This is a nice touch and  very convenient especially  after a late night on the town.  They also offer a free evening  cocktail hour in a "" lounge"" on the 6th. floor.  We went upstairs to have our free drinks, but  found a long line of  people waiting to get inside.  We took a pass on the drinks. Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  Here's why... 1. The room was small and narrow.  It was ok for one night, but too small for more than that. 2. Noise.  Our room faced the alley and we heard garbage trucks , homeless people, hotel workers and people from the building next door all night long. 3.

They: - double-booked our room - gave our non-smoking room to someone who came earlier in the day - only had one smoking room left in the entire hotel - would not give us any benefits in return (except breakfast - which we had already booked at a MUCH better place weeks in advance as well) - left stains, hairs, dead flies and dead mosquitos on our beds - AND the types of hairs that shall not be named in our tub - and then charged us an extra $70 (which they didn't tell us when we left, I had to find it on my credit card bill, and call them to have them remove the unwarranted charge) REVOLTING!!!!

Upon arrival the front desk lady was really friendly and was able to grant my wish of a room on a high floor (34th) looking out towards the lake. The view was amazing. The room was huge. The bathroom AREA was separate from the rest of the room. When I say area, there was a power area with its own mirror and bench, the actual bathroom which had a tub, a very nice stand alone marble shower, the sink area, and then the toilet had its own little closet within the actual bathroom. It was a little weird that there was no tank on the toilet and had a flushing system similar to what you would find in a stadium. This was really my only gripe. Besides that, everything was very nice. The TV was a 42"" flat screen. The bed was super soft with very nice pillows. There was a couch area with its own coffee table. There was a desk area as well. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, with about anything or any alcohol you could ever want. However, I'm sure everything in it was really expensive, i couldn't tell you for sure because there wasn't a price sheet, which was a bummer.

542,4/20/2011,lSB3jIM-WtfTb,"Warning.  My stay here was compliments to my company a.k.a. I'm only writing this review on my stay and not making any judgments on price. I've stayed in Chicago before, near the Drake, and expected similar sized rooms.  In other words, small, like what you'd expect in New York.  When I walked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised.  If I was the one paying for this, I'd probably have my whole family staying in the room!  That.  Big.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but this certainly is a luxury hotel.  Walking in, I noticed the king sized bed and couch sitting more than six feet away from the bed. I then did the usual hotel ritual--looked through/at everything.  I ventured to the restroom and saw a standing shower (rain shower for the win!) and a separate tub.  The toilet was in its separate room as if this was a master suite bathroom.  There was also a vanity.  Nice! In the morning, I ordered room service--french toast with bruleed bananas.  While the service was really great (he ended coming back up to collect the tray without my calling) and helpful, I would say the bananas were a bit over bruleed.  But I guess that's just nitpicking. Although, if I was only rating this off of the environment of the room and room service itself, I would give it four stars.  Sadly, poor internet service and the area bumped it down.  First, the area: while not bad, there's really not that much to do around the hotel at night if you don't take a cab and don't know anything about Chicago.  Granted, that's just a qualm about living downtown, but still. Now poor internet service.  First, no free wi-fi in the lobby.  For some reason, I thought that was fairly common, but no.  $14 per day.  Though not bad, the service was SLOW.  I tried sending and receiving a few times from my work laptop and my iPhone (with AT&T's crappy service) got the messages and sent the messages even before they were received!  Muh. This was certainly a great stay for free, but would I return?  Mm maybe.  Then again..I live in Chicago.",3,0,0,0,N,UySLQuZU6SOuuMO4J74x7w,Steven F.,"San Francisco, CA",January 2011,146,106,0,56,22,29,11,14,1,0.16588419405320814,HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA,Cotogna,"Cotogna - Financial District - San Francisco, CA",474,4.0,"Restaurants, Italian, METADATA","490 Pacific Ave (between Montgomery St & Osgood Pl) San Francisco, CA 94133 Neighborhood: Financial District",Yes,$$$,No,http://www.cotognasf.com/,(415) 775-8508,0

545,9/11/2009,N1nOhMpvR706RCrFsKwMng,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont in Santa Monica so maybe I expected too much from this location, but at the Santa Monica location, my God, you're treated like a king.  It almost gets to the point of being a little embarrassing.  Similarly, this location positions themselves as a top tier ""luxury"" hotel.  Definitely not the case.   I'll start on the positives and work my way down: LOCATION: One of the best possible locations in the city, no question.  You're right in the heart of it all.     LOBBY: Great design of the lobby, very 'male'.  My wife suggested that they need some flowers to soften it up a little, of course I'm oblivious to a note like that, looked cool to me. The doormen were super friendly. ROOMS-LAYOUT: Very disappointed.  We walked in and were like, really?  This is IT?  Literally, it looked no better than a Holiday Inn, very small.  The furniture looked nice but it was form over function... literally, you get TWO drawers for clothes.  Hopefully you are traveling by yourself or your party packs SUPER lightly.   It's a little nit-picky, but why in the world is the TV lined up with the wall of the hallway (dividing the main room from the bathroom area) while the two-drawer seat is lined up with the end of the bed?  Maybe someone crashing in the hallway wants to watch some ESPN?   ROOMS-NOISE LEVEL: What in the world is up with the 120 decibel toilet?  I don't care that it looked like something you're see at a roadside gas station, but my Lord, when you flush it is insanely loud.  With our baby sleeping in the main room, we would try to not wake her; closing the outside bathroom door, closing the immediate bathroom door, and literally taking a robe, wrapping it around the closed toilet, hugging, then hitting the lever... and it would STILL jolt her awake.  I'm not even exaggerating. The doors close normally then - BANG!!  It just bangs shut, soooo loud.  You learn, after the first round of stink-eye you receive after you startle everyone awake, to ease the door closed... however, all night long, count on your neighbors' doors banging shut.  The walls were paper thin and it got annoying. SERVICE: This is were they really lost me.  Maybe it was just in our case but compared to the Santa Monica location, it really was like a 'get over it' attitude.   When we booked this two months prior, we were crystal clear that we needed a crib, which is standard (it was waiting for us in our Santa Monica room, even with toys!).  We called the week before as well as the day or so before to remind them about the crib, ""No problem.""  When we got there?  No cribs left.  Awesome.  I asked the worker at the desk, ""What should we do with our baby?""  ""I don't know what to tell you, Sir.""  I guess saying 'Sir' and 'Mr.' helps sugarcoat bad news. So the first night we had to sleep with our 11 month old in our bed, trying not to crush her during the night, trying to make sure she didn't quietly wake up and roll off the bed onto the hard floor.  This would have been a deal-breaker had we known they weren't going to come through on this.  On the second day, they finally got us one. CHARGES DON'T DRINK THE WATER!!!  They lock the mini-bar and you can only open it if you request the key, which we obviously didn't want.  At the Santa Monica location, however, they set out complementary bottled water.  ANY hotel puts tags on the water if they plan on charging you for this... not here!  The water's sitting right out there for the taking, no tags, no indication that they will be a charge, but get ready to pay $10.58 for two small waters when there is a CVS right across the street.  This is just flat out b.s., don't rip me off with something like this.  I called down, got a couple ""Sirs"" but they wouldn't take it off the bill. MISC: -There was a nail polish type of smell in the hallway every day. -$1 a page to print at the ""Business Center""!?  It's like $.05 at Kinkos (which is around the corner, thank God... my wife needed to print a 60 page script). -No free internet at this ""luxury"" hotel unless you're a member of the President's Club, which, fortunately, we were... sucks for other guests though.  Internet is standard these days, it's like paying for cable. OVERALL: I gave it two stars because one star would have been overly harsh, a one star is something like a Motel 6, but the rooms aren't that much better - no pool, bad service, constantly nickle and dimed.  What's the point of paying this price point?  A hotel with basically the same location and everything else is Hotel 71 (where my parents stayed) for about $100 a night, a fraction of the Fairmont.  I'd highly recommend that over this Fairmont.

Good business hotel, and perfect for our Lollapalooza weekend due to its proximity to Grant Park. The service staff are all professional and friendly. Two points to note: 1. I partied all night on my last night there and went to sleep at 730am - asked for a 1030 wake up call. They called twice, and of course I didn't hear the phone.. and because I didn't pick up, they sent someone to knock on the door and wake us up. That's service. 2. My friend B dropped his wallet at the entrance when he left for the airport before us, and they immediately tracked back to which room he stayed in.. called us, and told us to let him know asap. Good thinking guys! The reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I noticed that the bathroom wasn't cleaned that impeccably for a place that costs $300 a night. The towels were replaced and all, but the floor wasn't swept and the T.P. was almost not replaced in time. So that was the only bad thing. OH.. and they don't have a swimming pool.

We were welcomed into the hotel lobby, then swept up the stairs. All was fine until we walked into the ballroom... I've heard that there are a few beautiful ball rooms in this hotel, but this one was somewhat lacking. It transported me back to my days of bat and bar mitzvah's on the north shore of Long Island. Two big glitzy gold chandeliers, a small dance floor, mirrors on both sides of the walls, and... that's about it.  The ceilings were kind of low, too, and coupled with the dim lighting in this space, it felt kind of oppressive. Throw in  two severely understaffed free-standing bars (read: one bartender at each bar) with rude bartenders (probably overstressed, overworked, and underpaid), and you see why this event venue was a disappointment. For the restaurant: 2.5 stars. I'd read some good things about Aria, but having given it two shakes, I've decided I don't like it. For the price, you can easily find better food and a much more aesthetically pleasing environment. I will say, however, that they have a very delicious mushroom soup. I believe it's something like ""mushroom soup your mother never made."" I think my greatest qualms with the restaurant is the space. It's very long and narrow, making it awkward to maneuver around.

549,7/5/2009,y1OziMO7GZkutQ3Bitu,"Stayed here on the night of July 4th even though I live in the South Loop.  The main reason was that I was being ""kicked"" out of my own apt because of a bachelorette party.   Got the Fairmont through PL as the ""luck of the draw."" Pictures: http://www.facebook.com/… Categorically: A) Star Rating: PL ranks Fairmont as a 4 star establishment.  I am not sure what qualifies them to be so, but I assume it has to do with the number of amenities that are in the actual complex, not by the shape of the amenities.  I thought that for a 3.5 star hotel, Embassy Suites in Lombard was much more well-maintained and spacious than Fairmont. B) Location: Fairly decent location in ""Millenium Park.""  Since it is located close to where I used to work, I had no problems navigating.  A word of caution: the physically address listed is 200 N. Columbus, but if you actually look up where 200 N. Columbus is, it's the lower part of the street.  The auto entrance is there, but the main pedestrian entrance is upstairs on S. Water St.   C) Public Spaces: I did not get to check all of these out, but these are the ones that I did see and go into, at least to look: the main Eno Bar area in the registration area, Aria restaurant, and Aria Bar.  The lighting in all these areas was fairly dim, to a fault I would say.  Even the escalators that went down from the main lobby level to the ballrooms and parking area weren't the brightest, but they were much better than the other.   I will post my review of Aria Bar where appropriate.  Also included at the complex were ballrooms, a spa, and business centers as well as meeting rooms. D) Room.  The room I got was a double bed on the 5th floor.  Not much to say about the view, but I didn't have high expectations about that.  Room came with: safe, ironing board, extra comforter, a little mirrored/vanity area, bathrobes, the usual English ""boutique"" toiletries, separate rain shower and tub, BMI scale (did not use this, ha), a phone in the toilet area, LCD TVs mounted very well on the wall, art mounted behind the headboard, couch, and working desk/table.  Walls were not very thick, and I could hear other guests walking about, as well as the people next door who were initially fighting when I got there.  Babies.

It's a walkable distance, but plan on a brisk 30 minute walk before you start to get to areas that are interesting. The second drawback is that apparently the walls are thin.

593,6/25/2007,x5nmwaiAWBXu2miF8a4fug,"4.5 stars..... We stayed in a suite at this hotel, and it was one helluva room.  I loved it.  Views cover 2 of the 4 walls in the suites, and the bed feels like a cloud dropped out of heaven.  What more can you ask for? However - - it loses the 1/2 star solely because it's out in the middle of nowhere.  Unless you have reason to be near the Convention Center, which is conveniently located right next to the hotel (attached, actually) then there really is no reason to be at Hyatt McCormick.  (This is the reason we were at this location to begin with, obviously.) To get to ""downtown"" or the more happening areas of Chicago, it will generally be a $10+ cabride there, and then again, on the way back.  After a week there, this can accumulate to quite a sum.    The only plus side to this is that you get to drive up and down Michigan Ave during all times of the day/night, and see what's happening.  This would be nice if you rented a car... but then driving home after a night out will STILL be quite a hike! Many things about the Hyatt McCormick indicate it IS indeed a hotel all about business, and even the staff seem accustomed to dealing with people traveling for business - not pleasure, in that they are rather curt, get the job done, and no small talk, no extra smile, or anything.  Their goal is to get people in, and out as efficiently as possible.  No complaints, but you can tell you're not in California anymore.  :-) Bathrooms were nice - shower was great.  Toiletries - very nice.   There is a general lack of outlets in the room. Television, for the size of the room, was small, but there were two tv's in our suite. There is also a bar area with fridge and cabinets with sink - - no stove though - and no microwave, so it's more for entertaining than preparing food or reheating food. Really beautiful room and breathtaking view.  I wish I had taken photos, but unfortunately, I forgot! If this hotel were located centrally within ""playing distance"", I'd give it a 5-star hands down, but solely for its location -  I can't give it the full 5-stars.  4.5 stars it is.",4,1,2,1,N,uOqh11i95vvIb_JI9apGUg,Terra Retra L.,"Frankfort, IL",October 2007,24,53,9,32,10,9,4,13,0,0.029009304871373837,53KFlNeOySbFmSMl1CgAQQ,Primo Passo Coffee,"Primo Passo Coffee - Santa Monica - Santa Monica, CA",53,3.5,"Restaurants, Cafes, Food, Coffee & Tea, METADATA","702 Montana Ave Santa Monica, CA 90403 Neighborhood: Santa Monica",Yes,$,No,http://www.primopassocoffee.com,(310) 451-5900,0

Thankfully I ended my stay in Chicago with the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place.  I've learned that I can depend on them for great amenities and customer service.  I'll look forward to staying at another one in the future.",4,1,1,0,N,y_396J28M_dTH3-sen2DVQ,Linda V.,"Chicago, IL",December 2008,51,20,0,16,2,0,3,0,1,0.014285714285714285,FKCgnpYf0mFsMHnZCe-i-g,Menchie's,"Menchie's - Santa Monica - Santa Monica, CA",68,3.0,"Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, METADATA","732 Montana Ave Santa Monica, CA 90403 Neighborhood: Santa Monica",Yes,$,None,http://menchies.com,(310) 393-4242,0

The staff is always friendly and I often get upgraded to nicer rooms. The location is prime because I hop on the public bus (stop is right in front of the hotel) and I am downtown in 10-15 minutes for a few bucks without having to pay for a cab. I have stayed here to attend a conference and it was well orchestrated with ample meeting space for the events. During non-conference trips I have enjoyed their great gym and sauna (seriously, quite nice) for some healthy relaxation. The gym is not huge but it is well equipped with everything you need (all top of the line). I haven't checked out the pool yet, but it seems serviceable. Some have complained about non-comfy beds, but mine have always been great. Once or twice I was stuck on a lower floor on the ""bad"" side of the tower, but usually I get a room with sweeping views of downtown Chicago or the lake. Regarding cleanliness -- I have yet to have a single bedbug scare and I have been staying here on and off for two years now. Most rooms are well kept, occasionally you get stuck in one with some old or uncared furniture but usually not. Soundproofing sometimes leaves a bit to be desired and depending on where you are you can hear hallway noise or noise from adjacent rooms, but it usually is nothing overwhelming and typical of what you would find at any hotel. Price-wise, I often get a good deal staying here (usually around $120-145 a night) which I think is great for a place with so many amenities and good service. Room service can be hit or miss, but I do make sure to always order breakfast as it's consistently delicious. You have to pay for internet which sucks but it's not too pricey. Once when I was there, I had a work emergency and needed to print and fax asap. I used their facilities on sight and got everything I needed in a timely way -- the downside was it was pricey -- I think it cost me $50+ to print maybe 10 pages and fax 10 pages.

It is close to the Midway Airport.  The Orange line cost $2 but once you get out on Roosevelt Ave, there isn't much cabs in that neighborhood, so you can walk 12-15 blocks or wait for a bus.

613,1/3/2011,5nDhk0rUmJ8DfPIA42XonA,"Hmm...what can I say about this hotel? What Impressed Me: -Beautiful building (it's pretty tall and elegantly modern inside) -The doorman/valet combo at the main entrance -Four-star treatment by the hotel staff -Plenty of parking -Room design -The double sinks What Didn't Impress Me: -Parking fees (I know it's 4-star, but come onnnn...) -The beds -The view from the room -The location -The jacked up sink So here's the deal. This is a pretty nice hotel--I wouldn't rave and brag about it being 4-star because when I laid my head down to sleep every night, I still felt like I was sleeping in a 3 (or maaaybe 3.5)-star hotel room. My boyfriend and I won 2 nights here through Priceline for a holiday, so we understood that we really weren't in any position to complain about much. However, there were a couple of things that we THOUGHT would be expected, considering that we were still at a supposedly fancy place. 1. The walls are INCREDIBLY thin. If you stayed in that hotel with us that weekend, we could tell you everything that you did. We knew when you went to the bathroom. We knew when you showered. We knew when you fought and cussed out your drunk girlfriend in your hotel room THREE doors down for 2 hours. And we knew that your devilish 5-year-old did NOT want to take a bath, go eat breakfast, or do anything else that you politely asked them to do. Thank GOD nobody around us got laid that weekend (although they probably didn't feel the same way lol) Minus half a star for you! 2. I appreciate the plethora of parking...especially since the hotel is in a major city. But when that doorman told us that daily parking was $33 and valet was $45, we almost had a heart attack. lol Guess that's how yall roll at these fancy schmancy hotels! We didn't complain or anything, but thirty dollars?! lol I guess that's more of a heads up for everyone.  No stars lost, but you get a warning. 3. O.M.G. You'd think that some of the money they're milking out of everyone would go towards the beds, considering that that's really what you're paying for. I know hotels aren't really using real boxsprings anymore, but the things that these mattresses were resting on were horrible! They made noises every time you sat on them.  And the mattresses were just outright uncomfortable. They were cheap, wherever they got them from. We actually spent the next 2 nights at a run-of-the-mill Marriott in Detroit, and their beds--amazing! Felt like I was in a 4-star bed...kinda how I THOUGHT I was going to feel when I slept here. This alone made me want to never stay at this hotel again. Yes, I understand you pay for the name when you stay at these kind of hotels, but I mean, a bed is a STANDARD luxury. If you're going to act like you're a luxury hotel, get a luxury bed! Or at least one that you can sleep in (not ON, in!) Great big fail on this front, guys. Minus one star. 4. I had a sink that took forever to process. lol It kind of annoyed me! You'd think this could be easily fixed with some Drain-o--why don't the housekeepers make note of this kind of stuff, anyway? Not a big deal, but it urked me. Good thing we had two sinks to work from. No points lost here. 5. All in all, it's a beautiful hotel. The decor inside is amazing, and the restaurants looked lovely (we chose to eat inside the city instead of splurging on hotel food). And you'd think with it being as tall as it is, the views would be better, but from our room, it really wasn't much. Maybe it's better from some of the other rooms. Doesn't help that it's not in the best part of Chicago--don't worry, you're not in the hood by any means, but you're definitely not in the thriving bustle of the city. I'll give half a star for trying, I guess. So there you have it! Four star on paper, three star in reality. Will I stay there again? Not if I have a choice! Would I recommend staying there? Only if you have to, or if you're like us, and happened to win it somehow.

626,7/15/2010,DYxl,"Chose this hotel for price/location. This is a older city hotel- rooms are smaller than you might be accustomed to. That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the ""El"" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems.

This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk.

You see it in the smallest ways.  The front desk clerk coming from behind the counter to personally hand you your key.  The doorman who runs back to your valet parked car to grab a bag you forgot and then brings it to the meeting room you are in.  The staff cleaning the public restrooms who greets you when you enter and says good bye when you leave. All small gestures . . . .but gestures that don't go unnoticed. The rooms are not as opulent as they might have once seemed as other chains have picked up their game but they are nice.  Oh sure, the rooms are over sized, and have a bed with the best  pillows, linens and duvets but they don't feel ""over the top"" as I used to think Ritz hotels were.

634,3/2/2012,4zQT,"We had a lovely experience at the Ritz-Carlton Chicago. LOCATION:  Very conveniently located to major attractions, Michigan Ave, & Rush St. STAFF:  Haven't encountered one sour puss. Everyone from door man to front desk & concierege to housekeeping has been perfectly pleasant and acccomodating. QUIRKS:  You take one set of elevators from street level to the lobby (12th floor). You take a different set of elevators from the lobby (12th floor) up to the guest rooms. And a third elevator takes you from the lobby down to the next level (11th floor) where the pool, exercise room and spa are located. The pool is one of the only amenities that appears in need of a renovation. It seems dark, uninviting and a throw-back to hotel pools of yesteryear. After a day of sightseeing and shopping, we mistakenly thought we'd chill poolside, take a dip, enjoy a beverage (avec tiny paper umbrella) and read a book. To our dismay, the room was dark and cavelike, the seating was sparse, and the pool was roped off into 4 lanes making it more of a lap pool than a place to unwind. And, there was no tiki bar. ROOM:  Quite comfortable. Large window across far end of room looks out over city. Comfortable couch. Spacious dresser with in-room safe and plenty of drawer space. Comfortable bed, soft linens. Two night stands. Stylish furnishing - not too edgy and not too ""starving artists sale out at the airport."" Nice sized flat screen TV on swivel stand on dresser. Large desk with office chair. Plenty of lighting and lamps. Nice sized closet with plenty of hangers. Separate bar/fridge area. BATH:  Spacious. Double sinks/vanities. Separate room with toilet and shower. 2 robes and 2 slippers provided for use during stay. Towels soft but still confident in structure and oversized. L'OCCITANE products including: 3 bar soaps, hand lotion, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner. Small canister on vanity with cotton balls, cotton pads and Q-tips).  Bath mats in front of toilet/shower and in front of sinks. Hair dryer. OTHER:   A little bar appears in the morning near the front desk area in the lobby with coffee, tea, espresso and a small assortment of pastries. It's adjacent to the hotel's business center, where I sit at this moment, composing this review. It's open 24 hours/day and offers a Mac and two PCs for guests' use.

From the valet's perfectly tailored clothing to the decor with not a smidgen of dirt to be found anywhere, this Ritz puts on the Ritz in their own hotel. I must admit, I felt a little grungy when I was a guest here at the Ritz and I'm far from a grungy person. But even wearing sundresses and pants with nice tops didn't seem to be quite elegant enough for the Ritz. Had I known, I would have packed my pearls and worn tailored dresses the whole time. That's what everyone else was wearing at least. The men were in suits or should I say, ""casual suits"" during the day and the women were in the same. We were about 30 years younger than any other guest at the Ritz so maybe that's why we got so many looks. But attitudes and guest attire aside, this hotel is spectacular. The lobby is on the 12th floor of the Water Tower so don't let the street entrance fool you. That's just a precursor to the glory. You exit the first group of elevators and enter a majestic setting of floor to ceiling windows and a huge lobby, lounge and restaurant overlooking the city of Chicago with the first view being of the Hancock building. Plus, don't forget about the Roman-like fountain placed perfectly in the center of the lobby. The rooms are just as magical as the lobby. Everything is clean. Everything is quiet. I didn't hear one peep from one guest or staffer my entire stay. It's like you enter into your own little royal world when you stay in a room at the Ritz. Some highlights include: - The beds. Oh heaven...the beds. I could have slept my way through vacation but the city of Chicago deserves more from me. - The bath products. They provide L'Occitane products in the bathrooms. Splendid. - The service. Completely perfect and professional from the minute of check-in to check out and this includes the run in with the maids and the valet giving me an umbrella when it started to rain. Some tips: If you are looking for five star service, in a five star setting, in the heart of Chicago, you can't do much better than the Ritz. Be sure to find time to sit in the lounge/bar area overlooking the city for a drink and if you are there on Sunday and have the time and funds, enjoy the Sunday brunch. I didn't eat it, but the smells and appearance told me it's worth every penny! So goodbye Ritz, until hopefully one day when I can visit again.

I certainly made that true when I began working in journalism and running around Springfield and Chicaboomboomwow town at 14 for work. Was it all due to this experience?

Bad: - Those strawberries I mentioned came with a card from a husband written to his wife.  I'm a guy, and not this husbands wife!  It was a mistake made by the hotel staff and completely unacceptable. - The elevators... there needs to be WAY more of them.  I swear I waited over 10 min. twice for an elevator.  Also, you have to go through two elevators just to get to the hotel floor you're staying on.  That's really annoying, especially since they take forever to arrive and aren't very quick to ascend/descend the floors.  Plus the elevators looked old and shabby with tacky gold stuff everywhere. - The bed was so soft, I literally awoke sunk over an inch into the matress.  I think the matress was covered with that foam stuff.  Whatever it was, it was way too soft! - The hotel staff evidently went into my room at least once a day for no real reason.  The room would have the same mess I left, but the TV would be turned and left on, playing classical music.  I don't want to walk into my room to see an energy-sucking TV playing classical music with a black screen noting only the channel number via crappy TV speakers.  That was absolutely ridiculous.  If they want to freak me out by turning music on when I didn't leave it on, they can go ahead and use the little clock stereo they include in the room!!! - Parking was ridiculously expensive and I had to use valet to park.  I don't like it when people drive my car.  It's not your regular car and it's a stick shift.  No reason for me to have to have someone else park my car... no reason at all. - Here's the kicker... a week later I needed a copy of my receipt because I lost the original.  I called and was directed to accounting.  I was asked to hold.  Then I was told I had to fax in a written request.  Excuse me?  (1) This is 2010... get an online site where I can just download a PDF of my receipt like you can do with even Motel 6 and (2) No other hotel I've ever encountered requires a written request!

Fast forward to this evening.  Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume.  On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property.  This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again?  Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill.  Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.",1,1,0,0,N,y7yK2KDb_C_xG-RBpVpslA,Jessica The Displaced New Yorker K.,"Boston, MA",October 2008,159,341,28,261,125,98,163,21,13,0.23340177960301164,GwiXZq92Kuadl8F8MByKkg,O'Shucks Bar & Grill,"O'Shucks Bar & Grill - Park City, UT",29,3.5,"Restaurants, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Bars, METADATA","427 Main Park City, UT 84060",Yes,$,None,None,(435) 645-3999,0

Pros:  great location, close to everything.  A historical landmark, and right across the street from from the Drake Hotel, an even more historical Chicago landmark.  Room size is average for a downtown hotel, which means ""not very big"" - but the bed was comfortable and bathroom was nicely decorated with modern fixtures. Cons:  in the hotel's attempt to be eco-friendly, they installed modern, low-water-consumption toilets that aren't powerful enough to flush anything down but liquids - I had to call an engineer to plunge the toilet when we checked in.  Also, there was some evidence of yellowish-brown crud in the corners of the bathroom (gross).  The shower was another issue - they installed a nice ceiling mounted shower head as well as a handheld nozzle, but the shower itself (no bathtub) is very small and the glass door opens INWARD, so when you turn on the shower you either get shocked by cold water coming down from the ceiling, or you drench the door and bathroom floor if you choose to turn the shower on first and let it warm up.  Not a very smart layout. Additionally, if you have a car, valet parking is mandatory at $53/day (there's no self-parking) but that's downtown parking for you.  On the plus side, the valets are very friendly and pleasant, and are very prompt with retrieving your car when you call down for it.",3,2,0,1,N,Z67X9Lc_SZ5tzxqjm-acww,Madison Freshly Ground C.,"New York, NY",May 2010,10,135,6,150,73,45,48,5,1,0.15271493212669685,neZ_JPRgO-2UgUlndMNa3Q,Red Circle Inn & Bistro,"Red Circle Inn & Bistro - Nashotah, WI",7,4.0,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Steakhouses, METADATA","N44W33013 Watertown Plank Rd Nashotah, WI 53058",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.redcircleinn.com,(262) 367-4883,0

707,12/17/2011,9PbPu307TpgsZhXt34LdEQ,Omni Hotel was the site of our committee meeting. We have volunteers fly in from across the US so my review is not only of the meeting room space and service but also on the hotel rooms...or at least mine. The Meeting Space: Just fine as far as meeting rooms go. It was clean. The A/V peeps were available to help us with any issues we were having (which not many). The space was set up bright and early every morning for our meetings. The food for the meetings was pretty decent. You know how hotel meeting food can be. They put on quite the spread for our lunch service and we were quite pleased. The banquet and meetings staff were extremely helpful and even loaded up our A/V equipment and other valuables to be locked up with security so we didn't have to lug it back to our rooms. They took care of it all for us without a hitch! The Hotel: Omni is a very nice hotel. It's in a great location for a meeting or a weekend away. It's a little confusing though as the lobby is on the third floor and you have to take different elevators to get to the lobby or meeting spaces vs. the elevators for the rooms. I'm not a fan of this set up but it's not the end of the end of the world or anything.   The Rooms: This is an all suites hotel. I appreciate having a separate living area. My room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room itself was spacious and they have a nice turn down service. Our volunteers were quite happy with the rooms as well. I would not hesitate to stay here on my own accord and I would most definitely book another meeting here. Some of our volunteers stayed the weekend after our meeting was over to enjoy what Chicago has to offers.

710,1/16/2009,h8ojJrL7UdTFmo,"Oh, Omni, I expected more from you.  I stayed here for 5 nights and was satisfied with most of what I saw, but not wowed.  The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on in a hotel.  What staff I interacted with were very polite and friendly.  Plenty of channels on the TV.  Valets were prompt and helpful, but parking was a little more expensive ($49/day) than most of the other hotels I researched in planning this trip.  Location is great, close to plenty of shops and restaurants as well as an El stop (red line).  And they take the government rate, which is always a plus in my book. However.  Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel.  Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program.  If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine.  However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect.  I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to ""keep trying.""  I usually had to ""keep trying"" until the next day.  To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush.  I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, ""leftovers,"" no matter what I was flushing.  As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe.

All in all, we'd likely stay there again if we couldn't find comparable within 2 blocks or so just because of the location but improving some of those things would be a surefire way to get our repeat business. Before you go, sign up for their free Omni Select Guest program and you'll get free wifi in your room instead of a $10 daily charge.  You'll also get 2 complimentary beverages per person for up to 2 people in the morning.  We got real used to hot cocoa and OJ for breakfast.  They were always right on time.  They also give you these weird little shots of some kind of smoothie that my hubby loved but I thought smelled like clay so I wasn't touchin' that stuff!  So the free program was MORE than worth it!  We also got the parking included package which I think runs between $179-$229 at the time of reviewing depending on the time of year you book.  (We paid the high end because we were there at Christmas)  It was really nice to not have to worry about self parking and we only used the car one time while there and all was well with the car.  No extra miles put on the car ala Ferris Bueller!",4,1,1,0,N,ZKHpDDP3KJf-2WVzsyGyUg,liz C-note d.,"Chicago, IL",February 2008,23,351,16,301,204,151,80,0,0,0.20598591549295775,reLS8pbNCczOc0jDp5XIKA,Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & Tea Room,"Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & Tea Room - Downtown Ann Arbor - Ann Arbor, MI",47,4.5,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Shopping, Books, Mags, Music and Video, Bookstores, METADATA","114 S Main St Ann Arbor, MI 48104 Neighborhood: Downtown Ann Arbor",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.crazywisdom.net,(734) 665-2757,0

I have driven, and walked by Hotel 71 countless times- and somehow I always got the impression that it was an outdated hotel in a great location. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. I had a Groupon to stay at Hotel 71 for less than $100 a night. Quite the feat for this part of town. Given that the rate was so low- I chose to upgrade to one of their King River View Rooms for a few more dollars. An excellent choice as my room was on the 12th floor- and looked right down the Chicago River, and all its bridges- a beautiful view day or night. When I arrived at the hotel- the valet took my car ( a little pricey at $43 but in line with other places in the area) and I walked up to the front desk. The front desk clerk was welcoming and pleasant and had no issue in dealing with my Groupon or the special request that I had of him. You see- I was staying in town to go to a concert and I had a couple of tickets I was leaving for friends at the front desk. Given the value of the tickets and the fact that the concert was that night- there was little margin for error. He said it wouldn't be a problem, they do it all the time and he was right. My friends picked up the tickets with no problem. Nice. My room was large with a plush king sized bed with tons of pillows. The bathroom was also large and came with only a shower- no tub. The amenities were similar to a mid range hotel- nice but not luxurious. The towels functional but not sumptuous. The toiletries fine but not high end. But all in all a good deal for the money all the way around. If you want something to eat there is a cafe on the ground floor and of course room service. All it seemed to be lacking to me was a bar area where I could have had a drink while waiting on a friend of mine. But since the weather was so fine- I wandered across the river and had a few outside at Smith and Wollensky instead. Check out was seamless. The valet brought my car out in less than 5 minutes and I was on my way. But not before thinking was a great deal this hotel is- right in the heart of the city!",4,5,3,1,N,yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ,Meredith Meremaid B.,"Chicago, IL",March 2009,115,516,15,944,373,184,156,6,12,0.3938931297709924,g6XZNMrtPG8mxpoFrL5b1w,Starbucks,"Starbucks - Downtown Ann Arbor - Ann Arbor, MI",10,3.0,"Food, Coffee & Tea, METADATA","300 S Main Ann Arbor, MI 48104 Neighborhood: Downtown Ann Arbor",Yes,$$,Free,http://starbucks.com,(734) 222-9046,0
746,8/27/2007,CjiGxBPkKUREBomUtr18dw,"Is it wrong to give a hotel 2 stars based mostly on the elevators? I just can't justify 3, although to be fair I guess this should be more like a 2.5, because the room my parents stayed in was nice and pretty big, with a great view. But honestly, with the amount of money they have got to be making, they REALLY need to invest some time and energy into renovating their elevators. First of all, if you can get on an elevator in under five minutes from the time you push the button, congratulations to you! The elevator never, ever, ever came quickly, whether we had called it from the ground floor or the floor my parents were staying on. Even though they have the floors separated into sections, and a couple elevators per section, it doesn't help. One time my mom walked all the way to the end of the hall back to their room, let herself in, and got something she had forgotten -- and this was AFTER we'd already waited 2 or 3 minutes for the elevator -- and when she got back we STILL had another 1 or 2 minutes before the elevator arrived. Second of all, the elevator is S-L-O-W SLOW. I guess this goes without saying, considering how long it takes to arrive at whatever floor you're on, but oh my goodness, it's even more painfully slow than you'd imagine it would be while you're waiting for it. Pretty much every time we rode the elevator DOWN, it stopped at every single floor, and it quickly filled up (because, oh, did I mention the elevators are also pretty small? Cuz they are.) and so the first few people would be able to get on, but by the 3rd stop or so, we'd just be met with exasperated faces and rolling eyes every time the door opened and whoever was waiting for the elevator realized they'd have to wait for yet ANOTHER ten minutes for the next elevator and hope that it wasn't full. Honestly, I can't imagine staying on the mid-range floors, how did they ever get downstairs?! It honestly would have been faster to walk. And the whole experience wasn't MUCH more pleasant for those of us ON the elevator, either, considering how much longer it took to get downstairs. And, last but not least, the elevators are pretty terrifying. I don't know how old they are but I'm going to guess PRETTY DAMN OLD.

751,1/8/2010,o-Tl6stpiVsly6bRmR,"I stayed in Hotel71 for two weeks over the holidays, and it turned out to be a pretty nice place. My boyfriend and I booked the queen double room with a city view. We chose the double room because it was considerably larger than the single bed rooms and was almost the same price on http://hotels.com. Our room came with two beds, a desk area, a chaise lounge, and a two-part bathroom (one room held the marbled sinks and mirrors, while the adjoining room had the rain shower and bathtub). Our room had plenty of storage space, a huge closet, and plenty of cabinets and drawers to store our belongings. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We requested a mini fridge and microwave, which were both placed in our room by the time we checked in. The gym in the hotel is very nice with a ton of different machines. The gym also has an amazing view of the city, definitely a bonus while working out. My only complaints have to do with the cable and phone service in the hotel. The cable had a VERY limited amount of channels, about 20. If you're visiting the city for the first time, this won't be a problem since I assume you'll want to go out and about in Chicago and not sit in the hotel and watch tv., but since I am native to the city and stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks, I definitely had down time in the hotel. The no tv. situation was a big letdown for me. Lastly, the biggest problem we experienced was the phone service. The area code for downtown Chicago is 312, while the rest of Chicago is 773. We made a few phone calls to 773 numbers, believing that they would be considered ""local"" and thus be free. This is not the case, upon check out we were handed a bill for over $80 in phone charges. We checked everywhere in the room and welcome book, NOWHERE does it say anything about exorbitant charges for phone service. We called the front desk and explained that they should have posted somewhere about the fees and that we felt misled. They gave us a $40 credit and apologized, blamed the fees on some new phone provider that they are switching to. The credit was ok, but I definitely still feel taken advantage of.

The views of the river were spectacular, and the interior was extremely well appointed, with the exception of a small couch which didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the plush decorations. A few knocks were a gigantic walk in closet which really would serve no purpose unless and extremely compulsive packer stayed here. And the lack of a fridge or ice machine, maybe it was best there wasn't a mini-bar, but c'mon, the beer was getting warm. Did we deserve a place this nice?

The internet didn't work and the bathroom looked a little worn (toilet made noises and the shower looked outdated). I called to complain about the internet connection so they moved me right away to a different room. The new room was the jackpot. Pros: - free internet - VERY spacious room and even more spacious bathroom - the bathroom was the cleanest and most modernized bathrooms I've seen that wasn't in a 5 star hotel (there was a flat screen in the bathroom). - good location. I was able to walk to most anywhere I needed to go along State St and Mich.

I got here on a Friday afternoon and much to my surprise the Hotel was actually awaiting my arrival - many hotels I have been to here have always had me waiting for my room to be ""ready."" It was clean and very contemporary yet dark in the lobby. The bellhop was awesome although he gave me a heads up on the slow elevators I was extremely shocked to wait literally 8 minutes for the ONE elevator to SLLLLOOOWWWWLLYYY come down to take us up to the room. The elevator itself took away alot of our motivation out that weekend when deciding where and when we were going anywhere. The room, checking in everything was as pictured however I did for some odd reason think that paying 249.00 a night would have gotten me a little more square footage especially since I upgraded the room to a River View. It really made me wonder what a ""normal"" room size was. The best was the view and the bathroom! I loved it. However by Saturday morning we were callling the front desk thirty times about housekeeping coming to atleast remake the beds and bring tissue to the room! I mean we left that morning at 9:00am and came back at 7:00pm to find our room just as we had left it and without any TISSUE! do you know how frustrating it is to have your body wait for tissue! Although the experience wasn't as great as I wished it would have been considering the very large bill I had to flip, there were little things like the location, valet/parking and view  that earned the stars Edit**** I forgot the convenient bar downstairs in the lounge area....its an hotel employee but they have all the alcohol you can take, you can drink in the lounge and watch the flat screen or take the drinks up to your room!

Make sure to ask the hotel staff about Windella river cruises, which are a stones throw away from the location.

I have however deducted stars for two reasons. 1) they no longer serve adequate room service (my first trip they had this wonderful lox served on wafer-thin bagels that I am yet to locate in any health food store) and 2) my last trip they put me in the wrong room and then transferred me to a small Premiere room that was nothing near what I had come to expect for the same price. Repetition is required for excellence in my book. I want to state that I fully intend to try this hotel again and update my score if it improves since my first visit was so memorable for me.

800,8/9/2011,GNgKlxhnFR6OirA,"This hotel was the perfect start to our mini-vacation: a long weekend in Chicago.  The location is awesome, right in the loop so super close to any line of the El train.  Also was within walking distance of all the restaurants I had chosen.   Everything from walking in and having someone jump up to hold the doors for us, to the grand staircase as we entered, to the super funky décor of the lobby told us that this was going to be an experience in itself.  Little did we know... I had done my research ahead of time to know that not only does the hotel offer a free wine reception every evening (sweet!), but they also have a ""code word"" that you can use to get a special surprise when you check in.  I was expecting a $10 voucher for the restaurant, or something of that scale.  What we actually received was a king suite on the top floor of the hotel.  I think that's the biggest hotel room I've ever been in.  Our jaws dropped as we entered and began to look around.  I crossed the room to the bathroom where I saw that we had a Jacuzzi tub!  I called out to my boyfriend to tell him, only to find out that he was also checking out a bathroom.  For those not keeping up, we had two bathrooms.  Man did I ever feel pampered!   The décor in the room was awesome too.  Definitely nothing like what I would do in my own home, but I loved the funky design of the wallpaper and the blue picture of a cello.  It was so nice that we didn't even mind when I got heat exhaustion and spent the second half of Sunday in the room!  We ordered delivery from Lou Malnati's and relaxed. My only complaint is that the walls were pretty thin, so we could hear the tv in the bordering rooms sometimes, but it didn't really bother us at all.  Also, for at least one day two of the three elevators were out of commission, but they worked on that fairly quickly, and allowed us to use the service elevators in the meantime.  Honestly, everything else was so amazing that I'm going to give it a 5 star rating anyways! All in all, I loved this hotel, and would definitely stay there again.  Thanks for an awesome weekend Kimpton!",5,6,6,0,N,ZBo6qleidHe4-y9wONquAQ,s. l.,"Berkeley, CA",August 2011,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.00468384074941452,H8d0V1p49mW65jHwJBmONg,G-Zen Restaurant,"G-Zen Restaurant - Branford, CT",14,4.0,"Restaurants, Vegan, Vegetarian, METADATA","2 E Main St Branford, CT 06405",Yes,$$,No,http://www.g-zen.com/,(203) 208-0443,0

We haven't had such luck with the services promised for people with pets. At the Hotel Monaco (April 2011)  we checked in late, but not before grilling the phone operator about having pet sitting available for the next day (and booking it). We mentioned it again at check-in and were reassured that all we needed to do was check in with the concierge in the morning. Lo and behold, the concierge gave us one of those looks that the Maitre D' gives Ferris Bueller - raised eyebrow, corners of mouth turned down....Snooty? Snotty! He had no idea. Nothing was booked, and nothing could be on short notice. I love the pet friendly vibe of the Allegro - but we ended up boarding our dog at a nearby place for the night. The pet-sitting service the concierge put us in touch with (Puppy Love) were helpful and accomodating in booking the times we required, but at a price of $360! 2 x 4 hour blocks for $360.

My only real complaint was that when checking in, the front desk person (not Katie) steered us towards breakfast at the attached restaurant (312), and sort of mixed it in with all the complimentary services offered by the hotel (coffee in the morning, wine hour in the late afternoon, etc), so it sort of made it seem like breakfast was complimentary too.

It isn't a bad spot for a romantic getaway, and since it's possible to hear your neighbors (and vice-versa) hilarity can ensue depending on how mischievous you are. Right in Chicago's theater district, you're conveniently near a Metro stop connecting to many lines, including tourist stops and O'Hare International. The location isn't ideal for breakfast as there are too many chain eateries nearby, and the non-chains aren't open early enough. The lobby and lounge is attractive (dig the eclectic wallpaper), and their happy hour special provides free wine - yes, gratis - to guests from 5 to 6 PM, giving one a chance to mingle, or simply unwind solo. (Besides happy hour vino, we scoured small, pricey bottles of Belvedere from our minibar.) After realizing our dinner plans were a bit unrealistic, a concierge stationed in the lobby (Mark) helpfully found us another place, secured a reservation, and provided us with handy directions. Loved our room's decent view, modern decor, and amenities, like dreamy soft beds, an iPod charger/alarm clock (perfect for having an impromptu party like we did), and a huge flat screen TV - the bathroom's glam, marble counter topped with Aveda products was a nice touch too.

806,10/6/2009,xpR9XVlt5OwKCkZoQOkmQQ,"The Hotel Allegro should have been a five star experience. I mean, what's not to like about a hotel in downtown Chicago, close to everything, especially the theater district, that offers impeccable service in a contemporary environment? Read on, I say. It had been a long day and while I rarely stay in the city since I live here- I was treating my team to a little outing and they wanted to stay in the city so who am I to say no? Due to other commitments, I got to the hotel late and checked in. The lobby is up one level from the street and is decorated in a fun and contemporary way. Know that Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly so I had to maneuver my way around a couple of dogs that had made themselves at home in the front lobby. The desk clerk checked me in quickly and I was in my room moments later. I loved the room layout. I had a corner room with lots of windows, plush pillows on the bed, and a comfy chair. The bed was turned down, the radio on and as I was unpacking my bag I spied two animal print robes in the closet. Rrrrrrrrrrrr! I slipped into one and nibbled a bit on the basket of fruit and cheese that had been sent to the room. Wanting to have a glass of wine to go with it- I went over to the mini bar. It was at this point that I noticed that my mini bar key was broken and no amount of ""finagling"" on my part would open the door. Oh well. I didn't need that wine anyway is what my rational side was saying. My emotional side? Was already whining about no wine! As I settled in for bed- it seemed like a good idea to use the bathroom before I turned in. Imagine my surprise when I flushed and all the water came up instead of going down. Urrgh! Made me think about who the heck was in the room before me? I called down to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer up right away. Oh great. Here I am in my cute leopard print robe. That would never do for a ""visitor"". So I got dressed again to await the man with the steel snake (Trust me. That sounds more interesting than it was!) Other than those two issues and valet parking that was a third of the cost of the room ($48- can you believe that for one night? $42 if you park it yourself) my stay was perfect. Complimentary coffee brought up in the morning, Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, plush towels, chocolates, free wireless, flat screen TV's, everything that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. And the price was right. You can get a negotiated rate of about $150 - $190 per night which is cheap for this part of town. Would I recommend it? You betcha.

807,6/9/2008,EiO8OvO1Ts5V2uIp172SqA,"Ah, the Allegro.  Filled with pros and cons.  The location is pretty decent (although I do hate that pretty much everything in the Loop is closed on weekends.  Come on, Lavazza, work with me here!!).  The lobby decor is definitely more swank than wank.  Apparently there's free wine in the evenings (which I missed, but turns out the glasses are teeny-tiny, so no big loss, I guess).  But the rooms.  Are SO.  SO.  TINY.  Like, maybe even tinier than the wine glasses.  Granted, we crammed four people into a room with two double beds--certainly fun times, but it was like a clown car.  Four people, four suitcases, two beds in a tiny room and a minuscule bathroom (but with Aveda products, woot) makes for a very cramped weekend.  Once I climbed over everyone and their stuff into bed, though, I very much enjoyed the fluffy pillows and cozy bed linens. We attended a wedding at the Allegro, so I can also comment on their event capacity.  The Walnut Room is a nice space for a smaller ceremony, although very dim (maybe that was just this wedding?  I dunno--none of my photos turned out), and the staff is quick to flip the room for dinner and dancing.  Plenty of room for tables, a stage for the band and a dance floor.  I'm assuming the hotel catered the meal, which was good (although I'd pass on the pasta course or be very clear with the kitchen that the pasta should be al dente).  The servers were very inconspicuous and efficient, although maybe too efficient... I'm pretty sure someone swiped my champagne before I had a chance to drink it and I don't think I was being cut off... My last issue is with the baggage check folks.  My husband was given a framed poster as a groomsmen gift which we couldn't haul on the plane home with us.  We arranged to have a city-dwelling friend pick up the poster from the baggage check and we'd pick it up the next time we drove up to Chicago.  The folks at the Allegro were fine with this arrangement, which was a relief.  After Laura B.'s third attempt to retrieve this framed poster from countless clueless baggage check people, Justin had to call the Manager to make sure they still had the item.  They did and it was finally handed over to our friend, but not after numerous wasted trips on her part.  Boo to the baggage people; five stars for Laura for being a great friend and babysitting the poster for us. :)",3,4,4,4,N,wGGdj_gh-wwejcYmjf_tbw,Jon Mata Mata W.,"Washington, DC",June 2007,114,301,47,726,489,171,354,109,7,0.15443817342226782,bx_OTEssaL8N9JO-HhWWgA,Pilates of Stamford,"Pilates of Stamford - Stamford, CT",1,4.0,"Education, Active Life, Fitness & Instruction, Trainers, METADATA","9 High Ridge Rd Stamford, CT 06905",None,None,None,http://www.pilatesofstamford.com,(203) 967-9494,0

The sink was so small, that you could probably fit like 2 bottles of something and that is all the vanity space you have. Literally if I was on the toilet, I could reach over on the right and wash my hands in the sink or I could take 1 step over to the left and I'd be in the bathtub. Very small bathroom. With all the space in the room, they should really think about making the bathroom just a tad bigger. Bed was a little springy, but it wasn't bad. The comforter was really thin though.

My husband breezed through check-in while I sat in awe of the lobby (if they the movie ""Cool World"" was redone for this decade - this lobby would be in it). I'm sure the rooms vary in size, but we got a huge corner one with enough room for me to do if a flip flop ( I would assume if I were a gymnast). The room had the usual modern updates - iPod clock radio, plasma TV, soft robes, etc, sleek furniture and decor. I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!)

I had originally reserved at Hotel Burnham but due to a snafu on their part, they had to send me over to Hotel Allegro. So, into a cab I go for yet another leg of my journey (it was so close I could have walked easily but I didn't argue when cab fare was shoved in my hand.) I was a little annoyed at the change but all that was gone when I walked into the lobby. Hell-o there, gorgeous! If you've ever stayed in a Kimpton, you can expect business as usual here. Free wine in the evenings, ultra cool, plush, and fashionable digs, the best in technology (iHome, free wireless, HD flat screens), mostly helpful and pleasant staff, and room service orders you regret in the morning. I also really like their pens. They rank up there with Yelpstick as being an all time favorite tschotske. Highlights: - lucked out with a crazy huge room, super clean, very comfortable, and quiet - one bell hop in particular was a ray of sunshine and was supremely helpful with bags and directions - animal print robes for sassy relaxation times (see photo ;) Lowlights: - the other hotel sent over a bottle of wine for their mistake (how'd they know I'm easily placated with alcohol?) and I didn't have the minibar key to access a corkscrew. I called down to have it brought up and it never showed so I eventually had to go down myself. - valet parking is exorbitant (no self park) and other options in the area are nearly as bad. Best to leave the car out of it or plan for paying that much. - front desk staff can be a leeetle bit snooty. I paid $100 (with a lil help from my friend Mr. Shatner) and with taxes it was around $128 for a Friday night stay.

Another con is the location - it's not really close to anything but the theaters - for the price, you'd be better off staying in a much more central location.   One more con - our suite was supposed to have a ""two-person jacuzzi"" - it was just a bathtub with some extra spray-jet things.  Bogus!  Only two very small children could fit in there comfortably.

The manager on duty was terrific and extremely helpful. Since the hotel was not fully booked, it was no problem checking in at 8 am with no extra charge. Now, that's a service!  To top it all off, she did a research before we arrived and gave us a list of flower shops, in case we want to get some flowers for our friend in the hospital.

First of all, Hotel Allegro was super convenient, just a few blocks away from the blue line stop where our tired, weary feet emerged late the night of our arrival. The neon blue sign for the hotel was never more welcoming at that moment! The staff were also really helpful, friendly, and courteous and gave us some good recommendations of a place that would deliver to the hotel (it was really late and everything closes SO early in Chicago!). It was very convenient and easy to get to other places in the city from it, making excursions easy and convenient. My first impression of the room was that it was ridiculous. In a good way, mind you, but ridiculous nevertheless. Cream colored wallpaper with bright silver designs, a gigantic distressed glass mirror directly in front of the bed (hmm), which itself was pretty ridiculous with its blue velvet headboard and a large black bureau and minibar, with a huge flatscreen tv. Maybe I'm silly, but I really enjoyed the room. It was just ridiculous enough to be fun, and although all of the furniture took up most of the space, it was decorated loudly enough for a room twice its size. I didn't really mind the smallness of the bathroom either, although if we had been staying longer or for it might have gotten cramped. The bed was comfy, the thermostat adjusted the temperature of the room in a flash, and I felt like the room and bathroom were well cleaned before we arrived. The only bad thing was the room service. The guy who brought it up was pleasant and I guess I should have expected it to be expensive but I was NOT prepared to pay $28 for soggy, gross nachos without any salsa. We only ordered it because it was getting late and we were desperate but YIKES. For $28 they could at least make it a decent plate of nachos.

Typically I just stay at a Starwood to rack up the points, but my company has a new partnership with Kimpton Hotels so I thought I would try it. What a great alternative to the standard hotel. The service was amazing, even checking ahead of time to see what type of pillow I would like in my room and how many. I was plesantly greeted when I arrived, and went up to a nice sized, clean (although a little brightly colored) room. The beds were unbelievable comfortable and even though I typically have a very difficult time sleeping when traveling- I got a great night sleep. The best part about my stay was meeting a friend down in the hotel bar. We were going to go out, but due to cold weather we just decided to get a drink at the hotel. The brightly colored lounge played great music and had the feel of taking you to another era. The staff was friendly and martinis tasty and the whole atmosphere had the feel that you could walk up and sit with anyone in the bar and strike up a conversation. ADDITION Jan. 12, 2007: I just stayed again at this hotel... and here are some more things I love... the hotel is pet friendly (I didn't bring a pet) but I have recently learned that all Kimpton hotels seem to be pet friendly even the really upscale, expensive ones. They have a power strip next to the mirror so you don't have to climb under things and unplug lights to plug in your curling iron, they ask you what type of pillow you would like (it's the little things), and did I mention they have a complimentary wine hour after work... ADDITION: July 19, 2007- Just got back from my fourth trip to Chicago in the past 7 months and another stay at Allegro. Hotel was still great and remains one of my favorites, but this time I happened to be there on a weekend when it was 100% booked. I had never noticed the hotel being noisy before- but this time I had to call down to quiet down the room next to me (the hotel sent someone up right away and then they were quiet so it wasn't a big deal), but then on my fourth morning at the hotel a baby was crying at 5AM in the room next to me.

Its a hotel with a swanky, distinctive feel.  When I first walked in and saw the wide red staircase, I was convinced I'd gone to the wrong place.  The lobby fooled me into thinking I'd walked into a party room - so much so that I walked back downstairs, got in the elevator and pressed the lobby button, only to arrive back in the same place! My king room on the 14th floor wasn't a room you'd stretch out in, but it was fine by me.  The decor from the rest of the hotel followed me into the room, which was very comfortable and inviting.  The desk chair is great, with plenty of room to work on a laptop and spread things out.  The wide-screen HD television fits into the room nicely and, of course, has a great picture.  The bed sleeps well and the iPod compatible alarm clock is a nice feature. The room layout is funny - I've got two tiny closets, one complete with leopard print tank top and hot pants for purchase.  The bathroom is tiny at a glance, but just fine for your needs.  The vanity is long, so you don't feel cramped when laying out your toiletries.  They are still providing the Aveda products, as other reviewers have mentioned. The free wine hour is still going strong - not $100 bottle stuff, but it's the magic price - FREE.  I didn't try the morning coffee or the room service.  I took a peek in the mini-bar and found what I expect - airplane bottles with big price tags! I couldn't hear the ""L"" from my room, but I faced out over Randolph instead of Wells.  The plumbing noises didn't bother me much either - I think I heard the shower start up one morning out of 4.  The only noise that has been bothersome is that of the neighboring room raising their window shade - like mine, it takes a dozen pulls on a plastic chain that is a bit noisy.  Beautiful shade - poor mechanism. I'd definitely return to this hotel and it makes me curious aobut other Kimpton hotels.  I'd recommend this place to anyone - business or pleasure.  Its right around the corner from the Wells/Washington station on the ""L"" and the Clark/Lake subway station - so a train ride from either airport is very convenient.

I actually didn't mind the design clusterf*ck nearly as much as my boyfriend did, but I can see why it hurt his feelings: hot pink, gray, and gold couches with copper tables, and gray geometric wall paper? Please. You either have Special Needs or you're as mentally unstable as a serial killer if you picked that out and thought it looked good. And the service. Oooh gurl: Our reservation was through Priceline or some other 3rd party vendor - so even though we called to let them know we were showing up past Midnight and they assured us that they'd keep our room for us, when our flight was delayed and we showed up much later the room was gone. Fine, whatever, we get it - always book through the hotel. But then they promised to move our luggage for us into a bigger room with two beds, and we show up in the new room and of course they didn't move our stuff. So we call them to explain. Someone in our party had the old room key (which still worked, PS) so we grabbed our stuff ourselves cause it was taking too long, and then like three doormen came by the new room, letting us know our stuff wasn't in the old room, and we explained every time to each new person.

856,8/15/2012,JHFIpWXZ,"This visit was a follow-up to another trip in May 2012. I had some minor issues and hotel management contacted me and invited me to come back. I booked my room via the SPG website. I received an email from the concierge a week or so before my arrival, which was a nice change from last time. I didn't specifically tell them I was coming because I wanted to experience the hotel without thinking that they were treating me special because I complained once. Well, this time they gave me a lot more to complain about (and the issues were much more substantial than last time). It started when I had to wait 2 hours for my room despite requesting an earlier check-in. I totally understand that it's really them doing me a favor based on availability and clearly they were full this weekend. While I was waiting I had my luggage stored and then asked the concierge for help booking the Acura Experience. By the time my room was ready the Acura Experience was already full. I found out there was still some availability at the time I reached out to the concierge (and for about an hour afterward). Clearly she neglected to reach out on my behalf and I missed out. My room was finally ready and I gave the luggage guy my ticket to have it brought to my room. But for the fact that I was standing in line waiting to follow-up with the concierge, he would have given my suitcase to another guest. I saw him bring it to them and I purposely waited to intervene to see how he handled himself. When I finally said it was my bag the guest apologized, even though it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to do with the error. The luggage guy didn't say anything and I brought my bag upstairs myself. I really wanted to settle in quickly so I could get my trip started and start coordinating meeting friends. The employees continually reminded me that check-ins aren't guaranteed until 3:00 PM. I realize that, but it was disappointing especially since they knew about my request at least a week prior to my arrival. There were many other issues that came up and I'll save those specific details for management to address before adding them to a review.

This was my first stay at a W and I was pretty taken aback when I thought I had accidentally stumbled into some club. The heavy odor of cologne in the air, the obvious mood lighting, and the yuppie crowd with drinks in their hands made me feel like I had just missed the annual Chicago gigolo convention. They play clubbish music most of the time too, which makes me feel like I need to dance everywhere I go rather than just walk. Anyway, the staff is incredibly friendly and gracious, overbearingly so honestly. Everyone kept asking me ""how are you sir? Is everything OKAY??"" Dude, don't be so insecure, I'm cool. The room was fantastic, though I'm not used to inspirational messages on the walls of my hotels. Loved the bath products, though we often didn't have enough. As to why this goes to 3.5 stars ... well like I said the staff was a little overbearing at times. I like good service, but this had an aggressive air about it that made it feel fraudulent somehow. The cleaning staff was not the best. They seemed disorganized most of the time. We opted for the going green option (my lady is a massive point hoarder) but then they cleaned our room anyway, negating the points until we got it cleared by the concierge. Also, the first night we arrived our comforter had several brown stains on it. It looked like a chocolate bar had been rubbed across it ... at least I hope to God it was a chocolate bar ... I need to shower now. The gym was okay, but small and lacking some basic stuff. They have 4 machines: 3 for leg exercises and 1 unwieldy one for ""all those other body parts."" If fitness is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere. And this is just nitpicking, but I'm not a fan of how they have to be hipster with everything.

Some of the hilarity is purposeful (the extra roll of toilet paper in the room came in a tidy little bag labeled ""backup plan""), but other things are hilariously unintentional, like the SNL-worthy ribbed black turtlenecks all the lounge staff was wearing. Sometimes I wonder if the W takes itself a little too seriously while trying to be the ""anti-hotel"". While my suite was more than roomy enough and felt clean, spacious, and modern, I did notice that I could hear hall noises so clearly they felt like they were happening in my own room. I didn't hear any neighbor noises (maybe I didn't have neighbors?) but whenever someone was walking down the hall it sounded like my door was just standing open. Fitted black turtlenecks or not, the service was flawless. The W staff came through for me in two major ways. (1) I bought too many pairs of shoes and couldn't fit them into my suitcase, so they sent up a FedEx box and form, and took it away from me once I packed. That was huge! Saved me either extra baggage fees or having to tromp through Chicago crowds to find a post office. (2) My flight got cancelled and I was able to scoot back my checkout time until 1 pm, no questions asked, no additional charges. Speaking of charges, this place is a tad expensive (WiFi was outrageous... don't they know the young, hip crowd likes their internets?), but it was definitely on par with other hotels in the area. When you get to a major downtown location, I notice there isn't much variance in the room prices anyway.

The clerk said, ""Hey, we'll just get you one and bring it to your room!"" Just like that! And, they did, in 5 minutes! I of course returned it when I checked out.

871,12/15/2011,vvt9nBOqs3N9ThQOyzQg1Q,"So this is the hotel closest to my Firm's Chicago office, so I've stayed there many times. This past weekend motivated me to Yelp. I was 96 miles short of renewing Gold Medallion status on Delta, so I decided to take my wife to Chicago for her birthday to top it off. The W is right in the heart of the loop, and only a few blocks from my wife's favorite attraction, the Art Institute of Chicago. Also this is where she stayed last time we had a ""couple"" visit, two months before our first child was born, so I knew she liked it. Upon check-in they were extremely courteous (in part due to my Gold Starwood status), and when my wife mentioned it was her birthday, they not only gave us a room upgrade (offering the west side with more ambient sunlight, or the east side facing the courtyard with more quiet; Ed note: the west side faces the El, which is why the ""darker"" courtyard is quieter), but also offered us a selection of wine/cheese/fruit options. She chose champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Upon returning from our touristing that day, the chilled champagne and fruit were waiting. I never like to write a review without some constructive notes. First the hotel building is old (although it's been fully modernized), so the outside walls tend to be very cold in the winter. Opening the closet door felt like opening a refrigerator. The should consider more insulation. Also, the water closet is a bit small relative to modern hotels. We will of course return.

Not free drinks for our trouble, but we had to pay and still wait! Then, we had made arrangements to receive a very important package at the hotel. When I checked in, they told me it was in security, and when I asked them to retrieve it, it was nowhere to be found. This carried on for 8 hours, until 1am when it finally appeared. Pretty annoying.

874,12/15/2006,QfPMf1M7w-e-3zxtkuV,"This place is way overrated.  Actually, for a party in the lobby area the place is fantastic and amazing.  But as far as the rooms... and people..  It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues.  Well, except Jessica is great! The rooms are small--not ""hotel in the city"" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small.  (The room 10' wide and was no more than 160 square feet).  The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop.  But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6"" deep...   I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) ... they came and fixed it, but still a hassle. There was no room service menu in our room, just a ""Dining In"" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service.  We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct.  They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup.  They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER?  How can room service not bring butter for toast?  It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice.  And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on...   (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ).  If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud.  Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard.   Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks.   And if you do go, avoid room 609...

889,10/11/2009,BIs185dMD3mI,"I  haven't been to the W Chicago - City Center in a while, so I thought it was time for a visit while in Chicago.  I'm a points whore so doing a ""mattress run"" is a no brainer for me. Hotel is located in the southwest portion of the loop, directly across from the Quincy CTA station. I arrived at 11 AM and noticed the lobby has been renovated.  It's eclectic modern.  Oversized lamps and an s curve sofa make up the main area of the ""living room"".   I walk thru the living room and over to the pods which are located in front of the elevators and I'm greeted warmly by not just one, but two staff members. Since it was so early I was going to ask if my luggage could be stored until check-in time and ill go out and do some other things.  They tell me no problem and as a returning guest they've assigned me a nice suite.  Surprisingly I was told my room was ready.  The property recognizes my Elite status, asks if I need a late checkout and inquires if I need my receipt emailed to me after check out..  Little things like this go a long way.   I go around the corner and enter what I describe as the vertigo elevators of death.  If you look at that mural for too long, you'll be sure to earl. I walk into my room to find I've been upgraded to a room I'd previously been assigned.  The room has been renovation the wall and door that separated the parlor from bedroom have been removed. There is now one central wall that houses a flat screen TV for each ""room"" When you enter the room, there is a powder room on the right and closet on the left.  As soon as you pass thru the entry you're in the parlor portion of the room.  There is a wet bar are and a half wall with a TV above and a desk below.  The desk is nice and very practical but with only a few sockets. The furniture on the parlor side of the room is a bit tacky and its like the hotel was trying to hard to be eclectic.  It's just didn't do anything for me. The sofa is hideous! Passing thru to the bedroom side of the room, the decor is much better, now this what I  think a W should ""look"" like.  The W Bed is totally inviting.  On the wall is 40 HD TV that is identical to the TV in the parlor. Due to the location there is not much of a view, but the room does offer a view of the Quincy CTA Station, which is perfect for train spotters.  I thought being close to the train might cause some noise, but I didnt hear a peep Off the bedroom is a hallway that houses a closet and leads you to the bathroom.  The bathroom is rather awkward. Walking into the bathroom, on the left near the door is the sink and to the right is the toilet and tub/shower. Disappointing that the room doesn't have a double vanity and that there is no separate shower. The sink is pretty small and does not leave much space to spread out. Two people cannot use the sink area at once.  In addition, I got water everywhere.  The room doesn't have a shower only a tub, but it's got some nice hardware and good water pressure.  The bathroom is stocked with the typical Bliss sink side six pack of toiletries. Sweat has nice equipment, cardio machines and free weights, but there is no pool. Some additional information: There is a small business center on the mid mezzanine level. High speed internet available for free in the lobby and its $14.95 in room and the hotel offers Acura service within five miles of the hotel. At checkout on of the associates I'm familiar with said, ""you're one of my favorite guest. You're so funny.  You've got to stay with us for more than just one night the next time you come."" FINAL IMPRESSION If you'd like a good hotel while in Chicago this is the place for you.  Just know that on weekends there isn't much around the hotel, so you'll need to travel outside of the loop for dining and entertainment options. The overall staff attitude has greatly improved.  They appeared to be appreciative of being employed and more than willing to help.   After checkout, I had a small billing issue (this is why I always request that my folio be emailed) where 36 dollars of items from the mini bar was charged to my folio.  When I called about this, it took a minute to remove, the staff apologized and I wasn't made to feel like a liar.  Good recovery and follow-up was good.   I would return to this hotel based on price and time of year, in the winter months i would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue.

890,9/26/2010,KPJbyOyOrNeVh1IlPDk7yA,"A lot of W hotels seem to be old Sheratons remodeled into a W hotel skin.  This W definitely felt like that - especially when you went upstairs with the low ceiling hallways and tiny rooms.  The overall decor, furnishings, and look of the hotel was probably a 3 - it wasn't the most creative W hotel lobby I've seen or rooms I've been in.   My Wonderful room was tinyyyy - if I sat at the desk to do work, I couldn't scoot my chair out all the way without hitting the bed - Anyone larger than me probably would have had trouble getting into the seat to begin with and I'm a 5 foot 2 small asian girl.  The bathroom was also very tiny with a very tiny sink.  It was pretty much impossible to wash my face in the sink without splashing water all over the tiny counter. That being said, for the week that I spent here I definitely started feeling at home and none of the above mattered to me.  The W hotel bed is HEAVENLY.  The room was well appointed and everything was placed in an space efficient way and I had enough room to function comfortably.  Flat screen TV and cable available.  Pretty fast wireless internet (it came free with my room - not sure if it applies to everyone), and I had a radio in my room so I was jammin out to music most of the time I was in the room.  I was having an awesome time in my room. What put the icing on the cake for this hotel was that the service was AMAZING.  Like possibly one of the best staff I've ever encountered at a hotel in my life.  And not the white glove butler type service you get at the Four Seasons where they HAVE to be at your beck and call, but everyone I encountered was sooo genuinely friendly - from the security guard who let me back into my room when I locked myself out of my room with no shoes on at 2 am, the concierge and the front desk, the cleaning ladies actually remembered my name, what room I was in, gave me extra bliss products.  I called down once for a toothbrush and they came instantaneously fast.  The guy who brought me room service was also extremely extremely cheerful and nice.  Every interaction with a staff here literally wowed me and left me with a smile on my face.   Now for some objective notes: Location is awesome.... if you're in Chicago for work.  It's in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of most large companies as well as near two L train stops.  That being said.... everything in Chicago's financial district (food-wise) shuts down at like 8 pm.. no joke and the streets in general were pretty deserted.  So.. because I work insane hours, room service was my best friend. Room service... argh.. despite their service being so amazing.. as can be expected from a hotel, it takes like 30 to 45 mins for them to bring you food - Comes on time though if you order breakfast.",4,1,0,0,N,WdkBHNy3eIWbzZeBuKHSGw,Marna P.,"West Hollywood, CA",September 2008,3,13,2,15,4,3,1,0,2,0.008718980549966466,MSjQYMXVSwysuAT2d-qExQ,Kiehl's,"Kiehl's - Georgetown - Washington, DC",17,4.5,"Beauty and Spas, Cosmetics & Beauty Supply, Shopping, Skin Care, METADATA","3110 M St NW (between N 31st St & N Wisconsin Ave) Washington, DC 20007 Neighborhood: Georgetown",Yes,$$$,None,http://www.kiehls.com,(202) 333-5101,0

897,4/4/2011,ZDbgI7gbb4SW4AfR6RtvIg,"This review is somewhat tempered by the fact that we got a good deal for the place, and the staff and service were mostly fine. I thought the lobby was interesting, although it takes a minute to even find the check in desk which seems apologetically superfluous to its main function, which is to double as an uber-contemporary lounge for the European twenty-something guests. You then enter the elevator under a flood of black light and Euro trance hits bumping through the speakers...at all times of day and night. I felt really sorry for the people's doors that are across from the elevators on each floor. Finally, the rooms are small to medium sized, as if you were in New York and not Chicago. Mattress was not so comfortable. The bathroom and shower were both nice and clean. The snack bar was dumped out over the shelves so the $8 Fiji water and accompanying organic snack bar stared at you in the face the entire time. A loud, clanging sound went off intermittently throughout the night whenever the air conditioning transitioned itself from one setting to another. It's a good thing I only needed to sleep one night of the two I was there. Otherwise it would have been miserable. On the bonus side we did get to interact with a famous and unfriendly hip hop star when our elevator stopped on his floor. So there's that. What I found most odd was that the hotel seems clearly suited for business travelers who need to be near the corporate offices in the area, but I really can't imagine most business travelers enjoying the place based on the above details and others (they had USA Today in the lobby, for example).   Summary: This hotel seems both pretentious and completely misguided for the area. I feel like these sorts of hotels might impress people who don't get to experience big cities very often but it just seemed tacky and dated to me, like a Puff Daddy music video, circa 2002. Not good for business travelers, not good for families with kids, not good for older folks. Good for European 20 somethings and perhaps the odd bachelor party, if they don't mind taking a cab to a part of the city that is alive at night.

Our suite was really nice. We had a separate living room with two couches, a dining room table and a large flat screen TV. There were closets everywhere. Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV. The only negative to the room was that the lighting was very dim (along with the rest of the hotel) so when it came time to do hair and make-up we called concierge for more lamps. And living up to their ""wherever, whenever"" motto, they brought up 4 table lamps in a jiffy! Overall I think this hotel was perfect for our wedding stay.

My family rented one of the condos on the 44th floor with a wrap-around balcony, the views were absolutely amazing. The door men were exceedingly helpful and friendly! I especially loved the outdoor pool, track, and garden area. My only disappointments were that this area closed to guests -- you couldn't even walk around!

The Radisson Blu Aqua is this pillar of awesomeness that is truly splendid both outside and in. They kept the wave theme throughout. The halls/room were decorated in an offbeat sort of way that I liked, with this blaring aqua colored carpet and then half the place had these little sparkly mica bits embedded in the floor, so it was like a disco ball in the entryway. The not so good: it was very quiet until Saturday night, when there was a huge party and the people next door were ordering room service at 2am. The doors on the rooms slam inadvertently. And when they were out on the balcony I could hear them speaking even though they were not speaking loudly. In the morning, a tourist ferryboat comes by on the river with a megaphone and it sounded like he was right in my ear. And I was on the 10th floor.

The lobby and rooms are impeccably decorated:  warm and inviting yet still sleek, modern and colorful.  The sparkly marble floors in the room are a stand out.  The shower and bath area is beautiful, and the rain showerhead is incredibly relaxing and upscale from most hotels I've stayed in.  The beds are super comfortable and warm.  Our room had a balcony, which was fantastic, even thought it was winter and we didn't get to use them.

948,5/2/2012,bP3N-SSa,"We were traveling from California to Chicago for the very first time. Prior to booking a hotel we did a lot of research online. Ultimately, we chose to book with Radisson Blu Aqua and I couldn't have been happier. A wonderful high end hotel & residence located in the heart of downtown Chicago's River North district.  We stayed for 5 days & 4 nights and every time we entered and left we were greeted by the doormen & other hotel staff. This hotel is state of the art in design and services. It ascends above the city and offers great views of downtown. It offers a sleek, sophisticated atmosphere, refined service and sweeping views at every turn. It's located just blocks from Chicago landmarks, such as, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave (high end shopping), and the Chicago Riverwalk. We rented a car from Midway Airport upon our arrival but we quickly realized that traveling by foot is much easier and faster. This may sound crazy, but Chicago traffic is 10x worse than in Los Angeles. Another downside, valet parking (with in/out privileges) is $45.00 a day at this hotel. A cab ride from the hotel to anywhere downtown cost us an average of 5-7 bucks one way. Another reason to walk or take a cab is because parking is a nightmare and very expensive throughout Chicago. If the weather was better we would have walked everywhere. Although the Filini bar is located in the lobby of this hotel, I did not factor my feelings into the 5 star hotel rating because they have their own yelp page. With that being said, I give Filini 1 star for food, service, and price of food versus quality. This place is full of hoity toity, pretentious individuals who wear designer clothing and think they are cooler than you. The service was horrible and I think the bartender forgot to put alcohol in our cocktails. Maybe because we were wearing jeans and t-shirts but we just spent the entire day walking around Chicago and wanted to end the night with food and a cocktail.... Ok back to the hotel... Our room had no refrigerator but it did have a coffee pot. There is a CVS Pharmacy directly next door where you can find cheap souvenirs, snacks, and a nice selection of alcohol (to stock up your room). Another great option for snacks, groceries, or alcohol is Mariano's Fresh Market which is located to the south of the hotel (3-5 minute walk). My fiancé and I both packed our gym outfits and had good intentions of using the fully furnished gym, but we found ourselves occupied with other activities. All in all, this is a great hotel in a great location.

The staff could not have been more friendly.  While the hotel is still in start up mode, everyone was genuinely and naturally friendly.  We found this to be true of the front desk staff, housekeeping, the lounge staff and those in the restaurant.  We especially liked breakfast.  While on the expensive side, or pretty typical for higher end hotels, the food was especially good.  Try the crepes!  They are wonderful. The only downside I can see is the cost of parking at $51.  We knew this in advance and parked next door at an Illinois Center garage for $30.  Just a pet peeve of mine, as I'm happy to pay for a nice room and good service, but I hate how all the downtown hotels gouge you on parking or don't offer a package that includes parking. We did not use the pool but there is a nice two lane lap pool and hot tub plus health club.  The location was also very convenient to Millenium park, loop theaters and Michigan Avenue.  In short, this hotel was everything we wanted for a relaxing, quick escape from the burbs.",5,0,0,0,N,Yt_3gq4Sb2X11XB8TsmvZg,jason a.,"Chicago, IL",August 2010,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0025252525252525255,dL8gadXiTWIoWzVReq_BGw,bOb Bar,"bOb Bar - Lower East Side - New York, NY",379,4.0,"Nightlife, Bars, Lounges, METADATA","235 Eldridge St (between Houston St & Stanton St) New York, NY 10002 Neighborhood: Lower East Side",Yes,$$,None,http://www.bobbarnyc.com/,(212) 529-1807,0

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.   We had a Groupon for a king room.  I had asked for possible upgrades - including $9/night for park view.  On check-in, we were told we got that upgrade.  I'm not positive the view we had was really what was meant by ""park view"".  We were in 1007 - facing north. Looking straight out - we looked into an office building.  If we looked right  we could see Navy Pier and the river.  Looking left - we could see a sliver of the Wrigley building.  We did not face the park.  I'm not sure if that upgrade included Navy Pier views OR Millenium Park, so we didn't say something. I'm not sure the view we had was worth $9 a night. The room was relatively compact - but nicely laid out.  I loved how clean and new it was.  There was a wood-laminate floor - with marble floor  in the entry area and bathroom.  We had a king bed with great bedding.  It was very comfortable (though the pillows were rather ""mushy"" - it was good we had 6 of them).  The bathroom was beautiful - with a separate soaking tub and walk in shower.  It was also very spacious.   The sliding door to the bathroom was fine for us - but I could see if you were sharing a room with someone other than a spouse, it could be a problem privacy-wise.  It definitely didn't muffle any noises from the bathroom!   The closet area was laid out nicely with three drawers and a good-sized safe.   The hanging area, however, was a bit small.  It was ok for us for just 2 nights - but for a longer stay with 2 people or more - it'd be tough.   There was a good-sized flat screen TV and desk area.   The public areas were very nice.  We enjoyed the bar - and had breakfast one morning in the restaurant.  The food and service were excellent.   We didn't use the indoor lap pool and spa or health club.  The health club area was very large with great equipment and even a half basketball court.   In the lobby area - there were a lot of areas to sit and lounge.   We were rather surprised by the $51/night charge for parking.  That seems rather high to me, particularly as we didn't use or ask for in/out privileges.   We would definitely come back.  It could be nice in the summer with that outdoor pool area.",5,1,0,0,N,TWPHCUPDUZaeV9UznzqroQ,Heather R.,"Chicago, IL",December 2008,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.002857142857142857,u5OQZVjtc47ziMWgcV4hkQ,Franklin Park,"Franklin Park - Prospect Heights - Brooklyn, NY",193,4.0,"Nightlife, Bars, METADATA","618 St John's Pl (at Franklin Ave) Brooklyn, NY 11238 Neighborhood: Prospect Heights",No,$$,None,http://www.franklinparkbrooklyn.com,(718) 975-0196,0

Barbara, the in-house the wedding planner was a breeze for the bride and groom to work with.  She was calm and thought of everything.  I too found communicating with her to be very easy.   The food was well beyond my expectations. The salad was not your average crank them out wedding salad.  The greens were fresh, the string beans delicious.  If you told me I was eating local organic produce, I would have believed you.  The steaks were so thick and delicious you would have thought this was a $150 per plate wedding meal, which I'm sure it was not.  The Holiday Inn outsources their cakes to Alliance Bakery.  I'm not a big wedding cake fan - because most just aren't that great.  This one was fantastic.  (Chocolate buttercream, chocolate cake, raspberry filling.) The venue let our friends bring in their own beer from outside.  This is unheard of at a hotel wedding venue.  Upcharging alcohol is a big part of how they make their money.  But our friends were able to pick up fantastic beer and bring it in to be served at the bar.  It saved them a bundle. They had an open bar all night long.  I'm not big into mixed drinks so I cannot comment on that aspect. Free rooms were included for the bride and groom and parents on the night of the wedding.  The couple said that nice perks like that were present throughout their whole experience. The only things I did not like were: They typically don't provide a holding room for the wedding party to wait in.  The part of the room where they stood for their ceremony had an exit door and exit sign right behind them.  Not the most beautiful backdrop to a wedding ceremony.  And when the clock struck leaving time - they threw on the florescent lights and herded everyone out as though it were a police raid.  I have worked catering and understand well the need to get guests out so crew can start to breakdown.  I'm sure their method was effective in doing so, but they could have used some more tact.   These negatives were minor compared to the service, the good price, the good food, and great views.

I did a little research and had figured it was HI-Mart and for the price (100 with tax) and how late it was when checking in (2AM) I figured the room wasn't going to matter too much. The parking was very easy and compared to other city hotels was reasonably priced for staying the night with in and out. I believe it was right around $34. The check in was quick and easy, as it should be at 2AM. Although the guy checking us in wasn't very talkative or warm to us. The room was a very large with a king bed and a sitting area. The view was not of much however this hotel does offer some amazing views. I would actually say some of the best in the city because of it's position. A definite plus to this hotel. Some things that bother me about hotels that HI had on the list. 1. I hate when electronics aren't in working order when walking into room. The TV was unplugged, the batteries needed changed in the remote and the clock needed set as it was  blinking. All simple things but also all simple things for the hotel staff to check on to make sure the room looks put together. 2. No info on Chicago in the room or info about the hotel. There was no book anywhere about restaurants in hotel, if room service was provided beyond breakfast, pool hours, etc. 3. Two VERY small pillows in the room isn't sufficient. Overall, I wouldn't stay again but it WAS  a great hotel for a quick sleep in Chicago. I prefer a hotel with a more boutique feel and attention. Also, for me, the location wasn't ideal to being where I like to be in Chicago. For a family trip, reunion or even a guys weekend, I think this hotel would fit well.

I help host an event (the Chicago(ish) Tweetup) twice a year and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is our go-to hotel for a variety of reasons: The sales staff is wonderful and always happy and quick to accommodate us, and they even work to find rooms at the group rate for last-minute travelers. The staff at the front desk and concierge are also friendly and willing to assist guests with their needs; I've yet to encounter a rude staff member in my five visits to this location.

The location is fantastic, with views of the Chicago River and the city's lovely, gritty architecture, whether buildings or bridges. Thanks to the Brown Line Merchandise Mart El stop, it's possible to reach the hotel via public transportation from either major Chicago airport and avoid car rental and parking fees altogether, though check the hours for the Brown Line, as it does not run all night. The Cityscape Lounge is pricey and the service is on the slower side, but it's ideal for a cocktail hour kickoff and the bar food is pretty good. (The view from the lounge is incredible.)

Although we didn't have our wedding at the hotel, our guests were encouraged to stay here for the following reasons: 1. Great location for public transit, cabs or driving. (Parking is expensive at $34/night, but you do get in/out privileges.) 2. Great rate for Chicago. The city views (if you're lucky to not get a room overlooking the pool roof) are out of this world. Just stunning! 3. Great service. I worked directly with the sales office (thanks Diane and Charnita!) and they were able to accommodate some people that missed the reservation cut off. And they gave them the special rate as well. 4. Our room was huge! I had asked nicely about getting a comp room (being the bride and all, I thought I'd ask!) and was pleasantly surprised that we were given a suite! The room had a king size bed and a big sitting area with couch, coffee table and four lounge chairs (Rm 2048). The view was a northern view of the lake and the Hancock. Very, very nice! Only drawbacks: 1. The bar was packed on the Saturday night (I think there were 2 weddings going on in the hotel) and service was slower than molasses, but the view is awesome, so waiting wasn't that huge of a deal. 2. Having to go all the way down to the main building lobby to smoke. Yeah, I know, that's really not the hotel's fault and I really should just quit, but it is a pain in the ass when you're super anxious about your wedding day and having to wait on everyone else to be ready so you can get ready, etc. etc. 3. Room service prices were ridiculous. I recommend you go down to the deli in the main building lobby for breakfast! $4.25 got me an egg, bacon and cheese bagel sandwich and a cup of coffee.

Maybe time for an upgrade. The room has two bedrooms and a nice living room. No less than 3 restrooms, 2 showers, so quite nice. The beds are very comfortable. The daily internet rate is $19, which is a bit steep, for mediocre speed. The room has an internet terminal and there is wireless access through iBahn.

Now, the qualification: We checked in to the Intercontinental because our friend was having her wedding there, and  we didn't want to have to drive back home after a late night drinking. Plus, I've always wanted to stay there. First bad thing: the front desk gentleman was very pushy about selling their ""Ambassador"" program for $150. I told him we were short on time and needed to be off in a hurry. He actually held our room key in the air out of our grasp while he continued to rattle on for five minutes about the Ambassador program and how he really thought it would be a good idea for us to go ahead and sign up so we'd get a free upgrade to a suite. We were three minutes late to the wedding and had to watch the procession from the rear. So, we put that behind us and enjoyed a nice reception in the Intercontinental ballroom. Nobody can say the hotel isn't beautiful inside. Going back to our room at 11:45 we noticed that the room's  windows overlooked a brick wall - the new tower next door. OK, so no view. I suppose that a view of Michigan avenue runs an extra $100 at least. Fair enough. But the other problem quickly became  apparent - rooms on the 9th floor have a ballroom directly below them. We were able to heard the band talking between numbers, as well as the loud, thumping music. And I mean it was loud. Not acceptable. After a little run-around trying to get a manager, we were offered $100 off. Nope. They couldn't tell us when the music would stop. Finally, begrudgingly they offered to refund our money and let us go home since there were absolutely no rooms available to move us to. (However, I bet if I forked over the $150 for the Ambassador program., a suite upgrade would have magically appeared...) So in the end we would up driving back home, tired and hung over. Shame on us for trying to go to sleep in peace at 11:45pm... Two stars because, come on, this is the Intercontinental Michigan Ave. They should have their shit together and not make me feel that I am some lousy peon who gets the third-class room in steerage because I don't have status.

Our room was in the older of the hotel's two towers, the one that used to house the Medina Athletic Club.  The room was on the 25th floor, and had great views up and down Michigan Avenue and out to the west. The Room itself was very spacious, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate shower and bath. We got brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the buffet was off the chain in terms of quality and selection.  It was also priced accordingly . . . The topper, though, was the fitness facility housed in the hotel.  You have not only the gorgeous and historic swimming pool, but a full complement of cardio and weight equipment.  And the dry sauna was delightfully hot. On the down side (and hence the missing star), this place nickels and dimes you on things like internet.  I've heard not-so-great things about the promptness of their room service, but, almost needless to say, we did not order room service.  (At $18 for a ""Maxwell street polish sausage,"" can you blame us?)",4,1,1,0,N,U-N--wUfh2Yq43m6waEzlg,Nikki L.,"Elgin, IL",December 2010,1,12,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0.01791044776119403,NNu9E0SbPVQJAzbLYo0FCg,Copia,"Copia - Midtown East - New York, NY",69,3.0,"Nightlife, Bars, Lounges, METADATA","307 E 53rd St (between 1st Ave & 2nd Ave) New York, NY 10022 Neighborhood: Midtown East",Yes,$$,None,http://www.copianyc.com,(212) 838-0007,0

I would say that Hotwire/Groupon are the way to go for this place.  I think single rooms with a King-sized bed usually go for around $300, and that simply is too much for what you get.  The room was rather small, and as a result the furniture was awkwardly placed, with the TV oriented perpendicularly to the bed and difficult to watch from the bed.  But for $99, with access to a gym and a pool (neither of which we used--it was a laaaazy weekend)?  Definitely a deal.",3,0,2,0,N,uEoqNNRBEV3eNDWlo5_0YA,Lynn L.,"Jenkintown, PA",January 2010,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.00099601593625498,UORdaLVnJ6n-RLVc35Arqw,Plunge,"Plunge - West Village - New York, NY",133,2.5,"Add, METADATA","18 9th Ave (between 13th St & Little W 12th St) New York, NY 10014 Neighborhoods: West Village, Meatpacking District",Yes,$$$,None,http://www.chinagrillmgt.com,(212) 660-6736,0

Check in was fast and my husband had no problems.  (We typically stay at Intercontinentals and have had our share of problems with checking in on past vacations.)  The room was clean and decent - had 2 full bathrooms and we had a view of Michigan Avenue from the 10th floor which was nice.  The location was great and it is right across the street from a mall and right by all the North Michigan shopping areas.  I was impressed with the bed - it was very comfortable.  Bed and pillows were perfect - and for me, that doesn't happen very often.  The hotel has a place called Eno which is a place where you can sample wine, chocolates, and cheese and the Michael Jordan Steakhouse is also inside.  Valet and doormen were very helpful which was appreciated.  The only downfall of our trip and the reason why I didn't give the hotel 4 stars is because it was very loud as I was trying to go to sleep.  The walls appear to be very thin and the group in the room next to me were being very loud - laughing, talking (I could tell you every word in their conversations...) and just having a good time.  Now I understand that I am in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, however, I am a customer too and I feel that at 1:30 a.m, I should be able to get some rest.  I called downstairs to ask the front desk what could be done and she said she would send security up....around 2:30 a.m., the noise finally stopped.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if I didn't have a train to catch at 6:00 a.m.  But anyways, that was the only thing I didn't like, that it took security almost an hour to get the people quieted down.  Good hotel otherwise.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Right now the pool is closed for renovations and hotel valet overnight is $54.  Wowza, good thing we took a cab.  Cabs are aplenty in this area so that was no problem, but Michigan Ave. is very trafficky, so you may pay more because you sit in traffic a lot.  Also, the hotel in general is a bit noisy because cabbies like to honk their horns as if it's gonna make anyone move faster, and that can be heard from inside the hotel at times.",3,0,0,0,N,ZLczJE0VWV4ooB1xyI6FgA,Jennifer W.,"Chicago, IL",July 2011,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0.002183406113537118,5nxWVS5W2tNNRj2_xZNJ1A,Lulu Cake Boutique,"Lulu Cake Boutique - CLOSED - Chelsea - New York, NY",93,4.0,"Food, Bakeries, METADATA","112 8th Ave (between 16th St & 15th St) New York, NY 10011 Neighborhoods: Chelsea, Meatpacking District",Yes,$$,None,http://www.everythinglulu.com/,(212) 242-5858,0

When we checked in, we had a King Suite reserved.  We were traveling with an infant & two baby sitters in tow.  The room was nice, but there was no seperation between the sitting room and bed room, eventhough it appeared so on the website.  They also said there were two bathrooms... while this room had one.  My husband called the front desk, and they told him that nothing else was available.  Boo... but we would survive.  I also had read somewhere that there was a fridge available in each room.  One more call to the front desk reveiled the fact, that only the mini bar is available.  I was informed though by the room service man, that if I opened the bar, removed items, but left them with the bar, we would not be charged, because it was not one of those lame pressure sensitive ones.  Yay!   So, my husband went to check in with some friends about the quickly impending wedding (1 hr away) and on his way back to the room he checked at the desk and was able to get us the room that we were looking for!   TIP - after booking we joined the frequent guest club... so when they asked my hubbie if he belonged they gave us the upgrade.

So i said no, because it's going to be an inconvenience and checkout is at 11am so I stated that it wouldn't help.

The room itself was great, we had a view over Michigan Avenue on the 36th floor. The bed was so comfortable, and we had plenty of space. Also pretty sure any reviews complaining about elevators are VERY outdated. There are 6 ""low-rise"" elevators that go to the 28th floor and then 6 for the higher level floors. There was almost always one sitting in the lobby to head up, and if there wasn't, you barely had to wait...unless you were the idiots who weren't aware you had to press the button and not just stare at it because you don't have elevator buttons on your farm in Iowa.

As other Yelpers mention, the location of this hotel is absolutely the best quality about it. We had excellent train access to Wrigley Field and could walk to wonderful restaurants as well as waterfront activities. Getting out of Chicago in the morning was super efficient, driving down Ontario to I-94 for freeway access. We did have some trouble getting to the valet parking entry when we first arrived, as that entry is on Rush street, and when we went past it, it took us awhile, with the one-way streets and the river, to loop back around. The lobby is incredibly busy and hopping, but even so, we managed to check in very quickly on a Sunday. We also had access to our room before the posted check-in time, which was a wonderful treat. We had a room on a  high floor with a king bed, but we didn't have views of the lake (ask for that!). The room was not large, but it had everything we needed and was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. In fact, overnight I was sick with a migraine and throwing up, and this is the one time in my life when such suffering away from home did NOT make me wish to be home in my own bed. Everything was very comforting and comfortable. Again, I noticed this Marriott did not include a hairdryer in the room. (I've noticed this recently in Marriott properties.) I brought my own, so I did not mind. Also, the WiFi is NOT included in the room price.

I'm sure there is an excellent logistical reason for why they did that, but it was a pain if we wanted to visit other people in our party. 3) No mini-fridge in OUR room at least (we found others had mini-fridges in their rooms) but their rooms had one bed as opposed to two? Perhaps that was the difference? 4) Small bathrooms. Not to mention, our toilet kept running the entire night. 5) We had luke-warm water the last morning we were there. 6) SMALL pool with a smaller fitness center (but the weight room was located in a different location which was quite spacious). Though all in all, the Marriott was a pretty nice place to stay. They had a real Starbucks in their lobby (but its not 24 hour). Free wifi on the 2nd floors and lobby. The food offered in the hotel was also REALLY good. We had a banquet there and the food was exceptional.

I rather stay off of Michigan Ave. if it meant we can stay at a hotel where it is cleaner and spacious. We arrived during the conference and it took awhile for us to check-in. Unfortunately, it was during high school proms, the lobby was swamped with 4 different proms the weekend and the attendees of the conference (McCormick Convention Center). I was not impress with the wait in the elevators and because it was so crowded with unsupervised teenagers and professionals, getting to the top floor was a hike. The hallway was very narrow and gloomy with unattractive 70's carpet. The room was very tight. It was two double with a 'view' but it was not much of a view. The got us excited during check in but the room/ window was against a wall so we can only see out at an angle. The bathroom was very ugly. The tub was standard and small. Very dated. The toilet was old and the seat was chipping so I can't tell if they cleaned the toilet or not. The closet door did not slide; we called someone to fix it and not one came by to fix the door during our stay. (5 days of neglect). The iron did not work so we had to call for another one. We needed to iron our clothes for work. That was also a drag. Bar was small and dingy. The desk did not know of late night restaurants. Getting a cab was about 20-30 minute wait. I was not impressed at all. The city is full of fun things to do but at the end of the day, we dreaded coming back to our room.

You walk in the door to a stair entrance down to the lounge/lobby and bar area, which is very welcoming. *The first course, a tomato bisque crostini (crostada? crostadelicious is all I have to say) was impressive- rich tomato cream soup served in ramekins covered with a pot-pie like flaky crust. Pretzel rolls and a variety of others complimented the first course really nicely and had me excited for the rest--dinner (chicken/mashed potatoes) and dessert (tiramisu) were fine but not noteworthy. Average wedding food fare. *The decor: strange jellyfish/bubbly like chandeliers that weren't so weird as to be distracting, but were still pretty enough to comment on. The room decor and lighting overall were pleasant. Also, to enter for dinner, a guy walked around with a mini-vibe set playing to get our attention to announce that it was time to sit down. Old school style.   Otherwise this was a pretty average experience. The house red wine at the bar upstairs (7th floor was where we were at) was Estancia, which I have found is becoming increasingly common. It's okay but not preferable.

Starbucks There was a line in the morning, but you can't beat the convenience of having one in the lobby (or one right across the street, or one two doors down.....) Location Walk out the back door, walk down Michigan Avenue...... Staff Nothing but great things to say about the staff.  Everyone that we encountered was just fantastic The Bad: Elevators If you were on floors 29 on up (which we were) there was always a significant wait for the elevators.  There was a bank of eight elevators servicing these floors, but only two were running.  Someone told me that the staff claimed this was temporary, but I had the same issue on both visits, which were eight months apart. Street Noise Maybe I'm just a country bumpkin, but there sure was a lot of street noise coming up to the 37th floor.  It may have just been our particular room, bu it seemed like the seals on our window weren't tight and a lot of outside noise was getting in.

1140,9/7/2012,6TJwmqrx0DB,"I will admit it, the Hilton in downtown Chicago is not my usual go-to for accommodations in the city. It's the place that, when on vacation there I would always see it and sigh and think, when I have enough money I would love to stay there. So, this past weekend, while in town for a wedding, my fiancé and I decided to treat ourselves and get a room here. Now, let me say up front, that the entrance lobby is very impressive. And the suites that the bridal party were in were absolutely gorgeous. Even our floor and room were rather tasteful, if you like modern-chic. Also, it is very clean, as one should expect of place with such a high reputation. Hence why I gave it two stars instead of one. Now, the bad. First of all, a lot of these have to do with price. I am stating this up front because yes, we did understand that we would be paying quite a bit. Hence the whole ""we decided to treat ourselves"" bit. What I didn't know, and wish I had, was that despite the fact that you pay twice, even three times the amount on a room here compared to most places, our money only went about half, even a third as far as it does at those other places. 1) There is no included wifi. You must pay for it, and there is no wired connection option. Considering the cost of wifi or a wired connection, this seemed extremely tacky and cheap 2) No breakfast. Of any kind. You either pay the overly extravagant prices of the restaurant connected to the lobby, which is mostly a bar and dinner place to begin with, or have a coffee and breakfast at Starbucks. Not very classy for a place like the Hilton. 3) The room, despite being exorbitantly expensive, was incredibly small. We were so cramped, we had to pack our stuff away in the silly wardrobe/closet they give you, or risk several stubbed toes or possible broken bones from tripping over our weekend suitcases. (Note, these were small enough to be airplane carry-ons). 4) This size issue was also an issue in the bathroom, the shower of which was so small that if you dropped something, you would have to open the door to bend down and pick it up. 5) Yes, it was clean. In a there's-no-mold-or-bugs way, but the ceiling was dusty and full of cobwebs. 6) View. Even though this hotel is in the center of Chicago, right across Michigan Ave from the park, we got to look at a brick wall...and our neighbors. 7) Without telling us, up front, at the desk or otherwise, they overcharged our credit card to cover a per night deposit. I don't have a problem with this in principle, but it's a good thing we weren't close to our limit because not knowing that that would go on there, even temporarily, could have caused some major problems. 8) No help with parking. I know that most hotels charge for parking, especially in downtown Chicago, but several I have stayed at give a discount or some sort of thing for their guests. Or at least a price that is competitive. However, this didn't end up being a huge problem, since we just saved $20 a day by parking in the Millennium garage instead. Good thing we did too, because apparently the extra cost of parking at the Hilton didn't make your car any safer as one of our family member's had her car broken into while parked there. Basically, the hotel was rather nice. But expensive. And I don't mean in a ""you have to pay to get nice things way."" We actually got much less for our money all around than we do at our usual vacation spot (the Embassy Suites). Basically, you stay here if you have so much money you enjoy spending it unnecessarily. Your money buys you the location, and the prestige of telling cab drivers ""The Hilton, please.""",2,0,0,0,N,Nybw4RhZvdexOR-XgXD4DQ,Michele Ruthiemay B.,"Lafayette, CA",June 2008,3,8,0,6,2,10,0,0,1,0.00505369551484523,tT4s82641Q2sLsizpM8o0A,Phil's Pizza Palace Inc,"Phil's Pizza Palace Inc - Watertown, WI",2,3.0,"Restaurants, Pizza, METADATA","112 S 2nd St Watertown, WI 53094",Yes,$,None,None,(920) 261-0102,0

1160,6/23/2009,1vM6,"Having won my Chicago HQ off of Priceline for $67 a night, I was a bit disappointed when it was unveiled.  For hotels, I'm more of a contemporary modern type of guy and the photos for this place were definitely ""historical Old World"" luxury.  But, the old gal can surprise a jaded Pink Mafia member like me.   I had woken up at 345 AM to make a 7 AM flight (Why the heck did I do this on my vacation?) and then used public transit to get into the city.  I walked the remaining 5 blocks dragging my suitcase through the streets of Chicago for all to see.  Sort of a paleta man but with underwear, t-shirts, and shoes instead. Entering the building from a side entrance, the place is monstrously big (taking up a whole city block) with dark carpet and wood everywhere, shops, various public rooms, meeting rooms, and staircases galore.  Finally, I hunted down the front desk which was equally big.  But, Sara was warm, cordial, and professional - with her tone, she was able to scale down the hotel so that all that mattered was our chat. There are 14 elevators to take you to your room:  4 of them are reserved for the HHonors members' floors while I, as a member of the riff-raff, had to 'fight' for one of the other 10 elevators.  In my 2.5 days there, I never had to share one with anyone so those of you wanting to hear about ""Elevator Fight Club"" will be disappointed. Requested a wired internet room (only 30% of their rooms are capable of this - but all are WiFi enabled).  You get choices of broadband internet:  premium, advanced, basic, and hourly.  Rates per day:  $19.99, $17.99, $14.99, and $2.50 respectively.  Yes, no free internet.  Yes, it is nuts.  Forewarned is forearmed. My double/double room had 2 full bathrooms at either end of the room.  Why?  I don't know.  Reading up on the hotel, it turns out that only 300 of the 1,544 rooms have this double bathroom thing going on.  So, for you bathroom-philes, here's your personal Nirvana.  Request and enjoy.  Just for kicks, I took turns using each bathroom.  Hey, I was on vacation. The bedding and linens are upgraded with Sealy Serenity beds, high-numbered thread counts, and a good assortment of new pillows.  The bath fixtures are gold-colored so popular decades ago but functional.  My standard huge armoire had an old-school TV in it.  No in-room safe, though.  I declined the mini-bar key so if there were bundles of cash or jewelry from the Titanic in there I can't tell you. It was stuffy when I opened the door so, being a resident of the South, I knew that the first order of business was to turn on the air conditioning to the maximum setting.  When I returned from lunch two hours later, it was still unpleasant.  I called the customer care hotline:  Ann promptly answered within 2 rings, apologized when I explained the situation, and promised to dispatch maintenance immediately.  He was at my door within 5 minutes and fixed the issue within 10 minutes.  Ann called back to follow up within 5 minutes departure of the maintenance guy.  I thanked her for the prompt service and follow up.  This was a memorable part of the great service - they really do care, even if you low-balled them on Priceline. Fronting South Michigan Avenue and Grant Park, there are plenty of buses and cabs available if you want to get to other parts of the city.  The ""El"" (elevated train) is a few blocks away.  The well-designed Millennium Park, the stupendous Art Institute, and the amazing Cloud Gate sculpture (commonly called ""the Bean"") are also an easy 15-minute walk away.  Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a good value for $67 per night for even a non-traditional guy like me.",3,15,7,8,N,-S8etpB2H9mQPSp5ZgyB2Q,Stephanie D.,"Chicago, IL",February 2012,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03292181069958848,DdkzNSGaCnBhm1JzT7ylIw,Monkey Forest Road,"Monkey Forest Road - Grand Lake - Oakland, CA",64,4.0,"Shopping, Home & Garden, Furniture Stores, Arts & Entertainment, Art Galleries, Food, Coffee & Tea, METADATA","3265 Grand Ave (between Elwood Ave & Santa Clara Ave) Oakland, CA 94610 Neighborhoods: Grand Lake, Lower Hills",Yes,$$,No,http://www.monkeyforestroad.com,(510) 327-2400,0

The 3 day conference was held in the Grand Ballroom for over 300 professionals in private equity, investment banking and mergers and acquisitions.   As an exhibitor/vendor at a professional conference, the main goal is to display your product or services to attract the attention of the conference attendees.  For 3 days I was at the hotel from early morning to early evening working as an exhibitor for one of my clients.  Because I am self employed, I brought my own laptop to use at the conference table.  This was to be used to show attendees the web based services that my clients had to offer.  There were over 20 exhibitors in the Grand Ballroom and many of them had laptops, lcd screens and other electronic equipment on their tables.   There was zero communication from the Hilton Chicago to inform us that we should have any concerns when leaving this equipment unattended. On the third and final day of the conference, I had my iPhone plugged into my laptop to charge and spent the morning at the table.  I had gotten up a few times to network around the room, and left the computer on the table, just as I had the previous two days.  Around 10:45am I got up to use the restroom and returned to my exhibitor table to find that in less than five minutes, my laptop and attached cell phone had been taken. I immediately reported this to security.  They were very slow in the process of questioning me and when I asked them about the security cameras, they informed me that the ONE camera they had in the Grand Ballroom does not cover the section of the room where my table was.  This piece of information alone screams DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE HILTON CHICAGO.  How can a hotel in Chicago on Michigan Ave only have one security camera in their GRAND BALLROOM?  Not smart, not secure, not safe. In most situations I would never EVER leave my belongings unattended.  In a situation where you are in a professional work environment and your equipment is being used for work, there should be a feeling of security.  A person should not have to pack up their electronic equipment every time they need to use the rest room.  After over a month of communication with the hotel security, the only resolution they had was to compensate me for less than half of what it would cost to replace the items.  Their insurance policy stated that the loss was not covered because I was not a guest of the hotel.  (any person who walks into that hotel and pays to walk into that hotel should be considered a guest) I was treated as if I was neglectful and irresponsible yet they offered to partially compensate me to shut me up?  Bad business practice in my opinion.   Unprofessional, unethical and unsecured.  Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1,15,1,4,N,Q_QfVg-YgMcqCR9jdg6oKg,P C.,"Skokie, IL",May 2010,0,13,2,13,2,1,0,0,1,0.014705882352941176,J43lVK_6tL8zONkwXsv46A,Mama's Royal Cafe,"Mama's Royal Cafe - North Oakland - Oakland, CA",471,3.5,"Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Diners, METADATA","4012 Broadway (between 40th St & 40th Street Way) Oakland, CA 94611 Neighborhood: North Oakland",No,$$,No,http://www.mamasroyalcafeoakland.c…,(510) 547-7600,0

The rooms are a bit smaller than at other Hilton locations, but very nicely appointed and comfortable, they appear to have undergone renovation recently.  Internet is $14.95 per 24 hours, which I find to be rather exorbitant, but it is very fast. This Hilton still has a single smoking floor, thank god, so smokers, book away!   The Executive Lounge on the 24th floor has a great view of Grant Park and is a comfortable place to spend some time.  The attendants are very friendly and they keep it stocked with soda (Coke!), coffee, tea, bottled water, cookies & snacks all day.  More substantial snacks are available during the Honors Reception from 5-7 each evening, but this is one of those Hiltons that actually charges for cocktails during the reception, so boo on that.  If you are a Hilton Diamond, skip the lobby and check in on the 24th floor, no lines and the concierges up there are very fast and friendly. Several restaurants on the property, including the infamous Kitty O'Sheas, Chicago's unofficial dem rallying point during election cycles and my personal favorite place to watch election returns.  Food at all the restaurants is above average for hotel fare, if a bit pricey.  I really like the prime rib sandwich at Kitty O'Sheas - quite nicely done for a hotel bar, tender and you generally get the meat cooked the way you request it. Excellent staff overall, they did an absolutely amazing job dealing with the capacity crowds on hand for Obama and maintained a friendly and helpful demeanor in the face of crazed and drunken Dems celebrating the end of our political exile.  Although the Drake is still my favorite Hilton property in the city, this is a close second and a great option if you are looking for a nice hotel in the loop.",5,4,4,3,N,OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ,Bill Travel Guy M.,"Chicago, IL",July 2005,902,1180,457,1447,1016,495,945,1,26,0.44545111362778406,5ECRunPIM2Gzh1YNaCgVoA,Au Natural,"Au Natural - Montclair Village - Oakland, CA",16,4.5,"Beauty and Spas, Skin Care, Day Spas, METADATA","2064 Antioch Ct Ste B (at Mountain Blvd) Oakland, CA 94611 Neighborhoods: Montclair Village, Oakland Hills",Yes,$$,None,http://aunaturalskincarecenter.com,(510) 339-1152,0

First off in clear violation of the Hilton booking rules, I reserved the cheapest room possible for one person...with the intent of having about 7 people stay in it. We needed a place to crash after a friend's birthday celebration. They either didn't realize when I led the field trip up to the room, or just looked the other way. In either case...cool. I have Hilton Diamond status, so they automatically upgraded me to a lake view room, which was nice. It also had two bathrooms, which was odd, but nice for all the people. The room was nice - very comfortable beds, good sized and with a nice view as well. The lobby was quite impressive, very plush, and staff were incredibly helpful. i was not able to try any of the restaurants, since I was with friends who had other (liquid) dining plans. There was also an interesting goody in the room - a $50 off coupon (with qualifying purchase) at a costume jewelery store in the lobby. I offered it to a friend, and I went down with her since I wanted to get something to munch on later. (Forget paying for the mini-bar stuff) Who do we run in to in the lobby? Fonzie. Seriously.

In addition to this, I was shocked that we were charged for Internet.  We had stayed at a Comfort Inn earlier in the year and we got free Internet.  Here we were at the friggin' Hilton and we had to pay $4 an hour to use the Internet or $0.69 a MINUTE to use the system downstairs?  Ugh.  You've got to be kidding me. To make matters worse, our smoking room was to be changed to a non-smoking room the next day.  After making arrangements with the concierge, I was told that someone would be up within 15 minutes to bring me the keys to our new room.  An hour goes by and no one shows up.  I finally storm down to the desk to find out what happened and get it straightened out. The rooms weren't even that great.  They were pretty average and still had old CRT TVs.  Like I said, I expected a certain level of service from the Hilton and it just did not deliver.  If I'm paying this much for a room, I expect it to be worth it.  This was not.  Needless to say, we'll never stay in a Hilton hotel again.",1,3,1,0,N,QrP9FVvNwLd7Isv24zCw5A,"Stella to the Bella, Born this Way, Y.","Chicago, IL",March 2006,347,618,40,644,446,195,367,11,19,0.256857855361596,Bn6rOzlL8-OnEIh7dSbJ1Q,Urban Home Consignment Furniture,"Urban Home Consignment Furniture - Berkeley, CA",24,3.5,"Home Services, Interior Design, Shopping, Antiques, METADATA","1825 Eastshore Hwy www.urbanhomeberkeley.com (between Virginia St & Hearst Ave) Berkeley, CA 94710",Yes,$$,None,None,(510) 647-5042,0

I booked with Priceline for $79 (Name Your Own Price) as opposed to paying $225 per night. At $225, I'd be annoyed. At $79, I'm delighted. The staff is marginal. The front desk clerk was mildly snotty. The concierge didn't answer on my first two calls and on the third was less than helpful. Parking is $55 per night valet, and a deal (hahahahaha) for self park at $42. Drive down Wabash or park on Harrison for $19 to to $25 for 24 hours. I CANNOT STAND PARKING IN CHICAGO!!! That said, the room was surprisingly nice. I'm""m a Diamond HHonors member and the snotty desk clerk upgraded us even though she let me know that HHonors benefits did not apply to us lowly Priceline guests. We had an incredible view of the Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium as well as Lake Michigan. I like the Hilton toiletries - they smell like rosemary. There were plenty of towels and washcloths in the bathroom. The marble sink, tub and floor were nice. The wallpaper seemed dated. The furniture was decent - it looked like a knock off of the original. The bedspread seemed kind of cheap but the pillows, chairs and sheets were decent quality. I was surprised at the OLD television. No flat screens here! The air conditioning system seemed arcacic but - WOW - it did the job.   The windows actually open! The fitness center and pool were state of the art. This is the nicest pool I have seen at a Hilton property and the fitness center is huge. The lobby is a a bit of a maze and finding the reception desk required some navigation. That said, be prepared for a loooooonnnnnnngggg walk to your room. The hotel takes up an entire city block. Add the zigs and zags of and old hotel and, well, you don't have to go to the fitness center to get your exercise.  There are plenty of elevators but be sure to get on the right one.  Some go to the lower floors, some to the upper 'Executive' floors.  BTW my 'upgrade' didn't get me Executive status. Forget dining at the Hilton. Walk 3 blocks to Panera Bread or even 2 blocks to Subway for breakfast. Walk out the backdoor to the Liquor Warehouse for beer, wine or booze.

The hotel itself is a giant historic Art Decoish building with impressive chandeliers and halls. Quite a landmark even though I have to remark that I have been to more inviting looking hotels (it's size makes it a bit borg-cube-like and its all dark bricks). As many hotels in historic buildings it seemed a bit dated to me furnishing wise (a lot of carpet in that place ...) and extremely dated interior-stylewise. Curtains and carpets and all the furniture are dark and kind of Empire-ish. Most people under 40 probably feel as akward entering a room like this as I did - probably a lot of people past their 40s either! Priceline made me stay in this Hilton - would not necessary have chosen this ""grand hotel"" style - helped save the budget though. Still, I had a decent stay here. Staff was friendly, especially the room maides. They asked me and my husband every morning if we had any special wishes apart from regular cleaning. We successfully ordered anti-allergic foam pillows instead of the feathery ones. Bathrooms are spacious and all marble, pretty cool. Shower, TV, Coffeemaker and everything else worked fine. As we came to explore Chicago (in which case the hotel is not at all a bad option as it is great to walk to everywhere from here) we did not spend time in any of the fitness and restaurant facilities of the hotel. Overall very ok experience to stay there but I kind of missed a real ""soul"" of the place - especially as it obviously tries to maintains this ""historic"" image.

I was informed that this would not be a problem. When we arrived in Chicago, the hotel's attached parking ramp seemed rather hard to find.

Anyone who can appreciate historic buildings will love this hotel. Given the lateness of our arrival, there was not much of a line, and only a few individuals working the desk, which I expected. However, I was rather dismayed to find out that the only room they had left available (I had booked a room with two queen-sized beds) was a ""parlor,"" which is simply a living room area attached to a larger suite. It has it's own bar area, TV, desk, computer, and bathroom, but only a pull-out sofa bed. It was only for one night and we were very tired. Knowing that these things happen, I grabbed the keys. I was, however, disappointed that this happened given I had called several hours prior to avoid this very thing. The parlor was more than adequate for a few people, but if I were to have had a party of 4 or more, I may have been more upset. It did slightly bother me they didn't offer any form of ""apology"" or incentive to make me feel welcome. It almost felt like a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" situation, and did not make me feel very valued. I appreciated that taxis were always available on the Michigan Avenue entrance of the hotel (consequently one of the most beautiful parts of the lobby as well). As a full-service hotel in a downtown metro, it annoys me when people complain about the nickling and diming. Yes, there is a charge for the internet, fitness center, breakfast, and items in the room. This is to be expected, and I will not knock the hotel, as it was my decision to stay here. Other reviewers would be wise to remember that. You're not getting a free buffet for your family of six at this hotel. The next day, we switched rooms to a room with two queen beds and two bathrooms (which I VERY much appreciated the next morning). The only complaint I can make about the rooms are that the windowsills had a lot of dead bugs on them, and notes advising guests to be cautious of opening the windows, lest bugs get in. Advice was noted and well-taken. The beds were nothing outstanding, surprisingly, as I do prefer a softer bed. The bathrooms had very nice gold accents and everything in the room was very well cleaned/appointed. However, when we were in the process of switching rooms, there was a VERY long line of guests, and it took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of it. I was shocked to see only two people working on a Saturday morning during Lollapalooza, which was across the street. They definitely needed more staffing both mornings I was downstairs. In summary, there are a lot of great things about this hotel. It is very historic, well maintained, and I felt a lot richer than I was staying in it. The rooms were nicely appointed and the location was great (though it's still a few blocks away from the shopping areas of Michigan Avenue). I can say, however, that I would not pay to stay here unless I were to get a good deal again, as the service, while not terrible, was very flat and apathetic. The desk agents, regardless of the time of day or night, sounded bored, uninterested, and I got a very unapproachable vibe from many of them, though they were never downright rude to me. Perhaps this is because they are trained to be ""professional"". A little smiling never hurt anyone. The Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location that is simply hampered by a few rough edges. From my experience, my only complaints were being stuck in a parlor room when I was guaranteed a two queen-bed guest room and the flat service from the employees (perhaps the biggest turn off for me). I suspect that if I wanted to be obnoxious, I could've mentioned my complaints to the desk and I have may have received some sort of compensation, though I am not that kind of person and nothing about the stay (except the room issue) even remotely seemed to warrant that kind of complaining. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really consider these minor issues to be indicative of a poor hotel. We had no issues with the cleanliness or noise, and I would stay here again, though I'd make sure I found a better deal than rack rate.",3,0,0,0,N,OTTvZoUx5S61vtQ9_YuASA,Jenn B.,"East Lansing, MI",June 2009,16,187,32,177,37,44,10,0,3,0.1535303776683087,u1qumXEGzdxzl0lM3Sjf9Q,Local Kitchen & Wine Merchant,"Local Kitchen & Wine Merchant - SOMA - San Francisco, CA",615,3.5,"Nightlife, Bars, Wine Bars, Restaurants, Italian, METADATA","330 1st St (between Folsom St & Guy Pl) San Francisco, CA 94105 Neighborhood: SOMA",Yes,$$,No,http://www.sf-local.com,(415) 777-4200,0

Great place to stay for a short trip to Chicago.  It is positioned right next to the park and art museum.  Within reasonable walking distance of most of the major downtown attractions.  I recommend taking a cab or the bus up to the top of the mile and walking it down, then grab a quick cab back and its worth the expense.  Especially if you go when Chicago is cold.... which is practically always!   The rooms are what you need them to be.  They are comfy, modern, and clean.  Spoil yourself and go downstairs for the breakfast buffet.  Just have them charge it to the room so you don't feel so guilty about it.   Flat screen tv in the room, ours was prob a 40 inch, maybe 45.  PC screen has free applications to cater to tourist needs and give you ideas if you run out of things to do.   BE ADVISED!  If you are taking a trip to Chicago...

1202,1/8/2010,0Fz1cnj5eMXHC8633fjQaw,"The World According to Noelle Allergic Girl's Guide to Life HOTEL We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for the majority of our December vacation. Valet, Front Desk, Concierge and Housekeeping staff were always friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a parlor suite that overlooked Grant Park- it was rather large and spacious. There were double doors that led to our suite. Upon entering one will note the bathroom on the left, walking a few more steps one will note the living room on the right with a large sofa, large comfy chair, coffee table and huge wet bar. The wet bar was full sized (with a sink and small fridge) something you would expect to see in someone's home. In the middle of the room was a large dresser with a huge television, built in the middle of the large dresser was a fridge w/ the hotel mini bar. On the left was our King bed and a few steps away from our bed was a large desk. Our room was rather larger. There were two heaters- one in our bedroom and the other in our sitting room. From our suite there were breathtakingly beautiful views of Grant Park and the Lake, everything was covered in a blanket of snow. They also had a cutesy gingerbread house not far from the Grand Ball room. Absolutely gorgeous Christmas Tree and other floral decorations throughout the hotel. RESTAURANT Upon our arrival we ordered room service. Apparently the menu we had in our room was old. We ordered burgers with blue cheese and dessert- apple tart and chocolate cake. The food came in a reasonable amount of time. I noticed our chocolate cake was not on our tray. When bringing this to the server's attention he said- ""No, you did not order chocolate cake."" My better half asked him to look at our ticket and low and behold we did order the chocolate cake. The server said sorry and left to get our cake. It took forever for the chocolate cake to arrive. Upon closer inspection of the apple tart- we noticed the tart portion was uncooked. We sent the apple tart back and ordered the apple pie. The apple pie was dropped off quickly. Upon careful inspection we noticed more than half the crust of the apple pie was missing. So we sent back the apple pie. They really did a mess-up job on the desserts. The customer service was lacking. We called room service to speak with a manager and the person who answered the phone said we were not allowed to speak to the manager. That is when we decided to call the front desk and speak with the general manager on duty. The GM took comped the entire dinner and was sorry for the problems we encountered. We decided to no longer order from room service. GIFT SHOP, ETC Medium sized filled with things that a traveler might forget to pack- floss, nail clippers, nail polish remover. They have a good selection of gifts that sport the name ""Chicago"". Customer service was friendly. They also have a FedEx located in the hotel. A WORD TO THE WISE For a hotel of this size you would expect free internet. That is not the case. Internet costs around $20.00 for a 24 hour period. Valet Parking is around $53 dollars a day.

1222,3/8/2008,OcCg2D,"I stayed here in mid-February 2008 for 6 nights and was mildly satisfied with my stay.  There were some really nice aspects of the hotel counterbalanced by some major flaws which can result in an average rating at best. To start with the pros.... Hotel was very cheap (approx $100 a night).  Granted, it was the off season but this rate was considerably cheaper than many other Chicago hotels in the same class.  The Hilton was also very clean, fairly upscale and in a great location. Now onto the negatives.... First and foremost, the room was EXTREMELY dry.  The Tunisian Desert would seem humid compared to our room.  Every morning began with an extremely dry throat and feelings of impending nosebleeds.  I drank more fluids than a marathoner running in Hell.  We called maintenance to check out the heating system but they were not able to do anything to correct the situation.  We eventually ended up sleeping with the heat off, windows open and water filling every container in the room (ice bucket, all the cups, sink, bathtub.... etc). The second major problem was with the housekeeping staff.  They do an excellent job cleaning the rooms and keeping the hotel in great shape but they can be a major annoyance.  Every morning (even on Sunday), we were awoken by knocks from housekeeping before 10:30 AM.  There were privacy dials on the doors instead of the standard ""Do Not Disturb"" signs but the housekeeping staff obviously pays no attention to these at all.  Even better was the constant peddling of coffee... On several mornings, we had knocks on the door to ask if we needed coffee.  Again, the privacy knob was turned and we did not call for the coffee.  By the end of the stay, we had a growing stack of coffee packages which we never touched. If it was not for these few major flaws, I could see giving this hotel a 4.5 out of 5 but the way things stand, a feel that a 2 star rating is generous.",2,0,0,0,N,NLrmde1QaLw3MFEbCzfemA,Jen MsBrewski B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",March 2009,18,28,6,8,3,7,6,13,1,0.021374045801526718,BnQEp1nas8D7HFCXBQprmw,Victory's Banner,"Victory's Banner - Roscoe Village - Chicago, IL",318,4.0,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Breakfast & Brunch, METADATA","2100 W Roscoe St (between Hoyne Ave & Hamilton Ave) Chicago, IL 60618 Neighborhood: Roscoe Village",Yes,$$,No,http://www.victorysbanner.com,(773) 665-0227,0

1232,1/16/2011,nxrDO38Ek-kxlt94TA6AIw,"(Just to preface this, I registered for Yelp just to write this review) We arrived at Victor Hotel shortly after doors opened (around 9:15 - 9:30pm) for their NYE party. There was a good sized line outside, but it couldn't have been more than 100 or so actually outside. We assumed we'd be in line for about 20 - 30 minutes top before we'd get in. Boy, were we wrong. We spent the first 20 minutes in line, only to find out that we actually had to pick up our tickets from another gentleman towards the front of the line. So we got out of line, made our way to the front, got our tickets, and got back in line towards the back. Some time passes and now it's about 10:30pm, and those of us in line are now becoming impatient. We've been in line for over an hour now, and the line doesn't seem to be moving. Finally, one of the gentleman managing the line informs us Victor Hotel will refund our tickets if we decide to leave and bring our tickets back the next day. I was willing to do this but our group had already spent quite a bit of time and money getting there (I'd spent $20 on cab fare just to get there and would have to do the same thing if I decided to come back for a refund the next day), so our group decided to wait it out in hopes we'd get in soon and start to enjoy our night. It began to rain...but we still waited it out since one of the employees informed us we'd be in within 15 - 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were finally in getting our coats checked. It's 11:00pm by now. I learned that they had one single person giving out tickets for coat check, and maybe another couple people actually hanging coats. That's right, for the hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance, they had only a few people managing the coat check process which was easily the biggest reason for the slow moving line. We make it into the main part of the club only to find a sea of people we'd have to wade through to get a drink. We found a small spot and decided to park it there and try to get drinks. That didn't happen. We waited another half hour before my girlfriend and I decided we'd had enough. We left at 11:30pm, after waiting in line for over an hour in the rain, waiting for a single drink another half hour, never receiving a single refreshment. We raced home in a cab hoping to get to Dominick's before it closed in order to get drink we had sought after the whole night. I got out of Dominick's at 11:59pm, just in time to celebrate the New Years with my girlfriend. We kissed in the parking lot of Dominick's, watching the fireworks being set off in the distance. Although not ideal, I was at least with the person I wanted to be with that night. ---- Here comes part 2. I thought I was done dealing with these folks, but I was wrong. I started receiving text messages from these guys a couple weeks later telling me to come back for specials. Needless to say, I was infuriated. I hadn't opted into any SMS communications, not to mention the messages they sent didn't include any instructions for opting out of this marketing bullshit. I searched around and found the service they were using to send out these messages (http://texthub.com/) and found the tiny little link in their footer allowed you to opt out of their messages.

1233,1/6/2011,cd3rpvMPR1vz98cjIYaQxw,"I kept trying to reassure myself that this place wouldn't be as bad as the reviews here made it to be, especially since we were paying for a ticket and it should be fairly exclusive, right? Wow, Yelp, you were sooooo right and I swear to never doubt you again. THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE (and yes, I am breaking internet etiquette to express this statement!) Spent almost $75 a person just to wait. Jokingly we said the club should be called ""The Line"" but honestly, we waited for almost every freaking thing we didn't even want to do anymore. We had an amazing dinner at Thalia Spice (which we also did last year because it was just THAT good), then got to the club around 10pm, thinking most of the line should be gone. Instead, we arrive to find not only is the general admission still waiting, but even the idiots who decided dropping $100s of dollars for VIP was a good idea were still outside. What was even better was their ""so-called"" tickets were business cards with little numbers written on the top - why did I pay so much money for your stupid business card when I could have just taken one, then write scribble on a corner like a third of the people that got in for free? We waited in line for 45 minutes even though we purchased tickets ahead of time. When people started complaining, throwing fits, and demanding refunds, suddenly the line was moving faster... Shocker. It moved so fast we had to then wait in line for drinks for at least 20 minutes (not necessarily a line, but more like a mass of bodies around the only two bars in the entire place). Brilliant idea to put only three bartenders at the larger bar on a night like NYE and one bartender at the bar near the bathroom, which of course smelled like a cess pool. I get that it's an open bar and the bartender really wants tips but it got ridiculous when the bartender only paid attention to people who flashed $20s and titties. Not necessarily in that order, either. No real surprise when people would order six drinks a round for only their consumption when finally given the attention. I myself ordered 4 Coronas for my wasted time. Then, time to climb over more bodies and oh yeah, did I mention the broken glass that littered the floor? I never saw a single staff member moving to clean it up. Nor any puke that random drunk girls decided to produce on the dance floor. Or even the guy that admitted to me in his drunken stupor that he pissed on the main bar because the bathroom was too gross to enter. How magical. So midnight toast, fine - that was well and dandy other than the fact that we didn't get our party favorites or champagne as was to be included in our price (never saw the appetizer that was supposed to be included either, but at that point, nothing surprised me about this crappy place); thankfully people started to leave after the ball dropped. People falling all over themselves, the music was decent at best, and then the DJ or some distant voice in the crowd announces it's last call at 1:30... at 1:32, two whole minutes later, the house lights come on and that same distant voice says the club was closing. Wow, I'm pretty sure the advertisement stated the club would close at 2am. I know I'm not drunk because I never made it back to the bar after hearing about urine possibly being under my shoes. So yet the final line for the coat check. A girl friend of mine was shoved while we waited by some drunken idiot, so she started to shove back just to defend herself. Suddenly, she's getting fondled by security and thrown out of the club while her sister is desperately trying to prevent her from being hurt by testosterone-driven perverts. They literally picked her up by her legs and held her in parts they should not have been touching. Fast-forward to her waiting out in the cold without her jacket because they won't let her back in and guess what I discover? Bleeding scratch marks all over her exposed back. She's too disoriented and intoxicated to care, but her sister is furious and blind with anger. The females of our party were frustrated and completely disappointed with the night, while the males of our party were inebriated and thought it was a riot just to see women fight, even if it was their own friends. Absolutely horrible for NYE. By the way, one of the females will also be writing the General Manager and I am urging my friend who was injured to look into charges, if possible.

Second, I've been there both Fridays and Saturdays and they seem to have a good selection of DJ's that DJ there on a regular basis. The ceiling in the main room is pretty high so the sound obviously is amplified there but the music selection is great so who cares. Plus, it's a bar so it's supposed to be loud? Third, their bartenders, both female and male, are attractive which I consider to be a huge plus and a draw. Who doesn't need eye candy when they go out to bars? Bartenders and servers were all very friendly and accommodating so that's a major add as well.

Don't ever go during NYE! fiancé and I attended your New Year's eve celebration and left feeling frustrated and disappointed. We arrived at the club at 10pm and ended waiting in line for 45 minutes. I even came to the club the night before to pick up my tickets so I could avoid the line. It wasn't until some guests waiting in line complained to Cameron that we were finally moved inside. Once inside, we ended up waiting in another long line for the bar, which took at least 45 minutes to get drinks. It was ridiculous to see one bartender on the side bar and three bartenders at the main bar serving over 700 people. The club was extremely crowded; there was hardly any space to move. Numerous times I shoved violently by other guests at the club; My fiancé was worried for my safety. The floor was wet and had assorted broken bottles and glasses on the floor. I understand it is New Year's eve and the place can get crowded. What added to the  disappointment was the number of people talking about getting in the club without buying tickets. I saw Cameron at the door handing out tickets without checking a list of people who had purchased them. I spent $150 for a set of tickets expecting to get according to your advertisement: ""complimentary passed hors d'oeuvres and appetizers...a midnight champagne toast...party favors and noise makers"".

1270,1/26/2011,KIJsx,"Some of my friends had gone to this place a couple of weeks ago to celebrate a birthday. They apparently had a good time, so when my bff asked me how this club was, I told her (based on my friends reviews) that it sounded like it was a fun club. Boy was I wrong! We went to celebrate my bff sister's birthday, on Saturday. We got there with another gf around 10:45. Parking was kind of difficult to find and valet was $12. Its a very shady neighborhood, full of warehouses and factories. The place is actually behind a meat packing place that my step-brother use to co-own and I worked there a summer when I was younger to earn a little bit of money. I was kind of surprised by the location of this ""club"". It looked like a place where you could be mugged or killed your body thrown in a dump or the river and you would never be heard from again! So we find parking about a block away walk there and there's a line waiting to get in, I assume there where about 20 people in front of us waiting to get in. It was freezing outside and there was ice on the sidewalk. I mean if the club managers know there's going to be girls going who are wearing heels. Wouldn't the smart thing be to throw some salt to melt the ice to prevent injury!? So were waiting, and waiting and waiting and the line moves about an inch. We continue waiting and waiting and waiting...Meanwhile our toes are beginning to hurt from the cold. Finally we make it just inside this little un-heated tent they had out there, at least the cold air won't hit us. We continue to wait and wait and wait.... In the meantime there's groups of people who just go talk to the bouncer and get in. That's fine we figure they probably bought one of they're expensive, watered down bottles. After half an hour of waiting and our toes freezing off, we start to question if this place will really be worth it. We contemplate leaving, but decide not to since we already waited this long. Half an hour later the bouncer decides only women can get in, we where the first ones behind a group of guys. So we finally get in, only to find we HAVE to check our coats in. which causes us to wait again because the coat check room is right by the entrance. Were inside its now about 11:45 and the place is half empty and there's more girls than guys standing around! Wth! why where they keeping us out in the freezing Chicago weather? Why did they only, eventually only let girls inside? And why was this place so freaking small!? I thought there would be a lower or upper level!? Its basically the main ""dance"" floor where the bar is on one side and tables and chairs on the other. And two smaller rooms, I guess for parties. But then again what did I expect if this place is behind a freaking meat packing factory!!! We left after about twenty minutes and 2 drinks later to find a place where we could really dance(La Pachanga) The only good thing was we didn't pay a cover because my friend forwarded me that get-in-the-club-free txt.

The weekend of our wedding was chaotic due to Chicago hitting record high temperature levels and causing havoc on the hotel's air conditioners. While there were moments of stress, significant praise is warranted for the special events director Sinisa and the head concierge Krista - always keeping their cool and ensuring that all of our guests received excellent service (including moving them to rooms with functioning a/c, and if this was not possible comping rooms at comparable hotels in the Magnificent Mile area).

Woke up at again around 9AM after a family was talking outside my door. Woke up again around 10AM to someone shuffling plastic bags. Sigh. Bring ear plugs. Just walking down the hall you can also hear people in the room talking. The doors might as well be made out of paper. Not no great things about the hotel: - soundproofing - 2 tiny elevators. Each can fit 6 people like sardines or 2-3 people with luggage. Staying on the 5th floor, I ended up taking the stairs for most of the trip - stairs are located on the 2nd floor. - the Audi car service is never able when you need it. For a 2 mile radius of travel, I can probably walk the distance in the time I'm waiting for the car. - toilet paper was a little over a full arm lengths away at an awkward distance. I ended up taking it off of its holder and putting it on the bath tub instead. - TV's sound goes in and out every now and then And the great: + Check out is at 2PM!! + good location near Michigan Ave, Trader Joes across the street, Walgreens another block down, and a small movie theater a block away. Then again, there are other hotels to choose from in this area too like Four Points by Sheraton across the street. + nice spacious one bedroom apts + nice shampoo and conditioner that makes lots of promises like non frizzy, volumizing, moisturizing, color protection, gluten free, etc + free wifi + brownie and cookie treats for turn-down service. + free water in the bedroom which is basically filtered tap water. I can't get over the taste of tap water in Chicago, but with a lot of ice it tastes great. There's a ice machine on the 4th floor. + comfortable couch + soft bed that just eats you up. I have to add another star JUST for the bed.

This place felt like a hotel that thinks it's all that, but in practice stinks like a wet fart.  We arrived promptly to check-in, and were told that we would have to wait for up to 2 hours before our room would be ready.  This was pretty inconvenient given the fact that we had solid plans for that evening already (dinner, concert) and really screwed up our evening mojo.  When we relayed our distaste over the delay to the concierge or whatever you call it, they offered no kind of consolation (free parking, etc.) other than 2 free drink tickets at their hotel bar.  We didn't have time to enjoy the drink because of our rush at this point. After returning from our otherwise excellent evening, we went back up to our room.  It's got this very funky design which was kinda cool, but the carpeting is this super thick red/maroon stuff that looks like it's just rife with problems that only a blacklight would reveal. The bed was pretty comfortable, minus the fact that it didn't even have a proper fitted sheet.  That's right, they just placed a sheet over the mattress, probably thinking, ""this won't be a problem as long as they don't move at all while they sleep"".  On top of that, the comforter was given the appearance of a duvet cover by sandwiching it between 2 plain sheets.  Did somebody forget to do the laundry or something? Ah, this would be a good time to mention that when we arrived back to the hotel from our evening out, we wanted to use our handy-dandy free drink tickets.  To our dismay, the bar was CLOSED.  At 11:30.  On a SATURDAY.  In CHICAGO.  Seriously?

We were checked into room 604, which my mother wasn't too happy about since she was afraid we would be disturbed in our sleep from traffic below - but we had nothing to worry about, since we slept comfortably all 4 nights, without hearing a single peep from outside (or the hallways).  The only noticeable sounds you might hear are from next door when they're taking a shower - and you only hear that if you're in the bathroom. I didn't have a problem with the tiny elevators, but they could be a little bit bigger and faster.  Our room (I say ""our"" because we noticed some rooms were bigger/smaller than others when we took a peek during turn-down service) was big enough for 3, minimal, simple, and modern, just like the rest of the hotel.  The bathroom was a bit small, but who cares?  'Cause the best part?  The James is amazingly, fantastically, awesomely CLEAN.  I've stayed in enough hotels to know that sometimes the maids get super lazy and don't give a shit about keeping the rooms clean.  But the housekeeping and turn-down service (delicious cookies every night!) at The James is top-notch. Since The James is a boutique hotel, the employees (specifically the doormen) recognized us and often greeted us by our names - which was very impressive.  There's a Trader Joe's across the street on one side, which is super convenient if you want to grab a quick snack, lunch, and/or dinner.  There are plenty of other restaurants near by such as Grand Lux Cafe (across the street), if you want something a bit more formal.  There's also a Marshall's, which came in super handy for us because by the third day, my mother wanted a pair of sneakers 'cause her feet were so tired from walking in heels.  And when it rained?  Marshall's was crowded 'cause everyone was trying to purchase an umbrella!  The James is also just a short block away from the Mag Mile.

1302,7/2/2011,Gc9gqnGHpZWpuUixpsFY,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire. This is my very first boutique hotel and quite honestly I don't know what to expect since I usually book hotels that are more well known or is part of a big hotel chain company.   Stayed only overnight but all I can say is.. WOWZERS. The James Hotel doesn't look that enticing from the outside; The hotel lobby isn't even that big or expensive looking..but don't let that fool you because what makes this hotel top notch is the quality of their service. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were instantly greeted by 2 staff. We came a bit early (about 9:20 am) hoping that we can leave some of our items since we had to go to Wrigley field to watch a game around 1pm. We didnt checked in yet but they accomodated our needs without any problems. While watching  batting practice, I received a call ( around 11-12pm) from one of their staff letting us know that our room is ready. (Checked in time is at 2:00 pm) So nice of them to contact us even if its not necessary, very caring and professional indeed. We got a double bed room. Love the sleek-ness and simplicity of the room, very modern and clean looking. The bed is just heaven... one of the best hotel beds ever. LOVE the bathroom products.. Kiehls products? YES PLEASE! Very lavish! Love the grapefruit lotion.. I don't usually hoard hotel items but I am this time! We also got 2 bathrobes with slippers.. not every big time hotels offer this, not even 5 star hotels will have this ready for you unless you asked for it. That night, my sister and I wanted to go out to eat but the weather didnt want to cooperate with us anymore, so we have no choice but to stay at the hotel and just try room service. I've had several room service at 5 star hotels but I got to say, this is possibly the best one I've ever had no joke. The food is absolutely delicious! Food is served from David Burke's Primehouse. I got a Classic filet mignon with mushrooms and basil whipped potatos... sooo freakin good. I forgot what my sister got but all I can remember is that her asiago truffled fries is ridiculous! I never thought room service dining would be this good. I wished our food came with a rolling tray instead, but I can't complain much about it. After our dinner someone knocked on our door and saw it was one of the housekeeping ladies. She was probably there for a turn down service but nonetheless, she still gave us cookies! Yay! :D Another thing that I absolutely like about this hotel, and this may not be matter for most people, is that the check-out time is around 2 p.m. YES, same time as check in and out.. FINALLY a hotel that have you stay for a full 24 hours! I just don't like hotels tryna get rid of you by 12 noon.. seriously.. I'm not a morning person, so that was an issue for me lol. One downside to this hotel though and I hate to say it is that the view is just horrible. We have a view of a old building with a scary looking dark alley on street view, feel like zombies are going to come out at night or something. Other than that everything is faboulous!

After one day on my four day trip, I have to say that this is the best hotel at which I've stayed in Chicago.

Well, let me modify that...I wasn't impressed with the decor, but what can you expect from an older (I can't believe 5 years is older in this category) boutique hotel. What I have really appreciated is the smaller touches. Keihl's (sp?) products, personalized, handwritten notes upon arrival, uber-friendly staff, great down pillow and crisp sheets, and loads of towels. I really can't find anything to complain about, except for that I'd love it if they offered a ""sleep' function on the remote control (can't fall asleep when I'm traveling and need background noise.) -- and they actually may offer that but I've been too slow to figure it out.

1306,9/13/2010,bCHyuHStzUKU8YjreZob8A,"5 billion stars for The James as my wedding venue. The James was an awesome venue.  It isn't your typical wedding venue with pastels and white linens and chair covers with bows and ribbons everywhere, it is more contemporary and has a modern, stylistic feel.  This is what my fiance and I wanted for our wedding, so the James was a perfect fit.  We were sold as soon as we saw the reception space which has lighting included (adds to the drama) and an incredible black and white mural of the Chicago skyline.  The food was incredible, too.  Many of our guests said that they'd never had a better meal at a wedding.  Receptions at the James are catered by David Burke's Prime, so the food is pretty spectacular (esp the filet mignon).  The cost was suprisingly reasonable for the fantastic quality and venue, especially when compared to other hotels in the area. The professionalism was great, I had pretty specific requests for how the room was to be set up, etc., and Sinisa and his team executed everything perfectly.  Before guests entered the reception dinner area, Sinisa took me, my husband, and my parents into the room so we could see how it loooked and it was dramatic and fantastic (very David Tutera-ish).  It was a nice touch.  The tasting was amazing, too.  We were treated very VIP-ish throughout the experience.  Responsiveness through email can be a little slow.  However, during the 1-3 weeks leading up to the wedding, responsiveness was right on point.  Email returns were within a few hours.  I suppose these are the most crucial times for communication, so that was greatly appreciated and all in all they did a great job coordinating and setting up/breaking down the event. Awesome things about The James as a wedding venue: (1) The food is AMAZING (2) The price was way lower than other hotels in the area (3) The absence of the typical hotel wedding feel (i.e. white poufy linens and pastel chair covers & bows everywhere...blech) (4) The James Club for an after party (seriously, this was pretty awesome and I loved that you can have late-night snacks there and play pool) (5) VIP feel of the overall experience (6) free upgrade to a pimped-out suite for the bride or another guest of choice (7) dramatic pinpoint lighting included....lighting is way expensive if you bring it in yourself, and having the lighting really added something extra All in all, an amazing, fantastic venue that was a pleasure to work with.  I definitely recommend The James to other brides in the future!  I wish I had another wedding to plan so I could work with them again!",5,4,2,0,N,OpgsSE58fv3EJ0q3WW-cSg,Megan D.,"Seattle, WA",February 2006,8,46,3,53,45,19,8,0,2,0.018898931799506986,6trnbmg16kiBqisN11lZUg,Saars Market Place Foods,"Saars Market Place Foods - Oak Harbor, WA",7,3.0,"Food, Grocery, METADATA","32199 State Route 20 Oak Harbor, WA 98277",Yes,$,None,http://www.marketplacefood.com/,(360) 675-3000,0

Side note: I love the luggage display by the elevators.   The rooms are fairly minimal but extremely comfortable.  We had a problem with the shower drain not draining.  Called the front desk.  POOF!

1312,9/6/2011,1NKwWcricx4zJ48,"So I just got married. Here. This weekend. Yup. I don't even want to tell you about it. I want to be selfish and keep all the memories to myself and think that no one else could POSSIBLY have as an amazing time as we did at The James. GAH--okay. I will tell you. Because I want all you brides-to-be out there to think outside the box. To let you know that you don't have to get married at some hoity-toity, over-the-top, been-there, done-that hotel downtown where they are going to offer you nothing but the same-old same-old. The James offered a wedding venue that was utterly and completely refreshing. First of all, the Great Room is a fantastically versatile space. We held our ceremony AND reception in it, and were able to manipulate the space to make it look completely and totally different for both events within the same evening. How? you may ask. Wellll....there are a couple things. First, they have skylights and pinspot lighting in the room--we opened the skylights for a more natural ceremony, but used the pinspots for a more elegant, warm reception. And this is big: the main wall of the room is covered by a large (now a dark, burnt orange) velvet curtain, and underneath lies a huge etched mural of the Chicago skyline and lakefront. Using the curtain for our ceremony allowed for a more solemn moment (as weddings are SERIOUS, ya'll) but the mural changed the feeling of the room completely for the reception, reminding you of the fun, modern space you were in. And the colors in the room are mostly neutral, allowing any gal set on magenta and chartreuse to not have her heart broken. Second--THE STAFF. Sinisa, the event coordinator for The James, is possibly the nicest man in the business I have ever met. He is so calm, so accommodating, and honestly, you feel like you've made a friend by the end of all the planning nonsense. The service staff were flawless, and the management were flexible and even friendly about it when we got behind schedule. Third--THE FOOD. C'mon people. Did you really think David Burke's Primehouse would do the catering?!? Um. Well. THEY DO. They will take your order (from the predetermined menu) at the table, and deliver the perfect steak/fish/veggie risotto to you JUST like you'd order in their amazing restaurant downstairs. COME ON. This is no joke. Other fantastical perks? The rooms, the concierge, The James Club for an afterparty (great space, too! We used the pool table for ping pong), and um. Well. Everything else you could possibly think of to be incredible when you're marrying the love of your life.

I really wish I would have done this - I think it would have made our wedding experience at The James so much better My overall impression of The James, after hosting our October wedding (which mind you was on a Sunday) here is that they are out to make money. Conferences obviously bring a larger profit for a hotel than a wedding does. The American Association of Opthamalogy's annual conference was in town over our wedding weekend, and The James did its best to accomodate conference goers with rooms before our out-of-town guests. And they were more concerned with the set-up of their events in the hotel over our wedding weekend than they were with ours. Our rehearsal was dreadful! They wouldn't let us use the room where we were hosting our ceremony/reception for our rehearsal because the conference was hosting a meeting! Obviously a conference meeting is so much more important than someone's wedding day?! We had to hold our rehearsal in this tiny side-room, and it really made the next day stressful and awkward because no one knew where to stand during the ceremony! The wedding coordinator also insisted on showing us how to cut the cake at our reception, so many of our pictures of this moment from our wedding have this person in them. Seriously, we can figure out how to cute our down cake, we didn't need this person micromanaging. They also screwed up my gift to  my parents. I called them and emailed them ahead of time about having them put my parent's hotel rooms for the weekend on our bill, and they couldn't even do this right! They ended up charging my parents instead of me, and to make things worse they charged their wrong credit card and it caused a huge mess with the bank on their end. Seriously, what kind of people do they have working at the front desk? My final rant about The James was how slow communciation was during the entire planning process. They would take weeks to get back to our emails and sometimes we had to stalk them to answer our questions by calling them! And we couldn't book our band until the last minute because they took forever to get back to us regarding our sound equipment questions. The whole experience wasn't all bad though - the James did surprise us by letting us use one of their penthouse rooms for the weekend. It is a gorgeous space! It was really fun for my bridesmaids and I to use this to get ready the morning and it made for great photos!

Maybe I'm hard to place when it comes to interior design.

The service here is fantastic, and that's what I live for.  I really didn't take advantage of it as much as I could have, but down in the lobby, I met some girls from Texas who had the concierge get them Oprah show tickets and waive their $40 cover charges at clubs.  Ha.  The doormen were GREAT.  So nice, always offered to give directions, on the ready to help us with anything and call us cabs.  Really really sweet guys, and they really made an effort to remember who we were. They have turndown service and leave a sweet baked treat on your pillow every night... and housekeeping comes twice everyday.  Excessive for some, but I like things clean.  The rooms are spacious--ours had a little nook for office work.  The bar was great--very well stocked, with the usual amenities and iPod dock, but also with actually good late night snacks (real munchie food) and martini glasses ready for use.  They always left a fresh bucket of ice for us everyday as well, which was very nice.  I think we got room service at some point, but I can't remember, so can't really comment on that.   There's also a really well-stocked gym downstairs.  It's a lot nicer and has more equipment than most hotel gyms.  Fresh towels, lemon water, etc.   Conveniently located in the center of Downtown.  It's right across the street from Trader Joe's, which was awesome.  We picked up champagne and wine there everyday.  Also not far from Second City, and 5 minutes from Blue Chicago (awesome blues club).

The lobby is smaller, but it is very stylish, elegant, and well-kept.  J-bar (the hotel bar) offers great Grey Goose cocktails at reasonable prices. The decor of the rooms is super modern, elegant, and comfortable.  The beds are piled with plush pillows and super soft bleach white cotton sheets and duvet covers which must be 600 thread count (yes!  no crusty bed spreads!  all cotton!). The service and amenities are phenomenal.  Room service is super fast.  If you ask for towels at 3 in the morning, someone will be there in a few minutes.  Details such as free New York Times newspapers, free office center usage (including a flat-screen Mac computer), free late check in, free access to the equally stylish gym, robes, and free top of the line toiletries  that you find at Neiman Marcus is what sets this hotel apart from the others. There is a chef concierge and a entertainment concierge.  Enough said.  They are more than willing to figure out your likes and dislikes to find out the best places for you.  They make last minute reservations for you at places where most people have to wait two weeks to get in. I stayed at this hotel on NYE for only 150 for a standard.  The room was spacious and had a nice office nook, a sexy red patent leather recliner chair, and a bar that boasted patron, grey goose, etc, with a lot of counter space.  The marble bathrooms provide superb luxury. The downfall:  the only mirror is in the bathroom, which makes it hard for a bunch of girls to get ready.  Lighting could be better.  Parking is 50 for valet or you're on your own with the public garage that charges you 17 dollars for the first 1/2 hour.",5,1,0,0,N,QETdbUeTjAz8UJ_B4zSq8g,angela m.,"Byron, IL",November 2010,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.004285714285714286,NppFKA3c9JbugFn9MYCbMA,Sunlight Cafe,"Sunlight Cafe - Roosevelt - Seattle, WA",162,3.5,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, METADATA","6403 Roosevelt Way NE (between 64th St & 65th St) Seattle, WA 98115 Neighborhood: Roosevelt",Yes,$,Free,http://sunlightcafevegetarian.com,(206) 522-9060,0

We also got exceptional service and smiles from poised doormen and even extremely happy housemaids! What a joy to stay somewhere where the staff feel proud as well! Their rooms were very well appointed, we LOVED the minibar with fun extras (naughty ones too!) and who doesn't love Keils's bath products.

And the 2nd thing was that the walls in the bathroom could have used a once over, there were lots of short black hairs on the gleaming white walls. I imagine from the person before us blow drying their hair. Again, nothing huge. We were extremely happy with the luxuriousness of the bed, the barcelona chair in room was immaculate.

1374,9/16/2012,0N5q1jULdWdA6JcSOShm9Q,"This is review of the N. State Street Embassy Suites in the heart of beautiful Chicago. It is based on my stay here from July 28 to August 3, 2012. The review is broken into categories. Location!Location! Location!: 4 stars     The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago on busy N. Street halfway between U.S. Cellular (Comisky) Park and Wrigley Field. It is convenient to public transit. The El runs underground along State Street. It is near to Chicago icons including the Magnificent Mile, The Chicago River, The Loop, and the Navy Pier. The nearby dining choices are commendable. They include Weber Grill (I rated it 4 stars), Rock Bottom Steak House (I rated it 3 stars), Pizanos Chicago Pizza (I rated it 4 stars), Pizzaria Uno, and a dictionary worth of others. Suites: Its a suite not a room-3&1/2 stars   Embassy Suites rents 2 room suites. They are spacious, yet not perfect. The Maids did a remarkable job maintaining the cleaniness of the room. The beds were comfortable. There are two beds in the master bedroom and a couch that converts to a bed in the secondary bedroom. The refrigerator allowed me to load up on healthy snacks from the nearby Trader Joe's.  Just like the two other Embassy Suites, I stayed in, bathroom ventilators were nonexistent. Being a suite, a closet is more justified than a cabinet. East-facing rooms have a natural alarm clock. Owing to the fact that the drapes fail to close all the way, I found myself rising with the sun. The suites shut out the noise from the adjacent room at the same time there is noise exposed from the adjacent suite into the secondary room. Amenities: This ain't Motel 6- 4 stars   Staying in Embassy Suites satisfies my vacation philosophy of coffee by day and alcohol by night. The Manager's Reception has got to be the greatest amenity happening in the hotel industry. From 5:30 to 7:30, the base floor of the atrium turns into an open bar. Drinks are unlimited, with the exception that you can only pick up one drink at a time due to state law. After 2 hours at the Manager's Reception, my stress was momentarily history.  In the morning Embassy Suites provides a freshly made breakfast buffet. And it is good. However, it gets crowded. The hotel gets taken over by guests carrying around plates of breakfast. In my case, I use the other breakfast amenity, the Starbuck's downstairs, and the Starbuck's stores within a couple blocks radius of the hotel.  For people wanting more than coffee and alcohol, there is a swimming pool and hot tub. The water temperature was satisfactory. They stay open to midnight. Nearby to the swimming pool is a gym.   In the atrium is a business center. I never failed to get a computer. The business center comes in handy on account of the fact that wifi is an extra charge and a high phone signal is sporadic. Conclusion: One more 4 star Embassy Suites.   Embassy Suites-a Hilton division- has yet to let me down. This is one more Embassy Suites that I recommend.",4,0,0,0,N,RdGgH2C655oklnPT3oZJ0A,Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",November 2006,90,999,13,514,192,119,86,15,7,0.46228597871355853,uLDWk4pSvGyso0sg_qeqsQ,Pizza Gourmet Express,"Pizza Gourmet Express - CLOSED - University Heights - San Diego, CA",123,4.0,"Restaurants, Pizza, METADATA","4615 Park Blvd (between Madison Ave & Spalding Pl) San Diego, CA 92116 Neighborhood: University Heights",Yes,$$,None,http://www.pizzagourmetexpress.com,(619) 546-7430,0

Five of us shared a room on a Friday night in May 2012.  As far as the room goes, beds are soft and comfy - I slept so well!!  Had everything we could need (hair dryer, fridge, table, couch, etc) except free internet.  Interesting room layout - windows overlook both the outside of the building and the walkways on the inside - a little strange, but understandable as the center of the building is filled with light secondary to the big atrium with skylights and a decorative fountain on the first floor that surrounds the seating for brunch. A nice bonus to the hotel - free drinks between 5:30 and 7:30 and a free breakfast in the AM.  The breakfast was delicious - made-to-order omelets, potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices.  Definitely a good deal for a big group like ours who were looking to relax and have a few drinks. The location is ideal.  We don't mind walking so we took a hike to Navy Pier, down the Magnificent Mile past the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building to Millennium Park and Buckingham Fountain, west to the Sears Tower, ending up at Giordano's (my favorite deep-dish pizza place in Chicago).  At night we went out on Hubbard Street, a place with many bars/clubs to choose from.  There are lots of restaurants nearby, making settling on a place for dinner difficult.  We settled on Volare as it's not a chain and people on Yelp love it.  :) Oh, and while the hotel parking is expensive (over $40 with no ins-and-outs), there was a small lot on the corner that let hotel guests park for up to 24 hours for only $25.  Nice deal, but so small that it probably can't be depended on to be available.

It's just like any other Embassy Suites, beautiful atrium, free cocktail hr, free hot continental breakfast, staff was nice, concierge was awesome and helpful-- all things great right? Well... The hotel slipped a letter under our door informing us of the $millions that they spent renovating the hotel and rooms... From the condition of our hotel, we could NOT tell. There were chips in the wall of the tub and there were spots of mildew, the room had a peculiar odor, the lighting in the bedroom was horrible and the A/C was loud and annoying. To top it off, we had some issues with billing. When you checkout, any hotel on this planet is supposed to provide you with a receipt with any possible charges that you are responsible for, KEYWORDs: Supposed To!!! But the gentleman at the front desk said that since my Mom was using her HHonors points ""Everything will be taken care of"", well, long story short, it wasn't and there were some ridiculous charges that they were throwing at us and all these issues could have been taken care of before we left but we had to deal with this issue weeks after we checked out, damn tards. Other than my 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, I have to say that the hotel is in an OK location. If you're coming to Chicago for the first time, I'd suggest something closer to Navy Pier or on the Loop because this was pretty far from all the tourist attractions. Other than Portillos, McDonalds and Walgreens, you pretty much have to take a cab or walk for miles to get to where you want to get to. Thankfully the concierge was AWESOME. Phillip was so nice and sweet and is the only saving grace for this 2-Star instead of 1-Star rating. He mentioned a tour, one of those Hop-On, Hop-Off tours that was WAY better than paying a cab fee. It was about $27 a person and it took you to all the tourist attractions. Love him! Return stay is not in our future, we will look to the other locations...

But if there's a reason for you to be in this ""a bit out of the way"" location, then this is a great option. It's nicer than the Hilton on the other side of the river and has more amenities than the Sofitel and Fairmont (also on the other side of the river). What I liked about this location that I hadn't previously anticipated was the proximity to Grant Park, the Bean, the Bridge, etc. Being a native Chicagoan, it's embarrassing that I hadn't been before...super cool and super easy walk there. Also, my hubby and kid joined me on this work trip, and they very much liked the proximity to the Children's museum at Navy Pier. There's also a load of great restaurants nearby. This is a conference hotel. So you know it's going to be big, have lots of amentities, and charge for all of them. We paid an additional $15/day for internet, oh well, charged it to work. Rediculous, yes, but standard for the big chains. We didn't park there, but I'm sure that's crazy expensive too. There's a Shula's in the hotel...not my favorite steak chain, but I brought some potato skins up to my room (not paying rediculous room service fees) and they were AWESOME. Even better than the recently departed Boston Blackies' version that used to be down the street. I also ate at the little burger place in the basement...perfect for a quick meal, had a cafeteria feel, easy with kids, reasonable, and served beer...perfect. The room. We had a great view of the river, it was big and comfortable, of course comfortable beds. Since we had a kid, they were very quick in delivering a crib and fridge for her baby food. And when we had a technical issue with the remote/TV, the technition was really sweet about explaining that you have to turn the TV ""on"" for the remote to work (without calling me a total moron). Only downside here was the two towels in the room, and flimsy towels they were. Added bonus, if you're a Starwood Preferred member, as I am, the concierge floor is awesome. It's a double decker room with huge windows serving breakfast, pre-dinner apps and after-dinner snacks and desserts. Free soda and waters all day long.

A slam dunk initial visit.  By July 29th I told her it was a go, and please send over the contracts.  We would love that room. Then I sent a couple more emails with the same request. Called every couple days.  No response. Finally on August 9th she said she'd send the contracts to me ASAP, what name would I like to have on the contracts. I told her mine. Next, no contact, no reply.  Emailed every few days...... called every couple days.......  finally got a hold of her on August 17th, she said she'd get the contracts completed and over to my by Friday (2 days away). Then no contact, no reply.  Emailed a couple more times.  Called several more times.  Left messages.  More messages.  Messages for her assistant.  Finally called her today- August 24th- guess what???  That room will be closed for a DOOR REPAIR the evening of October 5th- when our event will be held.  No can do. Seems to me that most hotels would figure out a door repair so that it wouldn't coincide with an evening thousands-of-dollars dollars reception.  Especially considering they had until October 5th to figure it out.  Guess that door has to be repaired that day, that evening. The room was lovely, my immediate reaction was that this was going to be a slam dunk.  I had to beg and beg and beg them for over a month to let me get a contract for this event so we could do business.  I don't know what the issue was that caused me to get such poor treatment, but this is how it happened.  I do event planning for my company all the time, and having to beg for one month to engage in a contract is not the norm.

I came into town with my daughter to see my parents who live outside of downtown so we thought we'd get a room downtown make it easy, see some museums and all that good stuff.  We found a ridiculously good price, below $200.  I've stayed at numerous 'high end' hotels and this is right up there, easily worth about $389 for the two bed room we had.   My overall ""five stars"" comes from the value per dollar.  The last time we were downtown we stayed at the Fairmont, which was an absolute joke for the price (small, useless lobby), nowhere to eat, ugly rooms without any function, it was sooooo overrated. However, not the case with the Sheraton.  AMAZING place, top to bottom.  The lobby is the best/biggest lobby I've ever seen in my life.  It has different sitting areas, some with ""coffee tables"" that are actually touch-screen games (chess, checkers, etc).  There is a nice sports bar right there... all with an amazing beautiful view of the river through the enormous windows (whereas the Fairmont is closed and dark).  This lobby is super open and inviting.  Note, though... the two ""you are here"" maps are wrong, their stickers are flipflopped, so finding the elevators was a bit of a task at first. Our room was great.  Super clean, good-sized, amazing view.  Flatscreen tv (which has become standard at this pricepoint these days), great sitting area by the window.  The beds were too comfortable... no joke, I couldn't wake up.   The location is perfect for walking around.  First of all, it's right on the river, you can't beat that.  And, it's a couple blocks from Navy Pier for the tourists in town staying here, but the pier has a great children's museum.  It's right off Michigan Avenue, the Wrigley building is right there (which is basically the heart of downtown).  This location doesn't get any better for seeing downtown. Eating.  There are a ton of restaurants on the grounds here, all seem to be great standalone places that happen to be in a hotel.  Yes, they are all a bit higher in price than tourist trap places, but the quality is great.  We had breakfast at the place downstairs... for $25, it was all you can eat buffet.  They serve regular breakfast but I'll agree with my parents (who are extremely cheap, btw) that it definitely was expensive, like $12 but a basic breakfast; couple eggs, toast).  But for $25 you get it all -- and it's all made fresh.  (Damn, I need to review that place now, if I can remember its name) Anyway... other than Vegas hotels, I couldn't remember a hotel having more to offer than this one.  I highly recommend it, especially if you can score a sub $200 deal like we did.",5,1,1,0,N,qPjXQPDRWUgLa36ecsR4tw,Ali Cat O.,"Bridgewater, NJ",September 2010,0,19,0,7,2,3,1,0,0,0.024967148488830485,0cI9X3aHSdGi7NR6ZiElCA,The Red Door,"The Red Door - Mission Hills - San Diego, CA",274,4.0,"Restaurants, American (New), METADATA","741 W Washington St (between Eagle St & 7th Ave) San Diego, CA 92103 Neighborhood: Mission Hills",Yes,$$,No,http://thereddoorsd.com,(619) 295-6000,0

The ""Towers"" has hosted me on more than one occasion for different conferences over the years. I've always found the staff gracious, friendly and professional. I will admit it's not a Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, and on a hotel scale that is the ONLY reason I would think to not give five stars, but for their hotel class, I'm very comfortable giving the five-star rating. The ""Towers"" is clean, well-appointed and has a great location on the river. You can walk everywhere. So what I am writing about today is the absolute ABOVE AND BEYOND service my boyfriend and I received from, yes, San Diego. ""San Diego"", you're asking? Yep. We decided to send his parents here (who live an hour away from in Indiana) as part of a wine and dine Chicago weekend as a combined anniversary/Christmas gift. I called the hotel ahead of time to tell them about this special couple and to ask if there was any way they would consider a room upgrade. **DISCLAIMER: Now I want to make something really clear here. There are times that hotels just do not have the ability or the room to give out upgrades. So please don't think you'll read my review and magically get upgrades just because you ask for one. It helps that this was Chicago in the winter, and thus there was more likelihood for upgrade availability. Well, I received a voicemail at my office from a lovely lady who let me know they would be upgrading my boyfriend's parents to a club level suite. On top of that they also informed me they would be giving them an anniversary amenity, and assured us everything would be great with their stay. They emailed the credit card authorization forms and got everything taken care of in advance of their arrival so all they had to do was RELAX! When my boyfriend's dad - who is an extremely even keeled man- called to let us know they had checked in, he was actually choked up! It is not about a ""club level suite"" or the amenity. It *IS* about making a very special couple know that they are just that - special. My written thank-you will be following, but I cannot stress enough that if you just ask nicely, even if you can't always be accommodated, the staff will do what they can to make you comfortable. While in Chicago I do have many options and several hotels I do absolutely enjoy. However, the ""Towers"" will be my home away from home of choice for not just talking the talk, but walking the walk.

This is a review from 2009 but I was not yelping then and I feel that it is important that other people know about my experience. I was booked along with two other rooms for a conference, I am a student and we were traveling in a group. I had a room with another girl and we were taking a nap in between panels when someone walked into our room. Luckily we were awake enough to realize someone was walking in the woman said sorry and promptly left the room. Me and my roommate wondering what the hell is going on went out into the lobby talked to the woman and apparently they gave her our room after being there for two nights. We went to the front desk quite pissed off and even though all three rooms were booked at the same time according to them we only booked our room for the two nights. So without even knowing that we left or that the room was cleaned up our room was given away. The woman at the front desk was a bitch to say the least. She acted as if it was our fault and made us feel grateful that we were not being kicked out of the hotel. I wanted to choke her. The situation was fixed but the fact that someone just waltzed into my room pisses me off. Next year this conference is again being held at a Sheraton, I plan on staying at a different hotel.

The employee who took my call assured me there was a shuttle and that it ran 24 hours - although this was contrary to the hotel's website, I took her word for it. Flash forward - I land at 11pm, am outrageously tired and navigate the terminal to find the shuttle service (which is quite a trek). No shuttle there. I call the hotel to ask if there's a schedule or something, and the woman on the phone laughs and says ""the shuttle stops running at 7:45pm."" Needless to say, I was not happy. Sheraton must have a sixth sense that involves knowledge that I like to write about things on Yelp, because when I checked in, they upgraded me for free to one of the fancier floors with a view of the lake. No free internet, though AND I still had to pay $12 a day for the gym (are you serious). Unlimited membership throughout your stay will set you back $20. The bed was very comfortable and climate control (aka making the room nice and toasty) was intuitive and functioned properly. As a New Yorker, I am pretty used to walking everywhere.

Continental breakfasts were a 2 stars ho hum...The bagels, pasteries, juices, etc are things you find in any hotel lobby.   Coffee was very dark roast.   Why people associate quality coffee with dark roast is beyond me.   I roast my own coffee beans, and roasting beyond the second crack of the beans destroys all the subtle flavors. Lunches were 4 stars and much better:   We had pork tenderloins, pot roasts, mac and cheese, numerous green salads, cooked veggies, tomato bisque, and a wide selection of desserts.   The apple pie here is one of the best I have tasted.  Not too sweet but the apple flavor dominated, not the sugar.   The pot roast was excellent.   Yes a comfort food, but they nailed it here.    Food was prepared well in nearly all cases, a couple of times there was a miss but there  was enough variety.   The misses?...surprisingly, the soups here are weak. The pre dinner appetizers were also 4 stars.   The entrees included shrimp scampi (with the very large cocktail shrimp, not the Red Lobster shrimp McMiniNuggets size), filet mignon medallions (quality of their beef is 5 stars...very tender even when rare),     Had roast lamb (it was tender and seasoned great), roast turkey breast, two types of risottos, a brie pastry ..a foot and a half in diameter, an assortment of grilled veggies, several types of finger food desserts, calimari, and on and on.     It started to come close to Wolfgang Pucks catering down the street, but no cigar. Dinner was also 4 star quality overall.   Salad was good not especially memorable.   The soup was a spicy scallop Asian fusion thing that was tepid.   Is that a new direction in Asian fusion or was it just sitting too long?   We had surf and turf, a white fish...that was overcooked and dry, but the beef filet about 1.5 inches thick was superbly cooked.  It was a cumin based, southwestern oriental flavor.   Again Asian fusion influence in the kitchen, and it was excellent.   It obviously was grilled correctly, charred and singed on the outside....uniformly medium rare on the inside....deep red but not raw....really well done.   The desserts were a mixture of different things...fruit compote, a tart, a scoop of ice cream coated with toasted coconut, almond mixture. Although the Sheraton kinda misses on the soups and fish, they do buy high quality beef here and it shows.  The pork and lamb were also prepared with expertise.    This is a real meatlovers place to go.",4,2,1,0,N,NTBo_QOmMX6O0G4QH7M9Zg,Mike P.,"Chicago, IL",October 2007,9,50,5,33,23,11,3,0,0,0.02736726874657909,pnew-Qex-VBK-I2GZHJcsw,Burger Lounge,"Burger Lounge - Little Italy - San Diego, CA",494,4.0,"Restaurants, Burgers, METADATA","1608 India St (between Cedar St & Date St) San Diego, CA 92101 Neighborhood: Little Italy",Yes,$$,No,http://www.burgerlounge.com,(619) 237-7878,0

I am not a complainer but I felt like everytime I turned around there was something to roll my eyes about with this hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived after a 12 hour car trip from Philly at around 12 am. We knew that places like this fill up quick and called to ensure that our room (that had been reserved 3 weeks prior) was kept even though we were getting there late- no problem. We arrive and they have no rooms w/ beds left...so they gave us a room w/ a sofa bed and told us they'd upgrade for the following night. The sofa bed had no sheets on it, there were no pillows in the room and no remote control for the t.v. OK. Called the front desk, asked for these items and waited. Waited some more. Called again. A guy came up with 1 pillow (when we asked for 2-not an unreasonable request) and sheets. 10 minutes later someone came with the remote. Next day they told us the room could not be upgraded so we were moved to a traditional room (lower then what we originally booked). We got back from doing our touristy stuff, got the keys for our new room and our luggage was nowhere to be found (they told us they would move it), so we had to call a couple of times and have it tracked down. To be fair they discounted us $150 dollars and sent up some free fruit and water(whopee). Not worth the mental hassle and time it took away from Chicago enjoyment.

Convention accommodations:  the exhibit room hall had a few issues.  As an attendee, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the layout or the noisy HVAC system that was above some of the break out ""rooms"" that were on the exhibit hall floor.  The ballrooms and river or lake rooms were neither hot nor cold, but sometimes the temperature and attention to detail (like the coffee running out) was a bit lacking.  Having to ride the labyrinth of escalators was also a bit trying -- but basically the staff was reasonably attentive to the needs of the convention goer. Rooms:  I had a 15th floor corner King.  It was clean, my housekeeping staff were quite helpful and mindful of my privacy and the view (facing east) of the ice laden river and vast expanse of the frozen lake was breathtaking.  Because I was under the weather for a good portion of my visit, I didn't get to go exploring or utilize the workout facility.  For this, I will need to return when the temperature is well above 25 degrees fahrenheit!  And next time, I hope to be up just a little bit higher.  Nonetheless, I had an auto club association rate that BEAT the rate negotiated for the convention, so I had no real complaints about what my money was being spent upon. Proximity to services:  I wheeled myself from the CTA station at Clark & Lake with ease - and found that the neighborhood had many of the basic necessities.  Particularly important was the closeness of the Walgreen's -- which when one feels like the bottom of an icy river covered with a burning inferno -- is a welcome sight! In hotel services:  I had breakfast room service -- which was pricey but decent portions.  Too bad I couldn't really taste anything!  Business center staff, concierge and front desk have the 411 on assisting the business traveler and the bellmen have the taxi queue dialed in so one didn't have to venture out into freezing weather and wait for very long.

Now on to the negatives... - Room feels old.  The linens reminded me of my grandparents linens from the 70s.  The bathroom was antiquated with old fixtures, decent shower. - Dirt in my bath tub.  Not sure why and it washed out fine, but seriously. - Ethernet cable didn't work.  I called to put in a request to fix it, went to get take-out and to the grocery store.  Got back about an hour later and no one had come by to fix it.  Called again and they sent someone up shortly, but you shouldn't have to call again. - O'Hare lost my luggage, I notified the bell man that they would be delivering my luggage over night.  He assured me they would leave me a message if it came letting me know it was in.  Wake up the next morning with no message, assume it has not been delivered.  Check on the airlines website and it says it was delivered overnight.  Sure enough, went downstairs and it was there.

However, it just didn't feel like a nice hotel (which, at the rate they charge, it really should be). I've stayed at Four Points which are nicer than this place in both hospitality and cleanliness. Let's talk about the hospitality. The front desk people here are RUDE! Almost downright insulting rude. The first day I came in to check in the guy at the front desk asked me in a very accusing way ""are you here to check in or what do you want?"". UHM why else would I be standing in the registration line? Then I asked if I could apply my Starwoods number to the stay and he said sure and handed me a Gold key. I was excited because sometimes conference don't let you apply your starwoods numbers to get credit. PLUS, I am one night away from Platinum and was excited to make Platinum. So off I go into my room. Like other reviewers said, no upgrades unless you're platinum. I didn't hear anything about a concierge level or ANY benefits that the hotel provided (probably because there are none that are free). NOBODY asked me if I needed help with my bags, nobody wished me a good day. Nobody told me where my conference registration was. And this is just check-in. Check out was worse. I got a voicemail saying I will be getting a bill under my door in the morning. I woke up at 8am, no bill. I went downstairs to check that I made platinum (I was one night away) and also to check out, and get a bill (I like to have a copy of these things). The woman at the front desk was terse and curt with me. She said that no, I was still Gold, that no points or stays will be added to my stay because it was a conference. Man, I wish the guy who checked in had told me that instead of getting my hopes up. She then said that she could not provide me with a bill of any sort because it was being paid for by the conference even though I know for a fact that extra expenses are not paid for by the conference. She offered no explanation and treated me with no respect. I left feeling very upset at not having made platinum after being such a long standing SPG member (and frequent traveler) and having offered no consolation. I asked where the Java Lounge storage room was and she said ""downstairs"". Well ladies and gentlemen, she was wrong. I finally found the luggage storage area which was not downstairs but was on the same level and was SCOLDED by a Sheraton staff member for not wearing my conference name tag. By now I was both upset at my conference and with Starwoods for providing such an upsetting experience. I know this review sounds more like ""I'm upset because I didn't make Platinum"" instead of ""This place sucks"" but I would say that there is a right way to approach customers and a wrong way to approach customers and I would say that the front desk and members of the staff here (cleaning staff excluded) were the rudest hotel staff members I have ever experienced at ANY Starwoods hotel. I thought for a minute it was because I'm a Southerner in Chicago but then realized that no, I have stayed at the W City Center in Chicago before and everyone who works there (from the guy who opens the door for you to the people who check you in) are more than accommodating, nice, and a fresh breath of air when you are away from home. I will end this review with a review on the catering here. The vegetarian options are good, the cookies are hard and way too huge, pound cake and any baked goods are always dry, and there is a wider variety of soda than water. Oh, and the beds were not comfortable. Please don't even book this place as your wedding hotel as you will probably be more upset than me with your experience.",1,1,1,0,N,NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,David Call Me Maybe K.,"Atlanta, GA",June 2007,552,932,270,4172,3495,3505,4275,20,112,0.47819394561313494,NZHO0p4oaw9JsG46z5T0DQ,Java Jones,"Java Jones - CLOSED - San Diego, CA",118,4.0,"Food, Coffee & Tea, METADATA","631 9th Ave (between G St & Market St) San Diego, CA 92101",Yes,$,Free,http://www.javajonescoffeehouse.com,(619) 696-9664,0

However, as a parent, and as a person who thinks customer service should be mandatory and not optional, I feel like I HAVE to warn others about this hotel. Not only is it not child friendly, but its not PEOPLE friendly. I arrived at this hotel on a cold morning with my mom, my daughter, and my heavy luggage. No one as at the door to help with our luggage, and the doors are not automatic. Im a pretty easy going gal, so I helped myself. When we get to the room, its very basic, to say the least. Brown walls, brown floor, no decorations. Just basic. I get ready to make a local phone call and see that its 1.75 , and an additional 50 cents (or around that) per min after the 1st thirty mins. I assumed local phone calls would be included in the $100+ bucks per night I was paying to stay there. The fridge is stocked with vodka and snicker bars. And when I say stocked, I mean good luck trying to put your food in. I suppose this is there cute little way of saying eat the food they supply??? The candy is $4.00 The vodka, I don't know. I ask an employee where I can find a microwave, so I can warm my daughters food. He appears annoyed and tells me to call the front desk. When I call, they inform me they can send me a microwave to rent for $25. I tell her no thanks, but I would like for someone to come and empty the vodka out the fridge. I worry that my very active and curious toddler may get hold of it. She says ok. One day later, no one has come, and I move it myself. When I asked for a tooth brush, im told that I cant pick it up at the front, but they will deliever it. It ends up being a 40 min delivery. I get no apology from the employee who finally brings me one. The employees are arrogant and rude, the food is overpriced, the company itself doesn't seem to respect its customers...

Well, it's the W hotel, which obviously means it's stylish, cool, trendy, all in once place with an exceptional location in Chi-town overlooking Lake Michigan. We were there in the winter so I can't speak for spending time outside the hotel facilities so we definitely took full advantage of the inside. The people at the lobby were super nice, the decor was fab-u-lous throughout and the actual hotel room was spacious, clean and had a very chic feel to it. We left as happy guests. The best part of the hotel is that it houses Wave restaurant which is like Mediterranean tapas and it's absolutely delicious and definitely cost effective. This 4 star hotel is a great location to stay for both tourists, locals and even if you're on business trips, the concierge will be friendly and polite and the bar is definitely worth checking out and if time allows, make a reservation at Wave.

Check in process was smooth, we had a wonderful room with a view of buildings across the street. Room was nicely furnished, flat screen, high beds, window shades between bedroom and bathroom. The room smelled nice and the furnishings were in a fine condition. We got a glimpse of the rooms with a view from the elevator waiting area - it looks our directly at a beautiful beach with Navy Pier to the right. I can imagine how amazing it must be to wake up with that view in the morning. It was raining on Friday night, we asked to use the hotel umbrella when we went out for dinner but apparently they were all out. The agent at the front desk offered us her personally umbrella but we declined (I think her name was Arianna - great service). We also had forgotten the charger for our iPhones, although they weren't able to send us one for our room, it was no problem to stop by the front desk and leave it there to charge in the back. We did that for 2 nights. The welcome desk was a little chaotic the two times we needed to speak to them, and when we did their attitude wasn't entirely pleasant. That was the only minor flaw to the hotel besides the unusually slow elevators that seemed to stop at every floor every time we needed to go to the lobby. We had plans all weekend, so didn't get to use the pool, restaurants or bars on site.  We rented a zip car for 2 hours for our little excursion on Hot Doug's on Saturday morning. The car was parked a block away in a lot, very convenient. Other times we took the Red line (Chicago), explored the city on foot, and at the end of the night we took the taxi to the hotel. The W Lakeshore is located a bit far from the river and Michigan Ave. but the lake view is simply breath taking.

1465,9/19/2012,ZLe,"I'd like to make a confession. I don't really like W hotels all that much, but I REALLY don't like this one. Whatever. Whenever... though personally, I'd like to put a little more emphasis on 'Whatever'. I don't like walking into what looks like a club with blasting music and $16 martinis in the morning. I don't like feeling like you have to be sexy at 8am, 2pm and 4:00am in the morning after you've been rained on all day/night and the concierge at W hotel has the nerve to recommend the Hangge-Uppe as a decent after hours bar... for that cruel joke I should actually give 1-star but I'll be kind regardless of what my ovulation cycle is telling me. I will say that I do enjoy the quirky rooms at most W locations, though I feel like this W is lacking the quirky and leaning more towards stuffy. I don't like being ignored by the bartender or being carded by the same one twice in less than hour after not moving seats. Never has there ever been a more invisible neon orange-haired person than at the W Lakeshore's bar. I know most people probably come here from out of town, but my experience was for a weekend-long and God-forsaken bachelorette party so I was more than non-plussed when I found out that parking here over the weekend would cost me close to $200... a price that I simply can't afford, and would refuse to pay for parking anywhere regardless. I ended up hitching a ride with the bride and husband-to-be so that worked out, but then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of paying what the room rate for this hotel is vs what you get. On a typical rainy, chilly and windy as f*ck Chicago day, I wouldn't consider the W Lakeshore to have much of a view. Looking out the windows to the stormy, grey Chicago days outside was like taking a photo of depression and charging people $400 a night to look at it. No thanks. Waiting for a cab at their cab stand was brutal. We basically had to add 15-20 minutes onto any of our travel times to accommodate the long lines here, and the car service they had was never available at any point from Thursday-Sunday, sooo don't count on trying to save any scratch or be able to take advantage of any of of the perks. The front desk told me that the best way to be able to get a reservation in with them was to come down a half hour before the concierge opens and wait in line to try and get a booking. Uhm, I don't know about you, but getting up and going down to the club atmosphere lobby at 7:30am and waiting in line for 30 minutes to ask for a ride. F*ck that noise. Oh and for the price of the room on weekend, I was expecting a bowling alley in there or something, not just 2 beds, very little room and a bathroom with ZERO privacy that actually has a window you can open to see people on the toilet.

1470,5/30/2012,r3F,"W hotels and ""child-friendly"" are two terms that don't normally go together.  Usually, the trendy euro vibe, techno music and stylish bar/lounge make it the kind of place that parents used to go to. However, this W is different.  The location next to Navy Pier and all of the child-friendly parks and activities in the neighborhood mean that parents with young kids flock here, especially on a holiday weekend.   The hotel itself seems to have an identity crisis about this. Others have mentioned the poor use of the rooftop - the event-only space that apparently used to be a great restaurant.  On the pool level, a great outdoor patio overlooking Ohio St Beach and Lake Michigan is poorly utilized with a small, lonely bar and a few high tables. Where are the lounge chairs and the music that would give it a Rio or Miami-style vibe? Instead, with a small grill serving hot dogs and burgers, it had a family cookout feel, and it shut down around 8 (perhaps because the kids needed to get to bed). Speaking of kid-friendly areas, the pool area has no hot tub, but comes with pool toys so that the young ones can have fun.  It's also difficult to get food and drink service there (apparently you have to pay a 20% service charge and a delivery fee if you want anything other than the kid friendly food and limited bar on the patio.) One more gripe - in the morning, hot water was iffy in the shower - maybe it's tough to get it all the way up to the 32 floor. With all that said, since I wasn't traveling with kids, you may wonder why this place gets 3 stars? The answer? The view from a room on a high floor is downright breathtaking - get a room with a lake view if at all possible. The view can stand toe-to-toe with any ocean view on a sunny day, and is well worth seeing for yourself. The room was laid out so that you could see the view from everywhere (including the shower). The peaceful beauty of it might even help soothe you after a day with the kids. If the W starts a family-friendly line, this might be ground zero. But for the single partiers, guys/ladies nights out or young couples, I say go for the other W - City Center.

Bliss soaps, shampoos and lotions in the bathroom. Its also a great way of trying out Bliss products instead of shelling out the 30 plus bucks. I am not a big fan of the whole wooden window thing that seperates it from the room. Couldn't they just use frosted glass like aloft??? Overall, the rooms are good.

There are a few things to know about this particular W. It's hip. Bumpin' hip. Sparkly top hip. The design choices while interesting, are maybe not the most functional. For instance, the shower is half enclosed by glass with no door so you get a wet floor unless you put a towel down. Also, there's a window on the wall that separates the bathroom and the bedroom which is only closed by wooden shutters (as is the door). If you happen to be staying with someone you're not, say, very comfortable with, you may find it difficult to.... well... shy kidneys, ok? Don't make me say it. The flat screen tv is great, the in-house DVD and iPod players are excellent touches and every room encourages a visit to the sky bar with a free drink card (hello, Mr. Blueberry Mojito). The space is gorgeous, with fresh flowers everywhere that scent the lobby remarkably well. The indoor pool is housed in a space which is a bit dark, but is adjacent to a lovely teak-floored outdoor patio with chaise lounges and a lovely view of the Lake.

I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of ""cool"". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ.

Since I live in the city, I only stayed over one of the three nights, but I spent the better part of those days in the W and it was quite nice. The first night's event was at Altitude which is the open space at the 33rd floor... The room is all windows with an astounding view of the lake as well as the city.  The ceiling was a little low, but again- the view made up for any nit-picky short comings. Even the elevator is a delight...or a party. It always smelled lovely in the elevator, which you don't realize how nice that is until you're crammed in with a flock of tourists... The elevator music was not your typical sleepy tunes- they were playing Peter, Bjorn & John and other hip anthems. The food was catered by the W and it was good. Not great, but really decent considering they were feeding more than 300 people. On the final night, I stayed over and the room was terrific. I probably had one of the few bad views (looking right out to a cement wall) but even that didn't take away from the overall pleasure of staying there. The bed was possibly as comfy, if not more, than mine at home, and the dcor, while sort of cheesily-trendy, was very comfortable. Also- no generic combined shampoo/conditioner and dry smelly soap...

1518,5/24/2011,CnxgFwN5KosWByOaJoAcag,"What a disappointment.  I recently became a Starwoods Reward Club member, so rather than stay at the Palmer House Hilton the way I usually do when I'm in Chicago, I decided to scout this place out instead.   It was raining miserably during the time I was here, so I didn't venture out around the property, but here are some observations about the hotel itself. High Points: *The concierge has a list of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel.  This is an excellent feature because room service for dinner is rather awful (see low points below). *The room itself is very comfortable and clean. *I lost an earring.  Housekeeping found it and placed it where I would see it.  I was very pleased. *They have a nice facility for a gym *They have an Acura car service that will take you around the city for free, as long as you sit through a 1 minute video on your ride and listen to the driver talk about the car and fill out a short survey.  (Service is available from noon-7pm only.) *Navy Pier looks like its in walking distance.  I could see it was close from a hotel window. Low Points: *Hotel room service is bad and expensive!.  I had the chicken pot pie for dinner which was just gross.  It was a lardy mess and not really a pie at all with the tiniest pieces of chicken and veggies almost like the kind that you would find in a can of condensed soup.  I also ordered a $12 slice of carrot cake, which for the price I hoped would be amazing and it was small and just 'meh bordering on not good.   *The shower kept changing temperature!!!  I took two showers while I was there, one long and one short (I know, TMI huh?). During the long shower the water temperature got cold at least 5 or 6 times.  And during the short shower at least a couple of times.  That is just plain old unacceptable! *They have a popular happy hour.  That in and of itself is a good thing, however, the bar is right next to the reception desk.  The music and crowd was so loud that I could not hear the front desk staff as I was checking in. *I got a double room when I asked for a King. * The hallways are noisy in the evenings, sounded like hotel staff. Other points: *They have a very interesting menu option: fresh fruit with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and......a disposable camera.  Enjoy! :)",2,1,0,2,N,QT-2Pei9XAZK0Wnx3S4JEQ,Kaila V.,"Wentzville, MO",August 2011,2,11,1,5,2,0,2,1,0,0.02576112412177986,Yxs3FuJLS2ls8Yx7Jwv9qw,The Mission,"The Mission - North Park - San Diego, CA",792,4.0,"Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Coffee & Tea, METADATA","2801 University Ave (between Idaho St & 28th St) San Diego, CA 92104 Neighborhood: North Park",Yes,$$,No,http://themissionsd.com,(619) 220-8992,0
1519,7/18/2007,fbGzM81X,"There were a lot of hotels I wanted to stay at in Chicago and finally decided with W @ Lakeshore. Great hotel, when I come back, I'll be here again. Intimate, plus and private. Love the minimalist designing of the hotel (and all W hotels). Book the hotel if...: if are young or ""feel younger"", into or somewhat into ""urban chic"", and you are plan to take advantage of the hotel's offerings. To book the room isn't that expensive but to take advantage of what the hotel offers, is. For example, their Whenever Wherever policy - you can basically get whatever you want, when you want it (like White Castle burgers at 3am delivered to you by the hotel staff). Rooms: made for couples. Don't plan on coming here with your family or if you do, get separate rooms. For example, there is no bathroom door. Rather, it is a sliding wood door that it not on rails (it's a ""casual-optional"" door and there is a wooden window from the bathroom to the bedroom that is meant to be kept open. LCD's in every room, minibar has everything you want from food to booze to hats to ""love packages"" (condoms, lube, mints and some other stuff). The toiletries are from Bliss so yeah, actual name brand stuff unlike most hotels since most top hotels have their ""exclusive"" brands but they don't mean anything because the dealer only deals to them; so it's actually generic). If you're crazy about spa, they have the Bliss spa experience. They have a great pool (indoor of course); it's open to all hotel guests so no need to do the spa if you don't want. They have a club/bar upstairs that has an AWESOME view of Chicago. If you're a hotel guest, just flash your card since there will be a line to get in on weekends. If you want feel pampered (and you are willing to spend the money for it), you  will have a great time here. You can also be discreet to and enjoy all the amenities. Friendly and very-knowing concierge desk. Since it's at Lakeshore, this part of the city is relatively quiet compared to the inner-city.

But, this is the W, and I expected a lot more out of you! There were some redeeming qualities...awesome Bliss toiletries (though on day 1 I was missing conditioner and lotion), great location (close to everything without being directly on Michigan), comfy beds. BUT...There were many problems. This is a Chicago hotel! Do the words ""form follows function"" mean anything to you people?! In W's attempt to make-over the Days Inn, common sense really went out the window. For starters, the bathroom?! WTF? if you want any privacy in your bathroom, don't stay here. Seriously, a sliding wood door with slits, and a ""what the hell is it doing here"" window cut-out with wooden shutters? No overhead fan? A shower without a full door? I had to use a towel just to keep the floor from being completely soaked. Also, no closet, just some shelving. While nice-looking, it was inefficient. It was weird putting my shoes in a drawer. The shelf for my suitcase is directly under the hangers, so when I go into my suitcase, I have clothes hanging, literally, in my face. Annoying. Also, there were some little things that, again at any other hotel wouldn't have been a big deal, but this is the W! For example, both mornings the free coffee was empty. Refilling involved me talking to 2 different people. Lobby (excuse me, ""Living Room"") is way too small for the traffic. Despite 5 stations for front desk clerks, I never saw more than 1 or 2 which resulted in long lines and a crowded lobby. Also, it's hard to forget this was a Days Inn...ugly-colored walls, ,and a ""This used to be a cheap hotel"" stench that just wouldn't go away. If you're going to drop a lot of money on a fancy Chicago hotel, I'd advise looking at other properties. If you want that ""W Experience"" try one in a different city.

1536,12/3/2009,HJtST4UMYL9SBi8rPra0Uw,"I am semi cross posting this with my review for the hotel's restaurant, Wave's, since the major issue of hotel security affects those staying at the hotel as well as dining here. I was recently robbed in the restaurant in the hotel's lobby.  My purse was tucked between my feet under the chair/table, and at some point during the meal, it was stolen.  We later realized that there was a man sitting behind me who had turned his chair around and leaned towards us, and we believe he used his foot or some kind of implement to drag my purse out from under the table unnoticed.  Pretty ridiculous, right?  This is the sort of thing that takes practice.   The hotel management was unhelpful to the point of being actively combative when I reported the theft.  I immediately filed a police report and was met with rudeness and a complete lack of assistance from any of the hotel management.  The security guard especially was purposefully rude, and when I complained about the treatment, as the victim of a crime, to the manager, all he would say was, ""I have no control over the behavior of the security team.""  Um, you are the manager of the hotel, and that does not make any sense.  We eventually got the security manager of the W City Center on the phone, who apologized profusely and began to actually help us, including taking down a description of the suspect from the people who had sat across from me and letting me know how to file a formal complaint with the hotel, which the hotel manager had completely neglected to do.  Even in a less trying situation, this customer service would have been unacceptable, but after being robbed in the hotel, in what now turns out to be a repeated occurrence, it became downright offensive.  It's too bad, because I had been a big fan of W properties, but I would never, ever come back to this restaurant OR hotel again.  Potential future visitors, consider this your official warning. After reporting this story to friends, I found out about several other women who had the exact same thing happen to them at this restaurant over the past year.  That sounds like a really bad pattern to me.  Since this has happened, the police and my insurance company's private investigator have confirmed that this hotel is a very common spot for robberies in Chicago.  The fact that the management evidently does not take this seriously is a huge problem.",1,4,0,0,N,odoKbBFczeBligA9Dz7xyg,S W.,"Herndon, VA",February 2009,0,17,1,10,4,4,0,0,0,0.012705530642750373,Gfv14ExXClMQb7vF_v8wsg,Risqué Café,"Risqué Café - Lakeview - Chicago, IL",123,2.5,"Nightlife, Bars, Pubs, Restaurants, Barbeque, METADATA","3419 N Clark St (between Roscoe St & Newport Ave) Chicago, IL 60657 Neighborhood: Lakeview",Yes,$$,None,http://www.risquechicago.com,(773) 525-7711,0

The service...well I'm not sure if people who work at the W know that they are in the service business. For some reason I find that most people who work there think you own them a thank you.

I arrived rather early and was told that my room was not ready yet, but they would call me my room was ready. Did I mention I was upgraded to one of their Fantastic Suites with a Lake View! SPG Platinum status rocks! I was out when I received a call back from the Welcome Desk (front desk) that my suite was ready. The suite on the 22nd floor overlooked Lake Michigan and Lakeshore Drive. I entered our suite to a large living room and desk. There was a 42"" flat screen television, sirius satellite radio, dvd player, and CD changer. The bedroom was to the left and the master bathroom was off to the side of the bedroom. The bathroom had Bliss bath products. The nice thing about this bathroom was that it had both a shower and a tub. Let me just say the shower was divine.   The bed is also wonderful too. I swear whenever I'm staying at the W it's so so difficult to get out of their plush signature bed. Another nice thing going on at the W's is the Acura experience. So what the heck is the Acura experience. To sum it up W Hotels and Acura have teamed up to offer hotel guests rides in new Acura's within a 3 mile radius of the hotel.

1567,1/20/2010,ZS5WThBFalWLMUjOEuTpFA,"I have stayed at the W (Lakeshore Drive) a handful of times, and I have never been disappointed. The staff is very polite, the rooms are well appointed, and the scene/atmosphere is very young and trendy. One of my favorite aspects of this hotel is a very very small thing, and  is something you might expect from the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton's and Peninsulas of Chicago. The W changes out their elevator rugs three times a day. In the morning it reads, Good Morning, in the afternoon, Good Afternoon, and in the evening, you guessed it, Good Evening. Like I said, this is a very minor detail, but in my opinion, it's the kind of detail that helps justify the price and set  the hotel apart from others. I would like to make a couple comments on some of the reviews I have read on this hotel. In regards to the Silver Wall at the hotels main entrance, I think this is a lot less tacky/gaudy then a lot of other reviewers because I believe it is one, intentional and two, a good fit with the hotels overall theme. I would agree that, if a Four Seasons had this outside of its front doors that yes, it would be tacky, but the W is all about young people having a good time and in my opinion, it works. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is not a family hotel.... not that families are unwelcome, but I would be a little uncomfortable with one of my parents going to the bathroom and/or taking a shower in a bathroom without an actual door. The beds in the rooms are very comfortable. They have that softness that you know you couldn't sleep on every night, but is heaven for a night or two. The gym at the W is not great, but does have enough equipment to get the job done. I have not been to the spa, but I have heard good things. The lobby bar and the Whiskey Bar upstairs (great view) are both great, and get very crowded on the weekends and are an awesome spot to spend your night or stop in for a nightcap before you head to your room. Overall, I like this hotel and will definitely return, if you are looking for a fun hotel to stay at, the W is one of the best choices in Chicago.",4,1,1,0,N,ocdeYQxllErpY-tsKeMDFA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",July 2010,6,4,0,7,1,5,0,3,0,0.004860267314702308,WDWRvyh62RSmLRPnTOwOmA,Annie's Parlour,"Annie's Parlour - University - Minneapolis, MN",86,3.5,"Restaurants, Burgers, METADATA","313 14th Ave SE Minneapolis, MN 55414 Neighborhood: University",Yes,$,None,None,(612) 379-0744,0

Nice decor, friendly people, music was great ,a really nice ambiance. Then I went to my room. It was OK I guess. Nothing extravagant but what is up with the bathroom? It has a sliding door that you can't lock and it's made of wood. Then there is a sliding wood window. So if you are squatting to use the bathroom the person outside of the bathroom just slides the window open and peek a boo....they see you! Then it's not like your typical hotel where you will find a bible in the drawer. Nope.... you'll find condoms to purchase and a $13 romantic CD. There is no coffee in the room for your morning coffee. Room service is way overpriced, definitely did not order room service. This hotel is way over prices honestly. I stood there and usually I will park at the hotel and get my ticket validated because I am a guest....nope...$55 when I got my car back for a 24 hour stay. Now lets talk about what happened at night. The elevator door opened at the Lobby at 11:30pm and the smell of weed hit me in the face. There is a lounge/club on the 8th floor that everyone was riding the elevator to get to. It is tiny but yet hundreds of people were going there, way over booked and the people that were going there were all stoned. I guess I had a different impression of this hotel. It is in a classy neighborhood so I did not expect all the craziness that went on that night to be allowed there. I was even surprised when I went to the front desk there were 3 guys chipping in money to get a room. They were putting in $1100.00 for a room, they were arguing because they didn't have enough money and needed to go out to the car to get more. See I didn't even know you can get a room paying cash, I thought a credit card was always required.

So I was now out $1200!!!! yup and I'm a teacher so you know I ain't got no money. The amount we paid ahead was $500 for two nights. Then suddenly we were charged another $700. Eventually it was all taken care of after many phone calls and much frustration.

I had exchanged emails with both the Direct of Group Sales & Catering, as well as the Wedding Specialist, and had an appointment to meet the Wedding Specialist and see the space last week.  Unfortunately, I was stood up.  I arrived 5 minutes early for the appointment and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes until giving up and leaving.  The very nice Concierge did her best to try to track down the Wedding Specialist to no avail.  After 30 minutes of waiting, another employee physically went to find her and came back to say, sorry she's in a tasting.  I'm not sure if she was double booked (she confirmed my appointment the night before) or if the previous appointment ran over, but there's no reason she couldn't have sent word to the lobby with her apologies and/or asked someone else to show me the space.  What's even worse is that 9 days later, I have yet to hear from her with an explanation, much less an apology.  I also contacted the Direct of Group Sales & Catering explaining my disappointment 7 days ago and have not heard from her either.  If this is the way they treat people during the sales process for a pricey event, I'd hate to see how they treat people who are already under contract.",1,0,0,0,N,QxHpSN-ZmbmfbSh13b3ELg,Joseph Joey H.,"Highland Park, IL",January 2011,4,21,0,9,4,3,1,0,0,0.03286384976525822,e6f8CiTLhFbcG3akdyNu5w,Jimmy John's,"Jimmy John's - Kosciusko - St Louis, MO",11,3.5,"Restaurants, Sandwiches, METADATA","1631 South Broadway St Louis, MO 63104 Neighborhood: Kosciusko",Yes,$,None,http://www.jimmyjohns.com,(314) 621-9000,0

I am cool with that, I am hip with it. ;-0 The staff actually were very helpful, patient, and eager to answer your questions...so that was a plus. Also a plus was that they kept part of that beautiful lobby/elevator area not as renovated, which looked great. The rooms were ok, clean, newly renovated (most of them), so the decor was nice. Be ready for the reminders that you are in a Hard Rock hotel, so eg guitar embroidered on pillowcase, posters of artists around the room, and such. In our bathroom, David Bowie watched me brush my teeth, so that was, well, different. Two cool factors, and even then, other than location, the hotel was just ok: every floor represents a different artist and has a piece of their memorabilia.  That provided a little entertainment for us. (We were on the Cheap Trick floor, if you ask the front desk they have a whole list.)

We also asked for a guitar during check in but were then told that they were doing inventory and didn't have any  left. Then to our surprise there was a knock at our door and one of the bellman brought one up to us so we could rock out. We opted for the free guitar lessons on the TV, but there was no information on how we could access them, we had to call the front desk to find out what we had to do. Once we got on the correct channel, it was just completely blank. I don't know if it was because we missed the time (it only happens every 30 minutes) or whoever told us how to get to it misinformed us. Either way we rocked out for a little while and then we had to get back to our schedule. Either way it is a pretty nice idea and really fun. The only downside to the room is that the windows (although huge) are REALLY drafty,  we kept some of our leftovers from a restaurant on the window sill and it was kept nice and cold--that was how drafty it was! So we had to turn the temperature way up to make it actually feel like it was 73 degrees inside. Good think they had nice huge thick curtains to block some of the draft. They gave us free coupons for a drink at their downstairs bar which unfortunately we didn't get to use. But as we were in and out of the hotel between 8pm-2am , it was packed and poppin like any other club off the street. Pretty sure I saw a couple making out on one of the couches in the bar...!

Here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be ""COOL"". Well it wasn't.

Cardio machines have  individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Café. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool, and yes I knew this when I made the reservation.

We giddily took the elevator up to our room, impressed with the all mirrored elevators and the white, European, short, skinny, boy  with a huge blonde affro that stood silently and pretentiously with us (undoubtedly both wondering if he was someone famous). Our room was on the 17th floor. Each floor is a different theme, we were on the Annie Lennox floor (perhaps we'll have sweet dreams we pondered). The view from the room was awesome, overlooking the river and part of north Michigan Ave. The room itself was a view to take in with plush beds, tons of mirrors, and fun modern furniture and plasma TV. The bathrooms felt clean and new. Needless to say, later that night, we had a lot of fun having some pre going out drinks. We had to resort to drinking in our room because the Base Bar within the hotel was ridiculously priced. We also had too much fun travelling to each floor to check out the different themes and memorabilia that was on display. When it was time to go out, the doorman helped us hail a cab, very friendly. Upon returning at night, we fell into a blissful sleep on the most comfy bed I have slept in in a long time.

I love Chicago architecture but there are many architecturally significant buildings in the city and its not like the hotel and its decor reflected any of the buildings stylings.... so it really has nothing to do with the hotel. BUT I liked the decor. Of both the room, lobby and bar area. Very sleek and modern. Loved the gray-purple walls in our room. The minimalist decor. The meant-to-look-expensive Warhol-esque rock-star images were cheesy but acceptable. Color-scheme - thumbs up. Aveda bathroom products - good job. Great bed and lots of extra pillows in the closet - rock n roll. The curtains definitely kept the morning light out - but, the rooms were not quite soundproof (from the bed, which was some distance from the door, I could hear the elevator and neighboring rooms' doors opening and closing - strange, not too mention light Saturday AM traffic). I laughed at the outrageous prices found while purusing the room-delivery menu and the mini-fridge items. Not like I was surprised. I just feel bad for the people (i.e. the out-of-towners up late night) who are stuck having to pay for all these things. (Whereas other guests may know there way around the loop or not be intimidated searching for a local convenience store). $3 for a can of pop. $7 for a bottle of designer water. etc etc. Good god, how horrible.

You'll know what I mean.   The location is smack dab in the middle of where all our activities were.  Just a short walk to Taste of Chicago and other interesting sites.  We reserved the entire 32nd floor which was compromised of 3 suites.  The Hard Rock did their best to renovate the rooms and to make them contemporary.  But yet there was no air blower/fan in the bathroom which could make for a stinky situation sharing 1 bathroom with several dudes.  Answer to the problem....can of Fe-breeze saves the day!  Other than that, we had everything we needed with modern comforts.  The views from our suites were simply spectacular, amazing, magnificent, you get the idea. I was a little turned off to see so many spider webs outside our window however.  But what can you do...it's an older building and we were after all on the 32nd floor.  I'm amazed now how technology has changed.  Case in point the mini bar.  They have this thing rigged so that it actually measures the weight of all the bottles in the fridge.  So in other words, I was thinking how I can swipe a bottle of liquor with a bag of sand ...a la Indiana Jones style..... Concierge service was exemplary and they helped us with any questions or situations that we had.  I should have stayed one more night with my friends, cuz apparently they met up with Snoop Dogg at the hotel on the day I flew out.....F*Ker's....

It was very relaxing. Aveda products in the bathrooms, big plus for me. I love Aveda. We ordered a banana split and some wine that night. We ended up with a full tray of food. The only problem? While we got a great surprise with all this stuff, they forgot the banana split....and my husband didn't see the note (thanking us for returning, and letting us know that some of the items were as thanks for coming back) so he thought the whole order was wrong. A bit of a miscommunication there, but all was well. My only other comment would be the TV and its reception. While I don't expect every hotel to have some HD tvs in there, the reception could at least be clear. The reception there was all fuzzy, almost like we were watching tv with the old bunny ears. So, a HUGE improvement from the 1st  visit....all in all, a good visit to the Hard Rock.",4,0,0,0,N,rZRCEAy-xv7TwDstUliTnA,Deann WHAT'S VOLUME CONTROL?

1614,10/19/2007,V-EzAJq-HZD0xGuClzQkwA,"REVISED RATING: 2 stars (3 stars too misleading) This place gets a merciful 3-star rating as it minimally meets ""decent.""  If I factor-in overall cost & value (even at $189 for a $799/night room), the rating would drop to 1 star. Cost/value-wise, this is by far the CRAPPIEST hotel I've ever stayed in, and beyond bragging rights of saying you've done the Hard Rock downtown Chicago, there is no reason to choose this hotel when so many others in the city offer TRUE luxury, comfort, and superior amenities for LE$$. Frankly, I've stayed in $89/night hotels that easily blow this one away (and I say that with no exaggeration and based on my staying in Hard Rock's very BEST rooms). My Review: LOBBY LEVEL - 4 STARS: The lobby decor is close to being top-notch - the flat screens by the elevators make for an exceptionally nice touch. The lobby also houses the Base Bar, which becomes a happening spot late evenings and on weekends. (See Base Bar review for more info).  I only wish they had given as much attention to the rooms respective to concept and design. THE ROOMS - 2 STARS (that's very generous): This is where the aesthetics, quality, and prestige fall WAY short.   During all my stays here, I've been fortunate enough to get $500-$799/night king rooms/suites on the limited access 34th floor discounted to $180-200. (How? Booked through http://Priceline.com, then called the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and asked for a complimentary upgrade to the top floor. This works for most hotels, as well as cruise ship cabins - Try It). At first glance, rooms appear to be ""decent"" with the beds being the focal point, visually promising to be soft, plush, and comfy; however, under the deceptively attractive signature Hard Rock bedding, you will find dated, not-so-comfortable firm spring mattresses. Also, the ""feather beds"" the website and brochures rave about are little more than thin comforters.   Hard Rock should really look into upgrading to memory foam or adjustable air-bladder mattresses, like Select Comfort, if they hope to charge an average of $350 per night and expect return guests.  This is the new standard of comfort...even the Raddisons of suburbia have them. The bad news doesn't end with the beds. As you begin to explore the ""amenities"" of the room, noting the Rock-n-Roll theme in the art on the wall and bedsheets, you begin noticing a second theme: FAKE Nothing appealing to your senses is truly what it appears to be when closely examined here. For example, the dressers appear to be made of rare ""Zebra"" wood, but under closer scrutiny are in fact made of compressed wood with zebra wood patterned formica veneers and components of impact resistant plastic. Oh, and the cool-looking trendy single-seat chairs are in fact cheap office-grade furniture upholstered in uncomfortably hard gold/tan vinyl snake/alligator print. Since no one can possibly sit on these chairs for more  than 5 painful minutes at a time, they will undoubtedly last forever! The living room table is cheaper yet! (Look closely at chairs & coffee table in pics above). And the carpet! Before you walk into the room, it looks like standard hotel carpet, but step in and you can almost see your shoes wincing with every step. Take your shoes off and what you feel is harsh industrial strength carpet ""pile""...AH-HA! Now you know why your shoes protested so!  No doubt, this carpet was built for longevity, not comfort...and will be around long after we've journeyed to the other side. THE BATHROOMS - 3 Stars -  Looks like they put 85% of the room budgets (which must not have been a lot to start with) into the bathrooms, which are fairly large and decently appointed with stainless fixtures, tiled floors, and Rock-n-roll pop art. *VERY standard hotel bathroom for NON-standard pricing? Hmmm.... I guess I shouldn't complain too much since I've only ever paid 25-50% of the regular room rates, but even at those prices I couldn't help but wish I were somewhere else like in a Regency Club level room at the Hyatt downtown - now THOSE rooms are TRULY luxurious. RECOMMENDATION: My advice is do the Hard Rock for the experience and bragging rights, but only for ONE night. The other nights, book your stay at Sofitel, Swissotel, W Hotel, or Hyatt Regency (Regency Club floor - limited access uppermost guest floor). All these hotels come with Select Comfort, memory foam, or pillow-top mattresses, thick down-filled feather beds,  REAL WOOD FURNITURE, soft carpet, AMAZING VIEWS from upper-level guest floors, and spared no expense respective to design, decor, and amenities!  They are also less than the Hard Rock's version of the same rooms. Expect $180-$400/night (Priceline/Hotwire/Travelocity) depending on advanced booking and season.

1622,5/27/2010,yaSLwvjnnP,"Let's be clear about this: I hate the Eighties. Perhaps I'm bitter because I officially did not get laid, even once, during that entire decade. The closest I came to actual sexual intercourse was watching old Lita Ford dry-hump her guitar on MTV. Granted, I was a teenager, but I still haven't forgiven Nancy Reagan for my unintended, decade-long abstinence. So, when I checked into my Eighties retro-styled hotel room for a weekend at the Hard Rock Hotel, my reaction was pure horror. Purple walls. Smoked mirrors. The image of John and Yoko staring at you in the bathroom. (At least, it wasn't Ringo.) I can only describe it as Miami Vice meets Sid Vicious. It's kind of room you imagine some coked-up minor record producer would try to hide a dead groupie. Hideous stuff. Putting aside my unresolved feelings of inferiority which were manifested in the 1980's....the rest of the hotel was surprisingly cool. There is definitely a rock-star theme going on throughout the premises, but it's less tacky than you might think. They actually managed some restraint. Patterned, rock star leather was to be found on all possible surfaces that could benefit from patterned, rock star leather. Their idea of ""elevator music"" is Beck, Bob Marley, The Killers, etc...a fun novelty. The gym facilities were genuine rock star quality as well. You could just envision a Rob Halford down there, working out his quads, in leather chaps. We entered the lobby on Sunday evening and were greeted by a ""celebrity"" bingo tourney, with an Amy Winehouse impersonator, cussing loudly at the mic....funny! Outside the elevators on our floor was Brian Johnson's (of AC/DC) stage outfit on display, complete with autographed white sneakers and guitar. You don't find shit like that at The Drake. What really won me over was the free guitar rentals. Yes, they will rent you an electric or acoustic guitar of your choice (nice ones, too!) to keep in your room for your entire stay. My poor wife...she thought a weekend in Chicago would provide her a few days of relief from my incessant fretboard noodlings. Give me a new guitar to play with, and I am like an infant. (The guitar rental form required the signature of the ""Artist's Name:_____"". That was a wildly pretentious moment. My guitar-playing is a lot of things, but ""art"" is not one of them.) Overall, there are certainly more refined and stylish hotel options on Michigan Ave to choose from. This would not even come close to being my first choice.

1640,7/2/2010,DaZX-4b4b,"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews on here but we (the Mrs. and I) stayed here for 5 nights. She was there on business and I tagged along. We got a much better rate than the host hotel around the corner. Pros: great location. Close to major train stations. Bar has some decent craft beer (local selections). You can check out a guitar and Line 6 pod and rock out in your room. Our room had a pretty nice view. Cold A/C. Nice big TV with decent channels. Comfortable king size bed. Many food options across the street (although we didn't see them until our last day because they're inside a mall like area). Giordano's is across the street. Close to the river. Walgreen's across the street. The staff was overall pretty nice except one concierge. But I don't like tipping a guy because he handed me a map. If he got me some awesome restaurant reservations or something, yes, I will tip you. Maybe that's why he wasn't the friendliest the other couple of times I asked him simple questions that took none of his time and didn't require the use of any outside resources. I never understood the whole tipping thing. I'm not rich. I don't get tipped to do my job. Waiters are different. I tip them. Cons: While the walls are thick and we couldn't hear our neighbor's TV or talking, the door to the room lets a lot of noise in.  The shower has a  kind of half glass panel for a ""door"". You have to reach into the shower and get drenched in cold water to turn it on and then the other half where there is no glass allows water to get all over the entire bathroom floor. I understand wanting to be modern or whatever but it was ridiculous. The closet was a little small and cumbersome. The door to it would not stay open.  No refrigeration, the minifridge is a weight sensor activated mini bar. We had to put our waters and beer on ice in a plastic bag lined trash can because we all know ice buckets hold next to nothing. Internet in the room is overpriced.

My room was very trendy and up to date with modern fixtures and very clever use of space.

1657,2/2/2011,Qwnz3A0s8cVOyJO68wgWuw,"Chicago's Essx Inn was the perfect hotel for my boyfriend and I on our first trip to Chicago. We stayed for a long weekend and needed a cheap hotel that was on Michigan Ave (as to have easy access to all the sights). We checked in very late (almost midnight on a Thursday) and were still greeted as if it were a bright and sunny summer day. Our room was a little on the small side, but last time I checked the purpose of a hotel room is to sleep, change clothes, nap, and shower. This room was definitely adequate, but not 5-star quality. The bathroom was a bit small... especially the sink! I could put my hand over the sink and it could easily span the diameter. The light in the toilet/shower part of the bathroom was pretty dim, but they do have one of those timed heated lights to turn on if you'd like. The features in the room itself included a nicely sized mini-fridge, a flat-screen TV with plenty of channels (including many HBO channels, too), and a heater. The heat system is a radiator, and although it has an ""auto""/""manual""/""off"" switch, when it turns on to heat up the room, it made a loud clanking noise that all of us who have ever had radiators and gas heat are very familiar with. We would keep the heat on during the day while we were out and shut it off at night. The room was very very comfy (not cold at all) even when it was below freezing outside. The pool and fitness area is one of the best I've ever been to at a hotel. The pool has multiple lanes for swimming laps and goes from 3 feet to 8 feet deep. It isn't very cold, so in the winter (when we were there) it was very refreshing. There is also a lifeguard on staff, which many hotels don't have. There is a dry sauna, but no hot tub. The fitness room has a number of cardio machines, weight equipment, mats, and stability balls, along with TVs. The hotel has free continental breakfast on weekday mornings, a restaurant on the first floor (although it was being renovated during my stay), and a free shuttle bus that takes you all the way up Michigan Ave to downtown (by the John Hancock Tower, etc.). We didn't use the shuttle because location of the hotel is fantastic. There are lots of bars in the area, a few restaurants, but when we wanted to go to any of the touristy stuff (Millenium Park, Art Institute, Chinatown) we would just walk. We even walked from the hotel all the way downtown and then to Navy Pier! It was a pretty long walk, but that's city life for you! And if walking isn't your thing, there are a number of subway and Metra light rail stops nearby. It took us 5 minutes to walk to a Metra light rail stop to go south to the Museum of Science and Industry. So easy!

We had a fantastic view of Grant Park, museums and the lake. I would get this room again for the view! It doesn't happen much in Chicago that you get an unobstructed view and it was nice to have one.

1672,11/3/2009,RCmQ,"Overall I think we got what we paid for. I liked the location.  Right on Michigan within reasonable (to my wife and I) walking distances to the museums and loop.  Slightly out of the way for walking to anywhere much north like the Mag Mile or Navy Pier. The rooms were reasonably sized.  They were an odd mixture of very new and modern very old barely maintained fixtures from when the hotel was built in the 60s.  For example, new marble sink counter and newer white bathroom tile with a bathroom door that must have had 12 coats of paint on it. The wireless Internet was pretty annoying.  You had to get a pass code from the front desk for every 24 hour use.  I wish I could have just paid for wireless the entire stay. One day housekeeping took our door tag and I had to get a new one from the front desk.  Another day, our neighbor across the hall took it.   The staff at the front desk was always courteous and willing to help. We stayed for a week and had to play an interesting game of musical rooms.  Before flying out, my wife called to confirm that we'd have our requested king-sized bed.  After we checked in and got into our room, we discovered...two full-sized beds.  We complained and they put us into a very nice corner room with a queen.   We would have loved to have stayed there but there was an incredible banging of pipes, presumably due to the cold weather fighting with the heating.  To get a feel for how this sounded, take a metal pot and start tapping it with a spoon increasingly harder for about 2 minutes.  Stop for 10 minutes.  Repeat.  Imagine sleeping under these conditions.  One desk member acted surprised and another said, ""Yeah, I've heard of people having problems in the corner rooms"". There was no way we could sleep in there another night so we got yet another room but since it was the weekend, all they had were rooms with twin beds.  Given that we couldn't sleep in the other room, we had no choice but were told that the next day they'd have rooms available with king-sized beds. Sure enough they did.  Except the lights on the bed did not work and the toilet seat would not stay up.  At this point I was tired of the moving and wasn't bother by peeing sitting down for the rest of my stay. For a one or two night stay, I wouldn't have any problems returning.  But for any longer, forget it.",3,2,0,1,N,qNcpTFx1iYMKD51eDYmk3g,Hank P.,"Rockville, MD",August 2009,1,40,1,76,12,10,4,0,1,0.03457216940363008,i9E45E2RGZo-2XY66pDPeQ,Jake's Steak,"Jake's Steak - Downtown - Saint Louis, MO",27,3.0,"Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants, Burgers, Barbeque, METADATA","708 N 2nd St Saint Louis, MO 63102 Neighborhood: Downtown",Yes,$$,No,http://www.jakesstl.com,(314) 621-8184,0

He let us know where to get great pizza (expect a review sometime later), great bars around town, and how to get around the city. First, to start off with a few complaints, the bathroom was ridiculously small. I know if some of my friends would have been with me, there is no way they could have shut the door without standing in the shower to do so. But, not a big problem. Second, the pool and sauna closes at 10pm, that sucked, especially since it seemed like such a great idea after drinking at a football game all day. Now onto the good stuff, there is a mini fridge (empty) in your room! I don't know why more hotels don't understand that I want to keep my own things in my fridge, I don't want to buy your overpriced snickers bars or one ounce shots of liquor, when I can buy something at the local 7-11 for a third of the price! Next, the view was incredible! My friend and I could see as far as we wanted onto Lake Michigan (we were on the 9th floor), we could see Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. The view was worth the price (about $150 after taxes and fees per night). The bed wasn't the greatest bed, but it wasn't horrible either. My last complaint, because it felt like they were just trying to charge us a few extra bucks, was to hold our bags Sunday after we checked out but before our plane left, they charged us a few dollars. I thought that was cheap, when we would have just tipped the Bellman instead (but we decided to, only because it was Javier though)! Regarding the price - our friends on the trip told us they got the W. Chicago for $100 the week before they left, when we booked two to three weeks ahead of time and paid $150 per night.

We waited 20 minutes and I then walked to the bar to ask for service. I was told to take a seat and someone would be there shortly. It became clear that the server was so surly because he was one of only 2 people working the entire bar area, and he had to actually go behind the bar and make the drinks after taking the orders. Luckily, he had a busman who retrieved the food orders and brought them to the table so the bartender/server didn't have to do that. It was embarrasssing looking around the room at other patrons waiting for service, and some who left after a period of time and simply abandoned their coupon, rather than waiting the time it took to be served. Unfortunately, the management of the hotel was so inept as to allow this situation to occur. With a promotion in effect, one would think they would have staffed the room adequately to take are of the traffic brought in by the coupon.

Let's just say I was shocked when I walked in... it was so small! Smaller than my bedroom in my apartment. Like... if I put the ironing board out, I couldn't really get anywhere. The bed was nice and the TV on the wall was big, and the bathroom was modern and impressive as well. This is pretty random but while I was in the shower (with glass doors), I could see through the window all down Michigan. Kinda cool! I noticed a spider web on the wall which was easy to spot in the clean, shiny bathroom, but I forgot about it... until later that night when I saw a spider crawling on it.

There was ZERO cell reception in my hotel room.  Because of this, I couldn't effectively take work calls and had to use the hotel phone [which didn't work when I first arrived and engineering had to come in to fix.]  My laptop operates via an aircard so wireless internet is always available, but because there was no cell reception - I had to purchase the hotel internet service for $9.95/day.  AND, the actual hotel wireless was relatively slow! I spoke with a manager who said they'd waive the internet fee, but sure enough, when I received my bill under the door I'd been charged for internet.  So had to wait in line at the front desk to get adjusted before leaving. I ordered room service the first night - an Asian chicken salad - and the chicken was so dry I had to push aside and just eat the lettuce.  For $26, it was pretty gross and disappointing.   Finally, the maid service barely cleaned the room; the bed was made but that was about it.  In fact, I'd left my curling iron on by accident and they didn't even turn it off, let alone unplug it, so when I got home that night it had burned through a bottle of lotion.  I was surprised such little attention was paid to detail here.  Despite the convenient location, I would not recommend this hotel nor would I choose to stay here again.",2,0,0,0,N,QjNjVF-ZdWr-P4zUzXwpVA,Jessica The Puma K.,"Roseville, CA",January 2008,166,816,58,1995,1500,1295,1049,272,35,0.47031700288184436,LlzTkHsrnS_UXb452sT7AQ,Metro,"Metro - Downtown - Saint Louis, MO",32,4.0,"Hotels & Travel, Transportation, Public Transportation, METADATA","707 N 1st St Saint Louis, MO 63102 Neighborhood: Downtown",None,None,None,http://www.metrostlouis.org,(314) 982-1436,0

It is less wasteful and more environemntally friendly therefore less American:-). It is done everywhere in Europe. I told the reception of that. For one day, it was OK. Next days again they were changing every towel I touched. The breakfast is extremely expensive for what it is. They definitly need more variety. WiFI is free in the lobby area but $9 per day if you use it from your room. Extortionate to say the least. Even if you use a phone card to make an international call, as soon as you are connected, there is an outrageous $1.50 on your bill. Lastly, if you stay long and need laundry done, it is $8 per shirt! On the brighter side, the staff is good and professional. When I told them about the breakfast at check out, they offered me a free breakfast which is nice but it also made me think about the variety. I also complained about the breakfast in twitter which means they follow social media, also positive. The location of the hotel is excellent and the jazz they play at all times at reception is heart warming. What is really funny about this hotel is that British Airways crew stays here.

I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago for a romantic weekend in the city. I checked in Friday night, and checked out Sunday morning. My fiance got a Groupon, so we got a suite, free wifi, and two vouchers for two glasses of wine (4 glasses total). The hotel is very nice. It's location is on the Mag Mile, so it's a perfect stop for shoppers. The room was very clean and spacious. I get really paranoid when something doesn't feel clean, but this place put me at ease. I didn't worry about feeling dirty. The suite included a separate living room connected to the bathroom and bedroom. It makes the room more intimate. The room is very modern considering it's a very old building. The Allerton has been around since Al Capone was roaming the mean streets of Chicago. I did read about their renovation, so I could see and feel the newness of the hotel. The lobby and bar is on the second floor. The only complaint I have with their bar area is that it's so hot. The open fireplace makes the area so warm and stuffy. The bar is tiny, only a couple of couches and chairs. The second floor exudes modern luxury. I wished they kept more remnants of the old building. I love historical places, and I felt like it lost that touch in here. The second floor of this hotel knocked off a star. I personally did not have any issues with the staff at the hotel. Everyone seems to be hospitable. No complaints there! Overall, this was a fun place to stay. Considering I really love B&Bs, I wouldn't mind staying here again.

The poor service started with the bellman bringing the bags up--which took about 45 min plus a phone call. They had no idea where the bags were, someone would be ""right up"" etc.  We eventually got the bags, went to dinner, came back and hit the sack. It felt like there was something in the bed---like sand or something sharper. Weird. The next day we came back at 4pm, and housekeeping still hadn't shown up. I called downstairs and they told me ""they have until 6pm.""  Needed towels.  ""They are on their way"" No towels ever came.  I grabbed some off the cart in the hall.  Came back from dinner around 9, called for towels again, stopped by the lobby, asked for towels, and left my business card with night clerk and asked for the manager to call me the next day. No one ever called. Eventually--after a about 30 min, some  towels came. The second night I inspected the bed a little more closely. The mattress covers are made out of some sort of woven plastic, and a handful of the fibers stick through the sheet---they are so sharp they stick right through the sheet. The effect is like sleeping on a tack. Other issues---tiny/slow elevators.  No coffee maker in the room, so all the guests are going to the lobby in the AM for coffee, then waiting in lines to get back on elevators.

They are literally only a couple of blocks away.  Of course, my wife loved the fact that they were smack center of Miracle Mile where all the boutique stores are. Overall the hotel was clean and modern chic.  It is apparent that it is an older building that has gone through some renovation.  But this adds to a bit of its charm, including the funny smelling elevator. Only elevators that are over 50 years old can have that distinct smell - hard to describe, but you'll know it when you smell it. The room was a lot larger than what one would expect from a hotel situated in the heart of the city.  There was more than enough space to prevent us from feeling claustrophobic.  I have stayed at some boutique hotels that were so cramped that you couldn't lift your hands to shampoo in the shower and hit my head on the wall trying to get off the toilet (really!).  The fitness center is very large with equipment that have individual video screens and they provide you with disposable headphones as well.  Chilled towels are also available so you can cool down after a hard workout.  The only minus I found was the industrial flush toilets in the bathrooms - you'll know what I mean when you see it.  It is not the kind that has the lever on the tank, but the one that is on the water pipe.

There is a tall, skinny caucasian boy with brown hair at the front door bellman station who I am convinced is on facebook/waching movies on the computer up there all day long. He would literally watch me struggle through the heavy glass door with my gear day in and day out without moving a muscle. Other bellmen would help me carry it to the elevator but not this kid.... -I have diabetes and my shakes were removed from the mini-bar and thrown out. He obviously didnt know of my condition, but either way, UNACCEPTABLE. -the base rate internet plan (9.95/day) is so slow it was unusable. Upgraded to the 14.95/day plan which was enough to not have to wait for pages to load but not fast enough for me to do my work which requires uploading and downloading of photographs/video. The 19.95 plan was better, but CUT OUT ... literally stopped working completely once an hour or so, rendering it totally unsable. I told the Manager Carlos about all of this and he seemed sympathetic. I was booked to return this month, and he took off my internet charges, upgraded my room for my next stay, and promised a free fridge in my room. I didnt write a bad review and kept my week long reservation for this month thinking maybe this bad run was a fluke. I just called there to change my reservation and extend by one day. It took over 30 minutes and 4 seperate phone calls.. The reservationist was unhelpful and RUDE, transferred me back to the operator, who then transferred me again to some voiemail for reservations instructing me to leave a message?? C'mon....after literally at least transfers back and forth and repeating myself over and over for 22 minutes... No one seemed able to open or change my reservation and she insisted I booked it via a travel agent. Nope... booked direct thru their own website. I finally gave up with the attitude and ineptitude of the reservationists who literally REFUSED to transfer me to a manager. Took me another TWO MORE CALLS to get to the Concierge (first time i was transfered to a voicemail again)... finally where Lewis was helpful and apologetic. I remember him from the last time when i helped me and he is great... warm, welcoming.. one of the two (the other being Carlos) who seemed to give a sh*t about their jobs. This place is hit or miss. There are a couple gems in the staff but expect a rude, uncourteous, and downright pathetic experience with anyone else you deal with in the hotel, particularly on the phone. BOTTOM LINE THINGS TO EXPECT: - a small room with small windows so very little light - a tiny bathroom with no products (no lotion? ) and ZERO counterspace. Literally there is a 5inch metal ledge which was too small to accomodate my  makeup case. - pathetic service from everyone in the hotel except those at the top. (bellmen, valet, reservationists etc) - great location at a very cheap rate.... but you get what you pay for I guess... I'm sorry Allerton. I gave you another chance... I would not have written all of this had your phone staff not just wasted 45 mins of my day giving me attitude, hanging up on me, and telling me in 20 different ways they couldnt help.",1,1,0,1,N,PrwnAL82LL4Ewt_wJpHWCA,Rachael the foodie connector N.,"Cleveland, OH",October 2009,243,359,7,609,314,189,153,4,23,0.32755474452554745,89OpC3gLfk1YiM9Ps5J11g,The Great Grizzly Bear,"The Great Grizzly Bear - Soulard - Saint Louis, MO",22,3.5,"Nightlife, Bars, METADATA","1027 Geyer Ave Saint Louis, MO 63104 Neighborhood: Soulard",Yes,$,None,http://www.greatgrizzlybearsoulard…,(314) 231-0444,0

Double bed, yes, and room cozy but not too small.  Bathroom much larger than expected with nice variegated tile.  Wireless internet in room $10 for a ""lite"" option that provides quite speedy service, though not hardy enough to stream Netflix.  You can upgrade for $5 or $10 additional. Even if you get the fastest option, the total bill for this location ($75 room + $10 internet + $11 tax = $94) on Michigan Avenue is quite a bargain in my book. Solid wood bedroom door to the hallway still permitted me to hear conversations as people walked by, but I was close to the elevator and for the most part my stay was very quiet until my second night's neighbors arrived.  I could hear a decent amount of conversing through the shared wall. Elevators are numerous and very fast.  Five blocks from the Chicago/State stop on the blue line, so you are merely a 45 minute, $2.50 train ride from O'Hare. Exercise room is huge and adequate.

And to the folks who complain about the internet fees, room service prices, etc.:  There are no surprises.  All you need to do is a little reading either before you book or when you arrive to your room.  Everything is clearly stated in the hotel information book in your room.  If something is unclear, ask!  We are very laid-back guys and I have had a difficult time understanding the things some people choose to complain about.  The only conclusion I can arrive to is that some people are simply just picky, high-maintenance whiners.  If you expected the Ritz-Carlton, then you should pay many times what the Allerton charges for its lovely accomodations in an excellent location and spare everyone your grief in the process.  We had a wonderful time in Chicago and would stay at the Allerton again, no questions asked.",5,0,0,0,N,QhfO8I8-eGuh5p2i-F-ewQ,Callie CDP P.,"Sandwich, IL",November 2010,10,11,0,5,1,4,2,0,0,0.015714285714285715,Qn71FRFnAS1r4wcIWpcWCg,T L C Nanny & Child Care Service,"T L C Nanny & Child Care Service - University City - Saint Louis, MO",1,5.0,"Add, METADATA","7301 Tulane Ave Saint Louis, MO 63130 Neighborhood: University City",None,None,None,http://www.tlcforkids.com,(314) 725-5660,0

I wish they had more amenities on top of the basics - more products, like lotion in addition to shampoo and conditioner and bar soap.  Some fridge room would be nice.  They should also keep a closer eye to detail - my bathroom faucet had a missing piece that looked like it broke off.  The bed and the room overall looked clean except for a random blood stain on my sheet.  I think every hotel that charges for internet is just ripping you off a little bit.  it's almost like charging you for potable water.  They do it because they can but they really shouldn't given this day and age where free wifi is not only welcome but a required amenity - charging for it is just like throwing away customer goodwill.   Breakfast in bed was good - but pricey - I guess that's what you should expect from a hotel.

The location is perfect; the lobby, lounge, and bedrooms are very classy, and the beds are super-comfortable.  However, given how expensive everything seemed, I was disappointed with the amenities. Even budget chains will often provide free cable TV, wifi, and continental breakfast service, but I was faced with the following: a) WiFi is free in the lobby, but $10/day surcharge in your room. What a ripoff.  Obviously they have it wired already, so I feel they're being malicious in asking us to pay for it.  I was able to pull a usable open signal from the hotel next door. b) No TV.  They advertise ""free cable TV"" in every room but mine sure didn't have any. Instead you have a fancy LCDtv with a truly crappy hotel-installed interface, where everything is pay-per-view.  Want to watch a recent episode of TV?  You only have a few options.  I chose 30 Rock... and was asked to pay $5 to watch a recent episode.  What a ripoff.  You are being asked to pay for what is basically Hulu.  There are movies for ~$15 of course, but that is pretty standard. There is a laughable ""free"" section on the menu but it consists of crud that appears to be free videos from the internet.  One had Tom Arnold, one was called ""Naked Wine"" and featured naked wine reviews. Except the woman wasn't attractive... or naked (it shows from the shoulders up). WTF Allerton, I feel you are just TRYING to be jerks. Plus originally the TV wouldn't turn on; then there was a period when it would keep turning itself back on. c) No breakfast, not even tea.  Ok, so I didn't care about the breakfast. It's just an observation.  I REALLY would have liked some tea though.  In the morning they had coffee in the lobby, but NO TEA!  Maybe this is a midwest bias that I can't understand, coming from California. d) As others have mentioned, there is no storage space.  Closet is a decent sized but you'll have no dressers to keep your clothes. So I was pretty disappointed with the place, until I looked up the prices. Turns out to be somewhat of a budget hotel: $100-150/night for a single queen or double full room, which is pretty good actually.  I was forced to reevaluate in light of this.  I'd say that this is a great place to stay if you want to feel like you're staying in a luxury hotel but paying economy prices.  Located right on the Magnificent Mile, it doesn't get much better.  Just try to get a room on the upper floors, to enjoy the view.",3,1,1,0,N,O8i10nA3Dh1bfqF1IWWvrA,gnat c.,"San Francisco, CA",January 2006,37,162,18,89,28,33,24,0,6,0.06572008113590264,w07xzi6F_vhIYJDisQem-w,Subway,"Subway - Severna Park, MD",1,4.0,"Restaurants, Sandwiches, METADATA","574 Benfield Rd Severna Park, MD 21146",Yes,$,None,http://www.subway.com,(410) 647-0032,0

No dresser - the only drawers were in the tiny nightstand. There was no space in the bathroom for toiletries. Somehow I got a handicapped bathroom, so it was huge but had no space at the same time.

Not to mention the complimentary champagne and fresh fruit sent to the room:) The evening of our  reception was indescribable! The reception space was so elegantly set-up with a dance floor large enough to accommodate all of our 125 guests with ease.

Being one person I thought I would be fine but I noticed I was bumping into things and stepping on things on the floor all the time. Now I know how small animals feel in a cage. The lobby is very small as well, and finally to punctuate the smallness of it all, the elevators were miniature and could maybe hold 4 people comfortably. The rooms are fairly new decor wise. The bathroom was decorated nicely but the area around the shower was starting to show its age in terms of dirty grout and stains.

It blends hip and history all into one-- what a unique boutique hotel should be! The service is excellent, from the reservations team to the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeping, waitstaff- you name it.  I'm not going to say that there haven't been minor mistakes- like I had to call twice to change my reservation, etc.  But overall, the attitude is consistently caring, professional, and there is attention to detail everywhere. Main lobby and lounge area are very inviting- nice relaxing space to meet up with friends/colleagues or just surf the net on your laptop.  The rooms are fresh, upbeat, modern, extremely clean, and very quiet.  I was upgraded to a suite (even though I was paying a corporate rate-- nice!) It has a stylish sofa/hideaway bed with a work area and plasma TV.  The bedroom has a large king bed (surprisingly comfortable- NOT hard or hollow like most hotel beds), a beautiful large floor length mirror, make up table, another plasma TV and a bathroom in floor-to-ceiling marble.

Avoid the restaurant!  We had their $19 brunch and pretty much every item was stone cold The Bell Staff, in a word, astounding...hilarious...helpful...sarcastic...­since we were there for so long, we got to know many of them and we'd head out into the night hearing them warn us about no calls from the police to come pick us up or for us to behave.  Always friendly, got cabs for us immediately, great suggestions for places to hang out...they made the stay fun...even if they couldn't believe we walked all over downtown, from Navy Pier to Huron 'on purpose'.

We stayed at the Allerton on a holiday weekend and got an amazing deal on Hotwire. (I paid more per night to stay in a dingy motel in Santa Monica, but that is an entirely different review.) I read the Yelp reviews before I came and was bracing for the worst-mainly that I would be sleeping in a closet, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We stayed in the Standard room, which I think is their smallest room. It has a full sized bed, and a tiny bathroom (so two people can't get ready at once) but was otherwise spacious and clean. The fitness center was also well equipped with new treadmills, ellipticals, weights and a TVs on all the equipment. The location is also in the middle of everything. A stay at the Four Seasons it is not, but for the price, it really can't be beat. All in all, I think this is a great boutique hotel that has been renovated quite nicely and I would definitely stay here again. I am taking away one star because of two things: 1) the elevators are the SLOWEST most awful elevators ever. I know this is beyond management's control since it is an old building and they probably had to work with the existing framework, but OH MY GOD.

Sure, there were some glitches here and there, but nothing too bad that would make me not want to come back. Before we left, we tried to call to confirm our reservations but the phone rang continuously with no answer. Found that weird. We had 2 rooms. I stayed in a ""standard"" room with 2 other girls. We had two full size beds. The rooms were pretty small, but I expected it from all the reviews I read, so it wasn't a big deal for us. Our other 2 friends stayed in a ""petite"" room with one bed and that room was TINY! On our second night, we encountered a rather disturbing issue with our room.  We left a window open to ""air out"" while we were out touring the city. When we came back, we noticed that there were tiny bugs flying on the ceiling. The service guy came to spray the room and suggested we switch rooms due to the smell of bug spray and dead bugs that fell on our sheets and carpet. I called management but the hotel was all sold out. He offered to re-clean our room, change the sheets, etc while we were out for the night and he would comp the room for the night and switch us to a suite the next day. Since that was our only option, and since it was our fault for leaving the window open after a storm, we accepted. What bothered me was when the housekeeping manager called the room, she was so rude and told me that her department was leaving for the night and would not be able to clean our room if we were not out in the next few minutes. I told her that when housekeeping came to our room, I asked if it was ok if we called when we left in about 30 minutes and housekeeping kindly said that it was not a problem. The housekeeping manager rudely said, ""that's not true.""  How is SHE going to tell ME about what was said in a conversation between me and another housekeeper??!!  RUDE. All she had to do was tell me that her department closes in 45 minutes and we need to be out so they can clean the room. Period. We would've been happy to leave to accomodate them. My friends and I gathered our stuff to our other friend's tiny room to finish getting ready so that housekeeping could clean our room. The next day we were upgraded to a really beautiful suite. All in all, the hotel was clean and in a great location. The elevators were somewhat slow but not a big deal. I think the longest we waited was 5 minutes. Majority of the staff was friendly and helpful. Checking in (late) and checking out were quick and easy. Complimentary coffee in the lounge area was delicious.

1752,9/7/2011,oujqoWXEWbwSWwESAWWxlw,"First, the good. Great location. So close to everything downtown. Staff was friendly enough. The valet is $40 per night, but honestly, the self park garages around the area charge the same for 24 hours, so it's really the going rate. It just seems like a circus in the valet area, so you're almost better off parking across the street at the self park. Now, the bad. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which would go for around $340 per night on the weekend, but we did not pay full price. When you see a rate like that, you expect a great quality stay, but not in this case. The light switch covers were falling off in several places throughout our room. The flat screen T.V. was blurry (odd!). The Wi-Fi continuously disconnected. The shower had no water pressure (looked like it needed a good dip in CLR) and the towel rack was hung inside the shower? The coffee maker had an old coffee pod in it from a previous guest. Yuck. Also, out of 6 packages of coffee, 5 were decaf. Really? The walls were really thin. Complete conversations could be heard through them. The doors did not close without some muscle. The wait for the elevator (and there were 3 of them) was really long. We were not impressed. We had stayed at the Fairfield Inn about a block away a few years back, and seriously, it was far cleaner and better maintained. And about half the price. A few other things happened that were beyond the control of the hotel, but they were still annoying. We had some smokers on our floor, and after a call to the front desk, security came and told them it was a non-smoking hotel. Thankfully, that seemed to do the trick. But it was hours before the smell dissipated. Also, a dog peed in the elevator right as we were getting on. But, who wants to get back out and wait who knows how long for another one? Again, not the fault of the hotel, but when so many other things were bad, it just added to the negative vibe. I think there are many hotels in that area that are cheaper and better maintained. Crowne Plaza definitely needs to take a close look at housekeeping and maintenance. I would not recommend this hotel.",2,4,0,0,N,pbyxWMCyRe8_NZihJToYKw,Pamela Scooby M.,"Sarasota, FL",May 2008,120,185,33,171,70,22,24,178,6,0.11462205700123916,SzVAlsvIVy2K9jY80uyCMw,Van Galder Bus Company,"Van Galder Bus Company - Madison, WI",12,4.5,"Hotels & Travel, Transportation, METADATA","520 University Ave Madison, WI 53703",None,None,None,http://www.vangalderbus.com,None,0

Spent four days here, and the service was impeccable; from check-in time to the minute we left the place, every single thing was perfect. I made reservations a month in advance, and when I received my confirmation email a few days before our trip reminding me of my reservation (like I needed a reminder? Thanks anyway!), there was a note at the bottom notifying me of a $20 suite upgrade if I brought in the printout. So I did. I presented it during check in, fully ready to pay the 20 bucks to upgrade for a suite. If I'm staying in Chicago for four days, might as well stay in style, right? Well...I didn't need to present the confirmation form OR pay the 20 dollars -- they upgraded me for free. Wow. The room was amazing. There was plenty of room, and free wireless internet is always a plus. And our view of the city was FANTASTIC. Wow. I couldn't stop taking pictures. We had a few things that we needed to refrigerate, and I noticed in the guest book that they rented out small fridges for $25 a night, so I called housekeeping to get one. I wasn't excited about paying $100 for a fridge, but I needed it. Well, a few minutes later, the front desk attendant called and told me that the fridge was on it's way up to our room, and it would only be a $20 dollar charge for our entire stay. SWEET! I loved the location of the hotel. It was steps away from Michigan avenue, and there were plenty of bus stops around to take us anywhere else we needed to go.  It was 2 blocks from Giordano's! Can't beat that at all! Elephant & Castle is a cool pub connected to the hotel. The service can be slow at times, but the food is terrific. Don't skip out on that. The 40th floor lounge left a lot to be desired. You can get better drinks and atmosphere elsewhere. When I come back to Chicago, there's no doubt in my mind that I will stay at the Avenue again.

1755,8/10/2010,FLd4tNGgyDfF8hUvOrtthA,"I recently stayed at the Avenue for 4 nights and I really enjoyed my stay. When I first got there I was upgraded to a suite from my regular room because my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. We had a great room 2615 which had a great view of the Chicago Skyline which I would look at as I fell asleep in our giant king size bed. The room was also on a corner so our bedroom was very bright when we had the curtains open. The room also had a lot of closet space, one in the livingroom and a walk in closet in the bedroom. I dont know what people are saying about the TV channels.... there were plenty... 50+ so either they upgraded their cable or I think 50+ channels is enough in a hotel... since you're not there to watch tv on vacation right? The only thing that might annoy people is that Northwestern University Hospital is across the street so ambulances come and go all the time with sirens on. It didnt bother me at all but I am a sound sleeper. But I also live i a big city and am use to sirens all the time. The rooftop pool was awesome. I went everyday and it was really warm... 70F or 20C. Great view from up there too. The only real issue I had was with room service. I ordered a french onion soup which was delicious and a garden salad which in the room service menu said it was with mesculn greens, tomato, cucumber and croutons. When it arrived to my dismay it was the non nutritional heart of romaine lettuce and most of the pieces were white and it did not have croutons. When I told the front desk they looked into it which I was happy about. Later she told me that room service said I got what I had asked for which I certainly did not... I know what the menu said and it did not match what arrived at my room. I was happy that the concierge took it off my bill but they did not include the 20% charge that goes on the $5.50 they took off my bill. I was not wanting to overcomplain so I am yelping you to advise you not to order the garden salad from room service. Special shout out to our housekeeper Elizabetha.

The lady at the check-in counter was pleasant and gave us a corner one bedroom suite on the 27th floor (which I'm pretty sure wasn't what we had reserved for just $95). The room was great. Leather couch, flat screen TV, i-home and a comfy 'zebra' chair - and that's just the living room area. The bedroom was like any other hotel room except with better decor, a nice view of Michigan ave and the best bed ever. The goose down pillows were heavenly and I think we had the best sleep in years on that bed. It was insanely comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was small but efficient with a nice wide shower head and soft towels. We did not have to call or request anything. Everything was provided. We did not try the sky lounge or their room service so can't comment on that. (I am not one to pay $15 + tax + $3 room service charge + 18% gratuity just so I can eat 2 eggs and toast!)

This is mid-market for downtown Chicago but the hotel is in a terrific location on the Magnificent Mile within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and Navy Pier. A 24 hour Walgreens is two blocks away. Overall we were very happy with the experience. Service - just outstanding. Everyone was exceedingly helpful and we were immediately upgraded to a suite since my wife and I were traveling with two children. Questions were easily answered and any minor problems were quickly addressed. Staff tried very hard to accommodate all our requests. See below. Room Quality - solid if not spectacular. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of room. Bathrooms were clean. Refrigerator is a full mini-bar with no room for anything else. We took things out to put our own drinks in. Initially we were billed for the things we took out because, evidently, if you move items it activates a sensor. The staff was very nice about it and took the charges off the bill. They even comped us the 2-3 snacks my kids ate. Hard to complain about that. TV was a little small but who, eh, really cares. Go do stuff. Amenities - my kids loved the rooftop pool and went up there almost every day. I never made it but the kids said it was great. Free WiFi! - you can't take this for granted any more. Very easy to use. Slower than optimum but not unduly so. This was a factor in choosing the hotel, if you can believe that. Business Center - Lower marks for the business center. Internet was unbelievably slow and problems were encountered because of the odd customized browser installed which led to unnecessary complications with printing and disabling pop-up blockers. Not to pick on the Crowne, since this is an endemic irritation with most hotel business centers. Make sure you aren't in a hurry (e.g. rushing to buy and print event tickets) if you use this.

We made our reservation through the hotel's website for a regular King bed room and they upgraded us to a junior king suite when we checked in. The room was on the 7th floor and we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. The hotel itself is historical and it has retained its charm through the decor and rustic style furniture. At the same time, the bed, linen, bathroom feels clean and does not look dingy or old. The suite was huge. There is an entryway when you first come in which opens up into a sitting room with a couch (which I believe could be made into a queen bed), two arm chairs, desk, TV, and closet. This is connected to the bedroom with a King bed, another closet, and another TV! My only complaint was that the tub drained a bit slowly and they were not really able to resolve the issue even after I had asked them to clear it. We were celebrating a special occasion and the girl at the front desk was very nice to acknowledge this when we were checking in. The general manager also sent us a cake and a bottle of champagne the first night to help us celebrate!

1776,1/30/2011,2rsz,"Where is the ability to post a photo for a review on here?  I can't find it, because I took a shot of the cheese platter that my partner and I shared at the Palm Court during our stay there this weekend. And that is where our story begins, my dear readers.  A cheese platter with Town House crackers on one side, and Clubhouse on the other?  Yep, you read that right.  Oh, how the Drake has fallen on hard times, I thought, especially when I heard that they just did a Groupon for High Tea there.  Has it come to that?  Before they do a deal with Groupon, Sun-Times' new WantsaDeal, or any other--- I would suggest they get their house in order. Now, since I stayed there the whole weekend, I feel a bit entitled to comment across the board on the Drake.  I've lived in Chicago for 17+ years (most of my adult life), so I never stay at a hotel in town, but it felt like a luxury to treat my partner to his birthday weekend at a hotel that, for me, conjured images of Mad Men, high style, and impeccable service. I won't go into the coordination ""challenges"" with organizing a group of 30 friends for late night dessert and drinks, but I will say that when the evening was complete and I was ready for bed, I found out we were ""conveniently"" placed next to a bridal party, who sounded as though they were in our room.  In fact, at 7 the next morning, these people hosted guests (more like the entire party.. people were literally in the hallway!!) in their room (which was not a suite). Really? The hotel allows that, when there's nothing but a hollow door that separates rooms?  As my partner said, he's never been in a hotel of the Drake's status in which you could literally hear the people right next to you. We capped off our stay with an $80 breakfast for 2 at Drake Bros that consisted of: a waiter who tried to push the buffet on us (lazy), 1 order of cold brioche french toast (3 small slices), 2 Drake Breakfasts (my ""aged pork loin"" was a shriveled up small slice of cold, bland ham), and water.  Ouch to lack of value. The Drake could be so much more than what's it's become-- a tourist destination for bridal parties, or girls, their Mother's, and their American dolls.  In fact, if they took a page from some great hotels in New York (e.g., Gramercy Park Hotel) that have emerged as hip, local destinations that still appeal to travelers-- with cool furnishings, but with nods to the past, it could be so much more successful.  Instead of cheese trays with Keebler Crackers, and restaurants with names like ""Cape Cod Room"" written in rope and ""Lobster Thermador"" on the menu (OML, Gordon Ramsey would have a field day here), it really needs to be brought into the 21st Century.  A nod to Mad Men, but contemporized.   But, please, start with eliminating the ""cheesy"" crackers and soundproofing the rooms. As a post script to this review, the Drake graciously accepted our feedback, apologized, and ""made it right by us"".  That's a classy start and I respect them and would give them another chance.",2,4,3,6,N,rvzecBC5Q0g5rlrc7DjGYA,Shinae R.,"Oceanside, CA",June 2010,24,11,0,26,24,21,5,1,3,0.012895662368112544,3LsoEB11nc9vH4ZWxH64-g,Meriter Hospital Park,"Meriter Hospital Park - Madison, WI",1,4.0,"Health and Medical, Hospitals, METADATA","202 S Park St Madison, WI 53715",None,None,None,http://www.Meriter.com,(608) 417-6000,0

Now granted- as with any historic building- your room is kind of the ""luck of the draw"". Over the years rooms have been combined, cut in half, etc to maximize the space but that is just one of the quirks of old hotels. The Drake has recently also undergone a remodel so all the spaces are new, clean and up to date. My room, on this stay, was fabulous. It was huge- easily accommodating a king sized bed, desk chair and ottoman, dresser, bar and overlooked Lake Michigan. The marbled bath was also huge- in fact- you could have put additional furniture into it. The ceilings were at least 15 feet tall and bordered in crown molding. The hallway was wide and regal. But I also know from previous stays, that some rooms are smaller, have no view, and some have 2 bathrooms and a small bedroom- and some are suites. If when you push open your door and are dissatisfied- you owe it to yourself to call the desk to see if there is anything else available. Hilton Hotels now owns the Drake so all the expected amenities are there- the comfy soft beds and linens, the Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, the well stocked mini bar and good service (although I am a frequent traveler at Hilton hotels so that may have helped out in the service area) My room rate was only $139 per night (plus an additional $49 per night for valet parking- next time I'm leaving the car at home!) One of my favorite parts of the stay was a book that was in the room chronicling the history of the Drake hotel through letters and pictures of all the famous people who had gone through it's doors. And oh if those doors could speak. Queens, Kings, celebrities have all stayed at the Drake. Also interesting were the pictures of the old ads that billed the Drake as the place to get ""Lake Michigan air"" for only $5 per night (1920) I may not be a Queen, a King or any kind of a celebrity.

Having grown up in the surrounding suburbs, I have been made well aware of the prestige and history behind The Drake. When my then boyfriend and I planned our 1 year anniversary, we decided to each plan surprises for one another involving things we saw on our first date - a freezing cold 8 hour day spent exploring different parts the city. When walking by The Drake, I'd told him that it was the finest of the finest (he was from Kentucky and therefore unfamiliar) so for my anniversary I was surprised with a two night stay at this luxurious hotel. Words cannot properly describe the warmth of this debonair lobby with its beautiful rich mahogany toned colors, fine crystal chandeliers, and overwhelming aura of class. While well kept, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the decor was as old as the hotel itself. If not, I tip my hat to the person that recreated the sheer elegance of the 1920's. When I'm not writing about bars or drinking, I can be somewhat of a history nerd, and as dorky as it may sound, I enjoyed feeling like I had stepped in the past. Then I arrived on my floor. Holy Shit when did this become The Overlook Hotel? The second  I walked off the elevator, I became immediately aware that I was in a 90 year old building. The colors were cold and in complete contrast to what I expected from the lobby. It was almost a little creepy. When we arrived in our room, I found it very odly arranged. This may be a little hard to follow, so bear with me. Picture a rectangular room. The bed is against the a long side and faces the other long side with a night stand and desk on either side. The television (if laying in bed) was in the upper right corner of the room. Basically, the television wasn't straight on to the bed and the other long wall that was opposite to the bed was completely bare. The room just seemed very oddly arranged and unfinished. Much like the hallways, it lacked any color and had a slightly spooky vibe. While we were there, the concierge was nice enough to take us on a tour of the Presidential Suite where Princess Diana famously stayed in the early 90's. Once again I was blown away by the elegance of the 1920's being beautifully captured. It was surprisingly stunning to see such luxury up close. Even though our room slightly creeped me out, I still love The Drake Hotel for all that it embodies. Despite being $400 a night, I'm pretty sure our room was the equivalent of second class on the Titanic. I'm not sure we got our money's worth room wise, and if I ever return (I say ever because I have since moved to the city) I would definitely upgrade my room for the full experience.

I have personally stayed at the Drake, which I booked for a friend's birthday a couple of years back during Christmas time.  And because of the season, I was very impressed with the decorations throughout. Unfortunately, my last experience with the Drake was definitely sub par. Back in June, I booked a room at the Drake with my points for a real great friend of mine and her husband to celebrate her birthday.  Because it was her birthday, I ordered a platter of cold cuts and meats along with a birthday cake, and even called the hotel and spoke to the catering manager to ensure that the catering department charged MY credit card for these items. When my friends checked in, they were very satisfied with the room, which was great.  However, when they checked out, they charged THEIR credit card for the items I ordered for her birthday.  I did not find this out until I spoke with my friends, and they told me about the incident to ensure we were not double charged for the items. When I inquired with my credit card company, they did not charge me.  What irritated me about this incident is the fact that I had to call the hotel from Florida (I was there for business) to get this entire thing straightened out AFTER I gave them specific instructions on who to charge.  What was even worse is the fact that this is very embarrassing to me in front of my friends. Now, I did contact the Hilton Diamond Desk and let them know about the incident and they conducted an investigation on this, but there were also some serious communication issues within themselves as the hotel told the Diamond Desk they contacted me, when in fact they did not.  I also called the hotel manager regarding this, and it took them 3 days to get back with me.

The Drake was nicely decorated for the holiday and the staff is VERY attentive and professional. We arrived WAY early but our room was ready.

The room was warm and very quiet with high ceilings. The bed comfortable although a little lumpy with pancake thin pillows. Hallways are very wide and bright.  Elevators are fast and some have little benches in them to sit down (cute!). I'm not sure what others are talking about for 'slow elevators'.

1831,10/14/2008,vXG8OmPdPhwpvzO4ekKIHQ,"I stayed here in July '08 for 4 nights and wasn't blown away by the hotel. I struggled between a 3 & 4 star because I expected more since it was ""The Drake"" but overall my stay was fine. Although it does have the historic charm, the location is great and the service was ok overall, there were little things that I didn't particularly care for which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.  If I could, I would of given it a 3.5 star rating. 1. When we first checked in, they gave us a room that was not made.  The bed looked like someone had laid on top of it, there was garbage in the trash can etc.  I went downstairs and they changed my room but I didn't like that the person from the front desk went to the back office to check to make sure that the room really wasn't made. 2. I assume the elevators are still from the 1920's because they move incredibly slow.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but when you have to wait several elevators (they are full from so many people waiting) in order to finally get in one during peak times (ie. check out time etc.) it's a little annoying.   3. It was pretty warm when we were there and we wanted to get ice. Well the ice machine on our floor was broken.  When I flagged down someone that worked there to tell him, he said that I'd have to go to a different floor and try the machines there.  I would think being a high end hotel, I expected him to have offered to get some for us but I guess I was expecting too much. 4. The room itself was ok although I thought the carpet needed to be changed.  It looked really used and worn in and definitely needs to be updated.  The bed was comfortable though which is a big plus in my book. One of the good things about the hotel was the gym.  The gym had just been remodeled and it's very nice.  There are some cardio and weight machines.  There is also a section that had free weights too and there are flat screen tv's there too.

Also, the champagne they advertise is $30 a glass. They also have one for $11, but they promote the $30 glass--I'm sorry but that's ridiculous.

Plenty of food at the buffet tables, along with people coming around with trays. The drinks were excellent and strong, with not so bad lines. Maybe about a 5 min wait. Tops. They had 4 rooms with a range of music from hip hop to 80s. 2 of the rooms being large, 2 being not much more than a lounge type of area. My biggest complaint was the bathrooms. The lines were horrendous! About 20-25 min wait, only to find out there was no toilet paper. Really? I send almost two hundred a ticket (not including the dinner) and you can't supply me with some soft TP for my bum?

And now that I have, anytime I'm invited I will be sure to show up. For a couple reasons. 1) Because you know that the food is going to be good. 2) Anytime you come here especially with a date or on a date I'm pretty sure you're gonna get some just based on general principal. 3) It actually feels good to go somewhere that you pass by so often on LSD, and that has so much historical significance. The restaurant inside is the famous Coq D'or. This is where Joe DiMaggio and Marylin Monroe carved their names into one of the booths. I came here for a little private wedding reception in room 550 which is the Princess Diana suite. And yes it does look fit for a princess. The view is out to lsd and the beach, and the bedroom is just about the same square footage as my last apartment. But when I think about if I would stay here... probably not.

After reading some reviews we actually wanted to stay on the highest floor (under the club) so that we can be loud or at least listen to some music on the ipod dock the hotel PROVIDES. So one minute into a song we get a knock on the door about it being loud. It was 9pm. So we decide to go party upstairs and realized we have to go down to the lobby to take a separate elevator to go to the club. Thats fine but at least tell us instead of us trying to figure out if the elevator is broken or instead of trying the stairs etc it was so stupid for a while. Club was very cool though and staff excellent. We tried the tequila from Entourage. Not my fave but shots were free. Also we went to the restaurant Argent and had an awesome chat with the waitress who gave us great tourist advice. They took the term cake in crab cake a little too literally, I felt I was eating a birthday cake. The sushi was very good. We were happy the hotel/resto/club carry sugar free redbull and they even have discrete redbull art written on the elevator doors. The room was very nice. Sadly we didnt get any of the two upgrades we had requested a month earlier but the room was ok. The rainfall shower is AMAZING. Probably my fave part. Keep in mind the only ice machine is on the 5th floor. A maid told us they have free ice delivery but to request it in the morning. We didnt know this until check out. What a downer. All in all, staff were great, valet guys are awesome and helpful. The rest is nowhere near deserving any luxurious term.

We are locals who venture downtown once or twice a year to play tourist.  We have frequently chosen The Dana Hotel for these staycations.  Our first visit a few years ago was awesome.  We were in love with its simplistic design and the great views from the corner rooms.  Last year, we noticed the upkeep had started to slip a bit, but figured the hotel would quickly address them.  Our visit this past weekend was just sad.   Not only is the hotel due for a renovation of sorts, but it is in need of some mega upkeep.  The bedroom furniture is all banged up and scratched.  The hallway carpeting on our floor was peeling back right in front of the elevator bank.  We noticed this when we checked in and it was not addressed the entire weekend.  This is ugly to begin with, but a huge trip hazzard to boot!!!  We began inspecting the entire hallway carpet one morning while waiting for the elevator (more on that to come) and noticed none of the lines in the carpet were lined up and there was a ripple effect all down the hallway.  The carpeting needs to be replaced...plain and simple. One thing I have always hated about the rooms is the bathroom.  It has an open shower which means that you can see the other person showering.  Fine...whatever.  This also means that you can see clearly the other person using the toilet.  Come on.  Absolutely nothing sexy about that.  The flimsy ""shower curtain"" which is located on the bedroom side outside of the shower is just ridiculous and doesn't fully cover the glass. The elevators blow!!!  I wish it was as simple as blaming the party goers to Vertigo Sky on the top floor, but the elevators are an issue when Vertigo is not opened.  You wait FOREVER for an elevator and when it arrives it is jammed pack full of people.  We got so fed up that we would just take the stairs down.  We were on a floor in the 20's and though we only took the stairs down I can barely walk today due to my calves hurting so freaking bad from the many ventures down the stairs!!! The majority of the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The only real odd encounter was one of the times we actually got an elevator ride.  The elevator stopped on a floor and an employee got half way in the elevator and decided to talk on the walky talky while the elevator doors kept trying to close.  We were all just staring at him.  Not once did he apologize or say excuse me or whatever...nothing.  Just held us all up and then eventually got in and rode up with us. One of the positives about this hotel is that the mini bar/fridge items are fairly decently priced.  A big plus if you want a quick beer, bottle of wine, or quick snack.  Another plus is its lcoation...you can walk to tons of restaurants/bars, etc. Doubtful that we will return to the Dana unless we hear that they have done some sort of overhaul.",2,2,1,2,N,rPX9XGkt-fhjAk_7rSojvA,Danielle Candy Girl C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",August 2011,2,21,5,5,0,8,1,14,0,0.04918032786885246,6PFODHkObwQ3zVBdv-wEig,Advantage Lawn Service,"Advantage Lawn Service - Carrollton - Carrollton, TX",2,4.5,"Home Services, Landscaping, Gardeners, METADATA","2217 Grand Canyon Ct Carrollton, TX 75006 Serving Carrollton and surrounding area Neighborhood: Carrollton",None,None,None,http://advantage-lawn-care.com,(214) 682-5797,0

As we pulled up out front the bellhop boys eagerly greeted us and took our luggage into the hotel. We arrived around 10:00am because of our early flight so the bellhop said he would tag our suitcases and when our room was ready he would have them delivered. Check in is actually one level up, you can either take the cool glass elevator directly there or walk up the short window encased beautiful stairwell up. The concierge pleasantly greeted us and advised our rooms were not ready and told us she'd alert us as soon they were. We inquired about upgrading our room and she graciously offered us a room on the quieter side of the building at a discounted rate. Room 2114 - Serene King The room is gorgeous, long & spacious with dark wood floors and a magnificent floor to ceiling window with views on the city and street below. The bed was very plush and comfy and the bathroom included a rainfall shower head and bowl sink. FYI the shower's back wall is glass and is exposed to the bedroom but covered by a curtain. So if your in the shower, someone in the bedroom could pull the curtain aside and take a peep at you. It's not an issue if your a couple but if you have privacy issues you want to keep this in mind. You also get free wifi in the hotel and complimentary use the in room keurig coffee machine. The mini bar is well stocked with affordable items. Our room was cleaned everyday and kept spotless with fresh towels replaced everyday and we had no issue with noise level at night. Dining Room service is sooo fast! Our meal came up in about 15 minutes hot and fresh! We had breakfast and dinner at Aja (on site restaurant) and both meals were exquisite! Vertigo (on site club) was amazing! They have a heated patio with fire pit and great drinks! Service Everyone from the doorman, to concierge, housekeepers, waiters, and managers were sooo kind and helpful! The concierge manager helped my fiancee arrange for flowers to be delivered to my room on my birthday, the concierge told us to have a free bottle of wine from the mini bar on the house to celebrate our birthday, the doormen were great on giving us tips on how to navigate the city and where are good places to check out. Everyone we encountered greeted us with smiles and graciousness. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to others! The Dana made our Birthdays very memorable and enjoyable!

1858,4/2/2012,N4j7iOr6memcsF3ZhhAxXg,"Introduction Lobby/Check In: As per other reviews, check in is a bit different in this hotel. My bf and I were greeted by a GREAT and NICE doorman. He explained to us that check in was upstairs, got the elevator for us and explained briefly that there was a main restaurant and lounge should we want to have a drink and a bite. Check in is a floor up and when we got of the elevator, that's when the impression of the hotel dwindled a bit. The guy, slouched in his seat, looked like he just wanted to go home. He asked for credit card and passport, then spewed of gym this, lounge this, bar that and pointed to the elevator. Excellent doorman ruined by the mediocre check-in guy. Room Number 1215: Awesome room! It's modern with hard wood floor (or look alike). The room is small, but I have to give credit to the design team that efficiently uses the space. It's a very intimate room so definitely go with someone you are comfortable sharing space with. The bathroom is spaced in such a way that the shower overlooks the room and is covered with a curtain on the outside. Such that, if you are taking a shower, someone could just pull the curtain aside and ... By the way, I loved the rainfall shower head which I have always wanted in my bathroom. There is a balcony, but the room we got, it was very small and slanted. So don't expect to be sitting and lying down outside. Besides, buildings everywhere, so not the best atmosphere to be sunbathing. Noise-Level: NOISY! This hotel is in the heart of downtown Chicago, and because there are glass windows (top to bottom), you can hear the sirens, construction, honking, etc... Light sleepers beware. Extras: Concierge. There is one man who sits at a table across from the check-in desk and he is okay. We asked him many times to recommend restaurants of various cuisines which is fine, but never offered to make reservations, or provide alternate restaurants to the ones he selected should they be busy. The concierge I envision makes reservations, provide alternatives, and seems to go to the ends of the earth to make things happen. Just me I guess. FYI. We asked the concierge for late checkout and we were told that you can only request that the morning that you are leaving...""May the odds be forever in your favour"" (YEAH HUNGER GAMES!) Vertigo Sky Rooftop Lounge. This hotel turns into a club on the weekends which makes the hotel turn into chaos. My bf and I returned from a late night movie and by 12:30AM, we could see the line of people trying to get into the hotel. The club (penthouse floor) is accessed by a card key which one man has (the bouncer I presume) which is hard for guests who just want to get up to the room because you have to wait in line too. What should have happened was to dedicate one elevator for people who wanted to go to the lounge, and the rest for guests. My bf and I were checked for ID's and were told to get to the back of the line, and we retorted that we actually were hotel guests and had to show our card key. It really is a hassle, and because of this experience, my star rating dropped. Doormen. These people are really great. The first one we encountered was excellent, and the last one on our check-out day was fabulous too (apparently, he won the best doorman award...) He stated he would get us a taxi to Mid-way airport for a flat fee of $35 because it could be more expensive with traffic, etc... He hunted down 3 taxis to get us the assured rate which we appreciated. By the way, as of today, flat rate from downtown to Midway is $35 USD. Conclusion. I'm glad we stayed at this hotel, but I don't think we will be coming back here again. I want to try other hotels in Chicago and my experience here was just A-OK. However, I can't fault the location as it is walking distance from the CTC, Magnificent Mile, and Millennium Park. 3 night stay, starting Thursday, was $640 and change including all hotel taxes and fees.",3,3,2,2,N,pSHCciaixInx1XvyhHpOfw,Blaine J.,"San Antonio, TX",January 2012,1,33,2,21,4,2,3,31,0,0.12043795620437957,pwLDfuLOSLtoLrL53DkDsg,Red Light District,"Red Light District - Gaslamp - San Diego, CA",89,4.0,"Restaurants, American (New), METADATA","409 F St (between State St & 4th Ave) San Diego, CA 92101 Neighborhood: Gaslamp",Yes,$$$,No,http://rldsd.com,(619) 255-2800,0

Figure out the problems. That's your job. That's really your only job, actually. The rooms are nice, the floor to ceiling windows in the corner rooms are pretty radical. The views are nice. If you are booking here, def get a corner as the other ones have very little light (my coworker had one). The rooms aren't huge, but they are well appointed for the most part. The bathroom was awkward, sliding door that never stayed shut, could not lock, and a curtain over the shower? Weird. IT was clean and pretty stylish though, and not a bad spot to hang for 4 days. Room service was great (from Aja downstairs). Quickly arrived and food was really good. The tray sat outside for a day though, which is actually pretty gross. Overall, I won't stay again. With so many good options in Chicago, the Dana fell short. I got a great rate on Expedia, but if you book through an engine it seems you get subpar service and a crummy attitude. No thanks.

The most annoying thing about the hotel is the elevators. We stayed with a baby and were using a stroller and you must take an elevator up 1 floor to get on another elevator to get to your room. There are 2 or 3 other elevators that go from street level throughout the hotel that are empty, that they reserve from the rooftop bar only and staff only. These elevators remain empty, while the others are overcrowded and make many stops. Once on that elevator you must insert your card into the slot to press your button and hope the elevator has not already started moving. Most other people in the elevators were confused and annoyed by this. In addition they put us in a room next to the elevator that was noisy and you could hear the club music coming up from in from inside the room. In addition one night there were (what sounded like 20) drunk people hanging out in our hallway, talking really loud for at least a half an hour, which isn't really the hotels fault, except the rooms were not sound proofed. Whoever designed this hotel is an idiot. ALL of the design elements are completely disjointed, and do not go together. The style over thought, all over the place and is in poor taste.

I feel as though someone took the table out and never replaced. -TV selection really small and only 1 remote was annoying -Phones did not work in the room and when told they never came to fix. Overall, I'll stay again. The restaurant, AJA is good. The check in is quick and the service is great. The rooftop is very nice. The location is awesome.

1882,8/10/2009,U2Py1d6ciLTUdkiPAlH,"This is my first yelp review of a hotel. All in all the Dana Hotel and Spa was pretty impressive and that is saying a lot coming from someone who worked as a concierge in the hotel business for the last several years. My hospitality experience set the standard pretty high for hotels to live up to but the Dana really performed. Let me first say that this hotel is not for everyone. It would certainly fall into the category of trendy/contemporary, which some people may not enjoy. Think W hotels, only a little less cheesy and without all the lame lingo. I had a king bed in my room that you could melt in. I don't know what it is like to sleep on a cloud but I would imagine it would be similar to the beds here. The shower is the portion of the room that gets a little weird. It's a spa shower and has a full window that you can look out to the rest of the room while getting so fresh and so clean. Being that I was alone during my stay, I loved this because I was able destank myself while catching a rerun of Real Chance at Love. I also think it would be very cool for a romantic getaway with a special someone, but can imagine an akward situation if I were sharing the room for a business trip or something. It would be difficult to shower in peace wondering if your random roommate, creepy Steve from accounting, was checking you out in the buff. They do have an optional curtain for more privacy, but I toggled with it and it doesn't completely protect from a bi curious George who is dying to check out what your junk looks like. The other thing about the shower that I thought was weird was that there was no door. Literally every time I cleansed myself there was water that sprayed outside the designated shower area. I don't know what is trendy or cool about getting the bathroom floor all wet? They may want to rethink that one. Other than the weird shower, the place is top notch. The location is prime and close to pretty much anything someone visiting Chicago would want to see. They don't really nickel and dime you like many other hotels either. Internet was free as was the gym. They don't have continental breakfast but give vouchers for up to $15 dollars each morning for a la carte items from the restaurant. The food there was very good and in my opinion this blows away any continental breakfast I've ever had. Many times at trendy hotels, I feel like the staff seems almost too cool for school but, I didn't get that here. The service was friendly and approachable from the bellman to the concierge. Overall it is a great place. If your looking for a hotel to hold a company retreat or something along those lines I would recommend more traditional lodging. If I was with someone I felt comfortable being seen in my birthday suit I would definitley stay here.",4,11,6,7,N,NG1SgsvSFIfrc32kbaVGOA,Brandie R.,"Austin, TX",July 2009,8,80,5,50,18,9,4,0,0,0.06734006734006734,ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ,Paris,"Paris - The Strip - Las Vegas, NV",759,3.5,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Arts & Entertainment, Casinos, METADATA","3655 Las Vegas Blvd S Las Vegas, NV 89109 Neighborhood: The Strip",Yes,$$,Paid,http://www.parislasvegas.com,(877) 603-4386,0

Beds (2 stars) are WAY too softy-plushie, no support, bad pillows and overall not nearly as comfy as the Westin. If you have a bad back or just o/w prefer a firmer mattress, do not stay here, you'll be miserable. Lighting in room (2 stars) is extremely dim, and you have to turn on/off like 5 lamps individually to get maybe 2 candles' worth of lumens. Windows (5 stars) are beautiful though, completely floor-to-ceiling so you have a great view of the city. SERVICE: 5 stars. Valets remembered my name every time I entered/exited the hotel and addressed me as such, welcoming back and forth by name. They were prompt and courteous and overall some of the best I've experienced in any travels, anywhere. RESTAURANT: 5 stars (I only had bfasts there).

FITNESS CENTER: 4 stars. I'm waffling b/w 3-4 but I'll give 'em 4. See my photos of this place, esp since the hotel website itself doesn't showcase it. Enough stuff to get a workout in, two overly fancy, overly fussy machines, but it's new and clean and has big windows and iPod plug ins.

They have a sushi bar with delicious selections of different maki rolls or nigiri. The tuna sashimi was very fresh and delish. The rooms although small are cozy and luxurious. Flat screen tvs and feather beds are a plus, while the bathroom leaves a little to be desired on the layout. The only thing blocking the shower or toilet from sight of the rest of the room is a curtain that opens from the OUTSIDE. (Make sure you aren't here with any pranksters, or you could be in for a very embarrassing moment!) Also, the only way to close the bathroom door is to slide open the clost, which I find very intrusive and impractical. Not a great design.

There is a spa with several different treatment packages, and I do look forward to taking advantage of it. The staff seems friendly and do not at all have your typical snootiness in a downtown hotel.

The shower was uh-mazing with a rain showerhead and see-thru glass wall into the bedroom.

1892,8/31/2010,NniPjAnjquZdESxXJO7iTg,"Oy, this was a hard one to rate. The abridged version is that this is a 4 star review for solo travelers and exhibitionists.  2 stars if you want to keep a little bit of mystery alive in your marriage. First the good... Beautiful hotel for a good price in a super convenient location.  If I were travelling solo, I would definitely go back.  The staff was very pleasant.  The chocolate covered fortune cookies with turn down service were a nice touch. Service at the restaurant was a little slow - but courteous and the food was good.  The fitness center equipment was more than adequate.  Others have noted the small locker rooms for the spa, but I had a decent massage and enjoyed my time there. If I were staying by myself, this would have been a 4 star review.  I'm still docking one star because I could hear traffic noise on the 18th floor and the elevators were a bit annoying, but generally - great hotel. Which brings us to the not so good... For travelers with companions, this should really be a 2 star review.  Because despite all of the nice amenities, for the love of God, what is up with the pooper? The bathroom shower has a clear glass wall looking out into the room which then looks out onto the lovely views of Chicago.  There is a curtain outside the bathroom to block the view out - or more critically, the view in - if you want a bit of privacy. I can almost give them the clear shower stall.  I can see the appeal of catching your partner washing their hair (I was travelling with my cousin, so the magic was really lost on me - but I see what they were going for). But just past the clear shower, is the clear divider to the toilet.  And there ain't nothing sexy about that.  To add insult to injury, the sliding barn door that doubles as a closet door doesn't close all of the way or stay put. And even if you close the curtain for privacy, in the middle of the night, the entire bedroom will be aglow when you flip on the bathroom light.  So your traveling companion can wake up when you flip on the light in the bathroom, and then lay in bed and listen to you pee because the frackin' door won't close?

The hardwood floors and desk made it feel like you were coming home at the end of the day...and I like that feeling. The floor-to-ceiling windows were cool (awesome views) but it got to be a pain by day two, as you have to pull down the shades if you want to take a shower, change your clothes, or do anything that you don't want the businessmen in the building next door to see :) OR if you are an exhibitionist, this is the place for you! And I'm still confused as to why the shower is glass on both sides, especially the side closest to the bed. Does someone who's sleeping NEED to see you washing your hair? The privacy curtain takes care of that problem, but I'm wondering why it was built that way originally. Based on the last two hotels that I've stayed in for work, The Curtis and its talking elevators (""I seee youuu"") and now the sexy shower at the Dana... what kind of job did I just sign up for?

SPA - MASSAGE:  The massage I asked for was a deep tissue massage.  She asked what I wanted the focus on, I said back.   The pressure was too weak.  She spent too much time on the legs and arms and not what I asked for which was my back.   Definitely a waste of money. SPA -FACIAL: I got the microdermabrasion facial. It was OK, But very poor on extractions. SPA facilities- poor, the lockers did not work, I had to switch two times before one worked to lock properly.  The lockers were way to small for winter wear.  There are not enough sink area in the women's spa.  There is not makeup seat area.  The sitting room was too small for the amount of people. The spa handlers did not care or notice that there was not enough room in the seating room. The SPA was very disappointing. However, the HOTEL and Club (Vertigo) were ok,pretty nice. HOTEL- TRANQUILITY SUITE - rm 901 Bathroom- The bathroom mirrors with the built in lights are great.  However, there was no makeup seat in there.  Don't they think what a lady would like? The Shower was very large with two benches.  It is a shower for two and it would have been wonderful if the side jets were working, but they were not.  The water pressure on the handheld jet was extreme and I loved it.

First off, the good stuff -- yes, the staff is very hip and pretty friendly, at least at the door and while you're checking in... And the place has a very cool look to it (actually reminds me of my favorite sushi restaurant out in Batavia - Swordfish -- but I digress)... But when you look at things a little closer, it all kind of falls apart a bit. The waitstaff in the downstairs bar, the first floor restaurant, and even the rooftop all seem to be fighting both an urge to be nice when they meet you with a deep desire to run away. For example, at breakfast in the morning, one poor busboy was running around like a madman, cleaning tables, filling coffee cups, and seating people. All while a waiter struggled to figure out how to split a check. I watched one table get their breakfasts from 2 different food runner, then they waited for at least 3 more visits from runners to their table to finish bringing their toast, their fresh fruit - etc. All while the waiter continued to poke at the touch screen. Breakfast was good, by the way. We went to the rooftop bar, where at 5pm there was already cigarette butts on the floor around the outdoor firepit, and the carpet by the stairs was so sticky I had to laugh -- this is a place where you have to reserve a table for bottle service? Four drinks at 5pm at the rooftop bar = $80 The rooms are okay, but some details seem very weird, like the unfinished concrete ceilings. Really? And the huge glassed in shower with the curtain that almost covers the glass -- and the shower head that blows out so much water I realized why they had concrete ceilings and floors (whatever happened to water conservation?)... But by far the scariest part of the whole deal was when we realized that EVERYONE going up to that rooftop bar takes an elevator that could and often does stop on any floor in the hotel. So much for hotel security... Overall, I think maybe I'm not their demographic -- maybe if you're a spa kind of person, this place is very special.

Before my first treatment, they took me to the relaxation room, which is kind of an oxymoron because you're stuck in a very very dimly lit room with other people in robes, and it's anything but relaxing.  Worries like, ""am I exposing any bits & pieces,"" etc.  There are some magazines but it's so dark I'm not sure how you're expected to read them. My first treatment was a massage.  It was heavenly...  The pressure was just right and I really liked whatever lotion/oil that was used, because I didn't feel slimy and gross at the end like you sometimes do after a massage.  From there, I had a facial.  I'd never had one before, and I have to say it was my favorite part of the package.  I didn't do anything special, just a regular ""refresher"" since I have relatively sensitive skin.  The woman who did my facial was really good about asking about skin allergies and whatnot.  The facial was very relaxing, too (minus the extraction part).   After my facial, I had a mani/pedi.  Unfortunately, this was my least favorite part of the treatment.  Maybe because I get them regularly and my experience was just standard at the Dana?  Honestly, I prefer my regular neighborhood salon to my experience at the Dana.  The woman went a little overboard with the bubbles; it actually felt like my feet were soaking in Dawn.  Also, the scrub was done really quickly--kind of felt like I got ripped off on that part.  The manicure was just okay, too.   One other thing to note, I'm not sure where, but I somehow got jipped in terms of time.  It was supposed to be a 3.5 hour package, and I was out of there in just 3 hours (maybe even a little less).  The massage and facial felt like they took ample time, so I have a feeling it was the mani/pedi that were a little shorter than advertised.",4,0,0,0,N,no3RZSi0TWUSPNXBf2xR8Q,Morgan Hooray for most things!

The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. I wish my house looked like this. I got a free voucher for breakfast and took advantage of it every morning. The Dana Breakfast (eggs benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham) was amazing. The fruit smoothie was only okay, but good for breakfast on the go. I also ordered food from room service and it was very good. The door person always remembered my name (even days later) and was very friendly. Overall, I experienced great service. Finally, I took advantage of the spa for a hot stone massage. My therapist (Dana) was nice but not chatty and totally professional. It was a good massage, but not the best I've ever had.

I can agree with much of what's been said by other reviewers both good and bad: comfy beds, great location, very friendly staff, cool modern rooms, etc.; lack of windows in rooms with basically useless ""balconies"", issues with room temperature, frustrations with the keys and the various elevators, etc. That said, the biggest reason I have to mark this place down is, again as others have mentioned, the paper thin doors and walls. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night when people were out enjoying themselves and coming back fairly late. No big deal. But even at normal talking volumes, not yelling, it sounded like anyone in the hall was actually in our room. It was impossible to sleep. Even the sirens outside sounded much louder than seemed normal. I actually tried shoving pillows at the bottom of the door to dampen the sound. It helped a little, but didn't really help us sleep (since it was still pretty loud and we were now short a couple pillows).

1915,8/16/2010,60Z3WMKSpR9QHSlXJmp2HQ,"(NOTE: REVIEW FOR SPA ONLY) A friend and I decided that we wanted to treat ourselves to massages. It was a last minute decision so we called around until we found open appointments. This is how we ended up at The Spa at the Dana Hotel. When we arrived, we stepped off the elevator onto the Spa level and so far, we liked what we saw. The waiting area and hallways were very tranquil looking and contemporary. We checked in and we were told that we could use the stream room in the locker area before our massages. Having had massages at other Spa's, like Bliss (or The Elysian, Peninsula, Exhale, Urban Oasis, etc.), we were really excited to use the locker room amenities. Upon entering, we lost our excitement. The locker rooms here are tiny. Two restrooms, one small steam shower and maybe three showers. On the counter was one hair dryer and typical spa amenities - a few razors, some mouthwash, toothbrush/toothpaste, comb, deodorant and lotion. The atmosphere was nothing special. It was sort of a mess, even though no one else was in there. The ceiling was peeling and there were black stains on the wall (um, mold?!). We were disappointed. Needless to say, we didn't spend too much time in the locker room. We put on our robes and walked to the ""relaxation"" room, a dimly lit room with a few chairs and chaises to sit in while you wait for your masseuse. We were served strawberry-cucumber infused water. They had magazines and fruit to enjoy. The room was comfortable, but we still felt like we wouldn't want to see it with the lights turned all the way up. With all that being said, the massages were pretty decent. We booked 50 minute, $90 Swedish massages. The massage tables were comfortable, the masseuse was friendly and I did leave feeling relaxed. Would I go back to the The Spa at The Dana Hotel? Probably not. With all of the massage options in the city, I'd probably stretch my wallet to go somewhere else or spend my $90 in another way.

The lobby, the lobby bar and the adjacent restaurant are all small and relatively quiet, but definitely have a ton of style.  In fact, the entire hotel was far too cool for me, specifically, and probably too cool for most of humanity. The Tranquility Suite was simply awesome-- 2 rooms (a bedroom and a huge living room), 2 tiny balconies with amazing views (ask for a higher floor unless you have severe vertigo), and a nice bathroom with an unbelievable shower for two.  Seriously, this room offered the best shower imaginable-- complete with 2 rain-style shower heads, 2 benches (for the ladies of course), a set of high-powered jets, and a handheld thingy that spits out mad amounts of water.  This shower is definitely not ""green"", but it's the sort of place that makes you not want to leave.  Finally, the bedding is tremendous-- it's hard to imagine feeling more comfortable in a hotel bed.

1920,6/6/2009,R6fvEEGmcLSCPh1wgc6Nrw,"I have to admit that I was pretty stoked about my stay here after reading all of the reviews. I'm a sucker for a great hotel. Check-in was a breeze, although I'm really not a fan of the whole ""let's put your whole stay on hold on your credit card when you get here to cover incidentals"" policy. That certainly isn't fun for those of us on strict budgets, although I guess that's not the typical patron at the Dana. I absolutely LOVED the mosaic behind the check in desk, and would kind of like it for my apartment, please. Thank you. My stay at the Dana (for 5 whole nights) was overall a pleasure. Todd, the bartender downstairs, took great care of us on a VERY regular basis and would whip my Hendrick's and tonic up without having to ask. God, I loved that bar. Comfortable seating, free tasty fried wontons, and Hendrick's gin. Love. Who cares if it's $10 a cocktail, right? My room was a study in form over function. The desk space was great and I used it often. The bed was comfortable, although it didn't hold a candle to the palatial heavenly beds at the Westin. My main beef was with the bathroom. As others have mentioned, the shower is all glass and opens up to your room, which is fine for those of us who travel solo. Just have to put the blinds down, and as someone who loves to live by natural light, that became a pain. The other side of the shower has NOTHING. No door, no glass, so you're just open to the bathroom, resulting in water flying everywhere. Maybe I'm just a really sloppy shower-er, but I felt really bad for housekeeping who had to deal with my sopping wet bathmat. It also led to things getting pretty drafty, which I could  imagine being a serious issue come cold Chicago winter. Finally, the rain-style showerhead. I know these are all the rage, but I don't like them. As someone who doesn't wash my hair every day (but still likes to shower) it provides some difficulty. Sure, they've still got the handheld thing, but who the hell wants to use that? Plus, it added even more to the mess beyond the shower walls. It wasn't pretty. Finally, be sure not to get a room across from the elevator (rooms that end in 08 or 10). You will here the dinging all.night.long. Not to mention all the folks that chat it up while waiting for the lift to arrive. Not fun if you like extreme peace and quiet. Would I come back to the Dana?

1921,2/21/2011,ABEWAQ4dx8OosIypS8ZUIQ,"Oh my goodness! I had the best experience at the Dana Hotel. I want to mention that I did not go to the SPA (though I hope to in the future!) so this is a review for the hotel only. For my birthday this year my boyfriend decided to do a special ""date night"" downtown. He is really good at planning things like this and after a lot of research he decided on Dana Hotel for our place to stay. When we arrived they valeted our car. Every staff person that we interacted with was helpful and friendly. The decor of the hotel is very beautiful and modern. There was a huge tour group checking in when we arrived so the manager took us aside to get us checked in. They also have self serve kiosks for check in. Our room was not ready so they set us up with a free drink at the bar while we waited. I thought that was really good customer service. The room was AH-mazing. If you decide to stay there I highly suggest that you choose a corner room. The first thing that hits you when you walk in are the floor to ceiling windows. The beds are so comfy and plush, the bathroom is awesome and has a rain shower! I took 4 showers and was only there one night. It has all the amenity's of a nice hotel, robe and slippers, nice bath products, etc. We also liked that it had an awesome ipod docking station with really good speakers. Overall it was an amazing room and well worth the price of $160. We had stayed at a holiday inn express a couple weeks before which cost $100 per night. $60 more for this room was a great deal if you ask me. We stayed in January so I am guessing the price might be more in a peak season? While we were there we also went to the roof top bar. It was really cool, not too crowded, and there was an outdoor patio with an ice bar! I also liked that there was a fire pit to sit around with complimentary robes to wear, so you could sit by the fire outside on the roof and not be cold. There were a few things to be aware of, though it wouldn't make me drop my rating. The valet is $40 per night and when you get the room charge they add tax. The drinks at the bar are really expensive, $15 or more for a cocktail. So keep that in mind.

1922,9/2/2008,WkT0wv,"My fiance and I decided to have a little faux-getaway on Sunday night. Although we live only a few blocks from the Dana, we thought it would be a fun way to close out the summer to book a hotel, do the whole spa thing, shop Michigan avenue like tourists, and enjoy some of the things in Chicago that we take for granted since we live here. We had high hopes for our stay and were excited to get a move on, Sunday morning. Upon booking, we were told that check-in is 3PM (normal) but that we should have no problem having our room by 12-1. We got to the hotel about 1230 and were told they sold out the night before and we'd have to wait until 3 for our room. Not their fault, totally understood, so we left our bags with the bellman and went shopping. My fiance had booked a massage earlier in the week for 2PM and at about 1PM she called to see if she could get a last minute manicure after her spa treatment. The manicurists were booked (understandable) but she was also told they had no record of her massage!?!?! - this had been confirmed by phone a day earlier. The massage was one of the things she was most looking forward to, so after a brief phone argument, we marched back to the hotel to get it straightened out. Luckily they ""found her reservation"" and she was off to her massage. I went back out to do some shopping and met up with her at 3PM to check in. We were told the room STILL wasnt ready, but somehow they managed to find us one that fit our reservation. The room was what we expected, small, but modern and cool. The IPOD system was excellent and the bed was super comfy. We requested a room with a balcony as opposed to their floor to ceiling windows - either way the hotel is very open with regards to people in neighboring buildings being able to see in and we received welcoming waves from people across the way. Luckily the blackout blinds do the trick in securing some privacy. I'm thinking that the upcoming portion of my review on Ajasteak should go under the restaurant, so if you happen to read something on that page that seems oddly familiar, you'll know why. Going into the restaurant, I had moderate expectations given that its fairly new and some of the reviews seemed ""eh"". We had an 8PM reservation and were clearly on time since we were just an elevator away. When we arrived, we were told they werent ready for us yet and to enjoy a cocktail at the bar - should be 15-20 minutes. I looked into what I assumed was the restaurant and there were only two tables out of probably 15 occupied and a few parties eating outside. I assumed there was another section of the restaurant that couldnt be seen from the bar area, but when we were seated in what turned out to be the empty restaurant I was BAFFLED. I ran to the bathroom when we were seated (have to take elevator/stairs to 2nd floor bathroom, none on restaurant level) - but the manager came to the table and apologized to my fiance for the wait - apparently they were extremely short staffed, backed up in the kitchen, and had a private party ""upstairs"". New restaurant kinks or shitty service??? The menu was on par with what I expected. We started with edamame (decent, but kind of flavorless) and the Kobe beef yakatori. I'm SO GLAD I opted for the Kobe beef appetizer as opposed to the $18 per oz entree as it was REALLY sub-par. It was served with mini-skewer/toothpicks to eat it with and kind of came across as something that would be served as passed appetizers at a cocktail party. Unimpressive. My fiance ordered the sea bass which she generally loves.Sea bass isnt normally a ""fishy"" fish and it is usually hearty/fluffy. However, her piece was pounded so thin, it was almost laughable and it was drenched in the terriyaki sauce (which although tasty) seemed an intentional overpowering of the sub-par fish. I opted for the lamb chops and upon ordering told the server that although I enjoy my steaks medium rare, I prefer lamb cooked a bit more and he acknowledged my request - OF COURSE, the lamb came out pretty much rare and both chops had a big visible piece of fat through the middle. This was a $40 dish that was worth 1/2 that, if that. I ate it because at that point I was starving. We also shared the ""truffle"" mashed potatoes which didnt have a hint of truffle flavor and tasted more like the buttered flavor out of the bag instant mashed potatoes found at the local Jewel for $0.89. Dismal. Clearly, we didnt stick around for dessert. Fortunately, my fiance and I know how to have fun even when faced with some shitty circumstances, so although on paper the overall experience of the Dana seems terrible, we made the best of it. When we left, our first thought was, ""We're so F'in happy the Dana wasnt opened last year when we booked our wedding at the James hotel"". On the surface the Dana seems to have every thing we like - spa, cool, modern decor, location, trendy restaurant, etc - but they definitely missed the mark with us.",2,2,0,1,N,OurVSa2DwA4Kb8fHzTVF5g,Anna Banana H.,"Naperville, IL",February 2009,13,23,0,10,6,4,2,0,0,0.0171898355754858,d31GkGRGdB_g0E1xFliXpQ,Experience The Felax,"Experience The Felax - Addison - Addison, TX",20,4.5,"Beauty and Spas, Massage, METADATA","4943 Belt line Rd Addison, TX 75254 Neighborhood: Addison",Yes,$$,None,http://thefelax.com,(972) 385-7109,0
1923,7/5/2009,fqYlUhbsp38DnnJ9vygKEQ,"My wife, who just so happens to be named Dana, spent our first weekend alone since our first child was born eight weeks ago. I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews. I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests. 1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didn't seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway. 2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend. 3. If possible, an upper level room with a view. Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically ""We're booked, too bad"". When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldn't be a problem, their response was again ""Your room doesn't come with a refrigerator, too bad."" I've never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasn't exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend. Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again. POSITIVES 1. Location. You can't beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife ... You are right in the middle of all of it. 2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place. 3. Shower. It's a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. It's about as nice of a hotel bathroom as you're going to find. 4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good. 5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine. NEGATIVES 1. Front desk. I've already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting. 2. Elevator. This might sound like I'm being picky, but I can't tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done. It's almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. It's incredibly annoying and if you don't do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotel's way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off. 3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isn't the hotel for you. 4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. It's not young by any means and it's not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter. 5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you it's on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, I'll be impressed. There are a lot of things at this hotel where you just scratch your head and think, what the @#$% were they thinking?",3,3,0,0,N,Nfw-p_zoF3stqE0m889zpA,Mitch the Griff G.,"Carbondale, IL",June 2010,15,26,3,16,6,2,1,1,1,0.03048065650644783,SCHXviAxcROEUzLJbt4EfQ,Pho Noodle and Grill Express,"Pho Noodle and Grill Express - Carrollton - Carrollton, TX",22,3.0,"Restaurants, Vietnamese, METADATA","2012 E Belt Line Rd Carrollton, TX 75011 Neighborhood: Carrollton",Yes,$,No,None,None,0

And one point, it wouldn't work for a bellman. The elevator wouldn't allow me to go to the Vertigo room either.. That was frustrating and I tried both days. I didn't ask the staff for help b/c like I said, they didnt really seem that helpful. I did love the comfy king room. The bed itself felt like heaven.

1926,9/26/2009,Ve8sYBlC9wReVGz93tPoKQ,"Overall, my wife and I were pretty pleased with Dana, the room, the spa and the restaurant downstairs.  Not to mention the friendly and helpful staff.  We stayed in the Tranquility Suite for two nights (Fri/Sat), parked our car with the valet, partook in a variety of spa treatments, ordered room service, used the in room honor bar, and also had dinner and breakfast at Aja, the restaurant downstairs. The Room (4 Stars): Price was reduced by 15% b/c we stayed two nights.  We also got 60 dollars credit toward breakfast in their restaurant when we arrived.  Nice surprise and bonus.  Decor is pretty cool and the rooms are unique and spacious. The Italian Rain Shower totally rocks and having the sitting room in the Tranquility Suite was really worth it. Plugged in our iPhones to the speaker dock and enjoyed our music.  Fair prices for the bottles of wine in the room and a decent selection from the small frig (though adding small bottles of some liquors would have been nice).  Having two balconies was pretty cool, especially to have some air flow through the room.  Window treatments block the sun really well, like really really well.  Downside  - Bed was too soft and we did not sleep as well both nights.  Balconies are good to have a smoke on and take some pictures but other than that there's not much room and you have to pull a small chair out there if you want to enjoy it. My guess is that liability and insurance dictated this...oh well. Just don't look forward to a real balcony.  Very limited cable television with Showtime that's not HD even though the room has two widescreen flat panel TVs.  Also, you can't order movies to watch in your room because they don't have the service. Aja (the restaurant) (5 stars) - Pretty chique decor, fairly priced (on the higher end) and good quality food.  For dinner I ordered some salmon sushi rolls and sashimi and they were both very good (and I'm reeeeeal picky 'bout my sushi).  My wife did the pork chop and mashed potatoes...and they were both delicious.  Pork chop was a large portion as were the mashed potatoes.  We also had a bottle of Silver Oaks' Merlot to celebrate ($108 and well worth it, great Merlot).  Then we had their apple desert that was both beautifully presented and nicely balanced in size, flavor and freshness.  Our server was great too.  Really personable, fun to joke around with and down to earth.  Some staff members/servers seemed a little uptight or anxious and I'm wondering if that might be a reflection of how they're managed...?  Breakfasts were a little high priced for me but having the 15 dollar credit, 1 for each of us, we were happy to go down.  Again, very fresh and good quality food.  Locks were flavorful, Eggs benedict had a fresher flavor as they increased the amount of lemon (which I welcomed) and their potatoes were very delicious.  Refrain from ordering the pancakes unless you want to feed 4-5 people.  For some reason they give you two that are two times the size of a large dining plate...no joke, it's friggin' ridiculous. Hope they change it. The Spa (3.5 Stars) - My wife and I had the couples message and pedicures together.  She also had a manicure and facial.  She really enjoyed her massage and I did as well although I have some hefty knots in my shoulders so I was sore and a little bruised the next day.  Overall, it was a good experience but speak up if they're doing it too hard and if their nails are scratching you.  The bed you lay on is heated, super comfy and dark lit room and the oils that they use are pretty nice.  You also sit in a relaxing room before and after to chill out.  Pedicures were pretty good though we felt a little misled because the woman recommended treatments but did not tell us that they weren't included and that we'd be charged extra so watch out for that.  Besides that it was pretty good.  Quality of the nail polish and durability was a little questionable.  Seemed to wear off pretty quickly and she rushed through it a bit.  Again, pretty good with room for improvement.  My wife really enjoyed the manicure (same rating and experience as the pedicure) and LOVED the facial (she got the Antioxidant/Nutrient facial). Parking, Concierge, Room Service and Bell Hop (4.5 Stars): the staff was really nice here.  Pleasant, helpful, talkative and personable.  When we pulled up to the hotel we did not have to do much. We were greeted immediately, given a ticket for our car for valet, they removed out luggage immediately, placed it on a cart and took it upstairs while we checked in.  A little delay on the checkout but that's because many people were doing so all at once.  Same great service.  Room service was easy and has food 24 hours, which really impressed us.  Prices are a bit high but that's no big surprise.  We were happy to pay considering their prices on other things were pretty reasonable.  Concierge was more than helpful in making reservations at Aja for us.",4,0,0,0,N,p_8knSV8TzChRYXcFZC7jA,Shannon W.,"River Forest, IL",August 2008,0,26,2,11,4,3,1,0,0,0.017082785808147174,hJkyAppjy92k3jRAjniyww,Buffalo Wild Wings,"Buffalo Wild Wings - Addison - Addison, TX",55,3.0,"Restaurants, American (Traditional), Chicken Wings, METADATA","5000 Belt Line Road #100 Addison, TX 75001 Neighborhood: Addison",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.buffalowildwings.com/,(972) 701-9464,0

The first night the maid turned down the beds and pulled the shades, but neglected to pull the blackout shades; an important feature when you are in an east facing room...and we didn't know to do it ourselves.  The second night, they were pulled, but the maid threw the pillows on the chair next to them so there was a nice crack for that sun to peek through, right into my friends eyes.   A nice touch is that they give you coupons for a made to order breakfast in their downstairs restaurant - valued at $15.00.  So in the morning we went downstairs for breakfast...it was busy...we waited...once we sat...we waited...and waited...can someone PLEASE bring us some coffee???? Oh, sure...we waited...and waited...can we say, the service was slow?  Yes, yes we can.  The food was mostly good; again a couple of missteps and inconsistencies; I assume the kitchen makes their poached eggs in advance, using the method of putting the egg into an ice bath to hold it until service and then putting it into hot water to warm and finish cooking; it's an important step, that putting it back into hot water; when it's not done, the egg is a cold as ice.  As was the eggs on my friend's Eggs Benedict. However, the poached eggs on my other friends plate were hot. This was, however, something that was quickly corrected.  The second morning was no better than the first on service...it was slow, and worse, it's like they are ignoring you.  They don't even make eye contact.  That morning I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy...let me say this...clearly...DON'T...it's not Biscuits and Gravy, it's a biscuit in some white stuff with some slices of sausage and mushrooms...that's just not right.   I do want to give a shout out to TJ and the guy with the Tats, (sorry can't remember your name) you guys were great!

The air conditioner seemed to work fine, although it was not extremely warm while we were there. The hotel had a very aged feel to it, but my expectations for an 1890's era building were far surpassed. The housekeeping staff was very nice. They quietly knocked at the door around 8 am every morning, but we had to turn them away as we were preparing to venture out into the city. Each of the 3 days we stayed, we returned to find things tidied up and cleaned very well. Nothing was out of place in anyway. We dealt with two separate concierges and another desk clerk who were all friendly and helpful. There were only two things that distressed me about my stay.

The Congress Plaza Hotel is a total crap hole (yes, that is the technical term). Having lived on the south side previously, it's not the neighborhood that gets me. It's the fact that the hotel is full of employees who don't want to be there (scabs, by the way... The real employees have been on strike for years, and they picket in front every day), classless hotel guests, and security personnel who look like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, complete with the post-being-in-the-saddle waddling they do. I (luckily) only crashed in a friend's hotel room there during the conference I was attending, but I wouldn't have paid for a room there. They're dirty, the views are terrible, and the hallways are oddly-shaped and confusing. It's like a labyrinth when you get inside. At 1AM, I was standing in the lobby with a gin and tonic when all of a sudden a man ran past me gushing blood out of some orifice in his face (It might have been his nose or eye, or a hole that had recently appeared judging by the amount of blood it had pouring out of it). He ran into the elevator, which he then proceeded to cover in blood as well. To ""outrun"" the security guards who were now chasing him around, he got off at around the 8th floor, called the OTHER elevator, then took that one back down to the lobby and ran outside, covering both elevators, as well as the entire hotel lobby with blood. That was the highlight of my evening... Hiking up the 12 flights to get back to the room I was staying in because both elevators were covered in hemoglobin. Last, the security guard from the hotel, having seen me in the lobby during the blood fiasco, figured out which room I was going into and had me LOCKED OUT of it so he could question me when I ran up the stairs. He had to go override the lock to make the keys work again. I think that was probably illegal. That's when I gathered my belongings and took the hour-long train ride home instead of staying with my friend again. The CP hotel tries to be high class, but they really aren't. They're notorious for charging huge amounts for ""amazing suites"" that really aren't that great. For the same money, you could go to a real hotel and not be harassed by the people on strike every time you walk in the front door by someone who's been unemployed and striking for 3 years.

But it's clear where they cut corners to save money. The beds were nice but there were only foam pillows. There were plenty of towels (once we asked) but they were relatively small, very thin and pretty scratchy. The shower curtain was hung on a straight tension rod that was too far INTO the tub - and of course, it came down when I tried to move it away so as not to have the plastic curtain plastered to my, er, behind as I showered. I got it into the right place with the help of my roommate. The rooms are SPACIOUS but the view (on the 5th floor) was of a massive concrete wall - a little ""view"" of brick buildings when you looked straight up. The worst part was the musty smell, and the old-ness. When I went to adjust the thermostat/fan, the little metal ""flap"" revealed filth/stickiness/cobwebs inside, I didn't want to touch the knobs. Our closet (we were in #547) was big and roomy, but our adjoining room (#551) had a weird DOOR that started about 4' off the ground and was probably 3 or 4' tall. Inside (of course we looked!) were old pipes and cobwebs and some trash at the bottom. I believe this was access to plumbing. We think the worst of the smells came from behind that door. So we took everything out of the closet in 551 and moved it to 547, as we had both rooms and the door in between stayed unlocked. There were layers and layers of paint on all of the wood (except the new wood molding along the floor in 551 that had not yet been painted), and much of the paint was peeling. The bathroom was updated but the handicap bar between the sink and the commode was a great place to stub ones toes - it's just in a weird place. The carpet was ornate but old, made me wonder when it was cleaned last. Wish I'd brought my slippers! Other friends had a big ""double room"" on the 13th floor that had no smell. A big room with a king bed, and a separate room with a double bed. The separate room was teeny tiny but it did have a window and it's own flat screen TV, but no furniture, just the bed. I think that room number was 1381/1381A. Haunted?

1972,1/2/2012,jy1Nq3QFXB3KlevBcrD6zw,"AVOID THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL AT ALL COSTS! When we arrived there, the building architecture was undoubtedly fascinating, it soon became obvious that the hotel is not being properly maintained. Setting the dirty carpets and dark, dirty, hallways aside, our first disturbing discovery was an unlocked door on the 7th floor next to the vending area. This unlocked door opens into a shaft used for plumbing and other infrastructure, however, one, especially, a child, could easily fall down to the lower floors and be seriously injured or killed. It shocks me that the hotel can remain in operation with such serious safety hazards. At approximately 11:20 p.m., we discovered a BED BUG in the bed in one of our rooms! We immediately gathered the evidence, took pictures, and called the front desk. The front desk did not seem surprised by our discovery and acted as if we were inconveniencing them! The front desk sent a security officer to the room at approximately 11:40 p.m., who also did not act surprised. The officer had us fill out a security report and took pictures of the bug. The security officer advised us that the manager will move one room. Since we had three rooms on the floor, two of which were adjoining rooms, we went to the front desk, with the bug, to request that all of our rooms are moved. Again, the night manager acted as if we were inconveniencing him. He first advised us that the hotel was almost to capacity and that we would not get three rooms together on another floor. Like magic, however, the new rooms that we received were all in the same hallway, on the same floor, two of which were again adjoining! We checked our new rooms thouroughly for any bed bugs and did not find any. We then went to bed, but did not get much sleep with the thought that bed bugs could be just feet away. What a way to spend New Year's Eve! The next morning, I called American Express Travel to report the issue. After an hour of busy signals and getting disconnected, I eventually spoke with a supervisor, explained the issue, and requested a full refund for our three rooms. The AmEx supervisor called the hotel's manager on duty, Francine, on a three-way call. Francine said that she would call me back shortly with more information. She never called me back and I went to the front desk to follow-up. She said that she was authorized by the hotel's general manager, Shakeel Siddiqu to refund one room and I reported that it was unacceptable. We asked her to call Shakeel back and explain the situation again. She went into the office and supposedly called him back, however, I do not believe that she did. She again said that they would refund one room and would need to call American Express Travel to discuss the issue further. I then asked for a copy of the security report that was filed the night before. She told me that the security office would not give her a copy, but they would give me a copy. I proceeded to the security office in the basement of the hotel and was told that they would not give me a copy of the report until it was reviewed by the director of security. The security personnel is a total joke and more concerned with pointing out wrongs in their colleagues than helping customers. They provided the report number only and said that they would fax the report later. Ultimately, it is obvious that the hotel's lack of concern for its guests stems directly from the hotel's shady owners and all the way through the incompetent management. I do not think a single member of their staff has any idea was customer service is. I also doubt they know they are working in a service industry! After checking out of the hotel, I performed some due dilligence on the hotel. I wish I would have done so before our stay, rather than trusting American Express Travel. I found that our story is not by any means new or isolated.

1974,6/14/2010,OoCcQppmjRFvggpGTVz7oA,"In a desperate situation to secure downtown Chicago hotel room for a recent work conference I was thrilled to land a 'lake view king' accommodation at the Congress Hotel. Due to the late nature of my reservation and the time frame I needed to be in Chicago, I don't think I would have found an alternative to the Congress Hotel even if I had read the Yelp warnings about this place. Let me start by saying that the one star rating is low for the location; located right on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park you are in a great spot for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants. That said, the one star rating is much too high for the Congress Hotel itself. Upon pulling up to the hotel we had to dodge a picket line and were essentially verbally assaulted by a rude valet who only said to ""immediately unload our car"" so he could ""get it out of the way"". Nice. Check in went smooth and the view from our room was incredible. Unfortunately that view would only be ours until we realized the toilet did not work at all, unless you call flooding the bathroom and room entrance working. Our first call to the front desk to request a move to a new room was met with, ""we will send up someone to repair and clean."" Repair and clean translated into a guy with a plunger and a woman with a bucket, spray bottle and paper towels. Not acceptable. Our second call, with some stronger language, resulted in a move to a double bed special with a brick wall view. So much for the view. It was in that room that we noticed the cheap furniture which was essentially broken, gouged and dusty. Nice. As far as the food goes, just stay away, the Gazebo restaurant for breakfast at was terrible as was the service. All this for the price of approximately $260 per night...what a deal! It is a shame to see what the current owners have done to this once grand hotel. It is clear that the place must have been a spectacular place to stay back in its day.

1975,11/26/2007,SwBCKs5vA9kBivIWS5fZ8g,"There was a time when I would have given the Congress Plaza an affectionate two-star review, but those days are long gone. My last stay was one of the most horrible hotel stays I've ever had, and I've stayed in the Ramada Inn in Inglewood, CA! The problem with Congress Plaza is, they have two seperate wings. The original wing is mostly okay. The rooms are really old, but most are roomy and the dilapidated nature is part of the charm. The ""Buckingham Wing"", which was apparently a value hotel next door bought out by the Congress some years ago, and never renovated, is a f-cking NIGHTMARE, however, and you have no say about which wing/room you stay in. In my four stays at Congress, one was in a decent room, the other three were hellish. One of the rooms I stayed in had a broken air conditioner (this was in the dead of summer, mind you) with STANDING WATER inside where the temp control knob was! I also saw tiny worms crawling on the bathroom floor of that room. Another room had a hole burned into the carpet in the shape of an iron and what looked to be arterial spray from a murder across the box spring. There are also regularly yellowish cum stains on the white bedding. Honestly, I'm surprised that I haven't contracted something or come down with a case of crabs after sleeping in their disgusting beds. Staff is rude, you have to cross a picket line to get in the door (the strike has been going on for almost five years, now, too--with no end in sight), the in-house restaurant is a TOTAL joke (they misspelled ""toasted bagel"" on their menu--it read ""tasted bagel"" instead...maybe it wasn't a misspelling...I wouldn't put pre-tasting the food past their crack kitchen staff) and they also offer an option to pay extra for a ""room with a view"". DON'T DO IT! The time I did that was when they stuck me in a reeking, disgusting room in the Buckingham Wing that had duct tape on the walls, a door that adjoined to someone elses' room through which you could hear talking and other noises, and burn marks on the carpeting. Nice location, but they need to sell this place to someone who cares and renovate the ENTIRE hotel. I've stayed in Super 8's that were much nicer. Adding insult to injury--IT'S TOTALLY EXPENSIVE!

1976,3/18/2011,QwPAK4s-n6kjS,For the price and location of the hotel it is decent. Though as other reviews have suggested. The hotel does need to update its image completely. Stepping into the hotel it will remind you of 1940 opulence but without the glamour. If you are in a pinch this is a decent place to spend a night. Also make sure to get a room facing the park otherwise you will be looking into somebody else's room or into the middle of nothing.

1984,10/20/2010,czFvh9Gq7tJC1wwJ9R937A,"I couldn't have been more unhappy with my stay at the Congress Plaza Hotel. Check-in went all right, although I'm still pretty sure that the check-in woman at the front desk never looked up from typing, she was short and rude while assigning me a room key - not the way you want your guests to see a first impression.     After getting to our room, we discovered that even though it's an old hotel, they had upgraded their TV's, to probably 26 inch flat screens, a nice touch. Only then to discover that THERE IS NO HEAT IN THE ROOM. After realizing I could not control the temperature in the room, I phoned the front desk and ask about the heat and I was rudely informed ""there's no heat in the entire building."" This is Chicago, and even in October it's cold, I can't imagine anyone staying in this hotel in the Winter - you will spend all your time under the covers or in the shower.     That brings me to the shower. The shower head was detached from the wall, hanging 2-3 inches off the wall (as in broken, not by design). The water pressure was more like a leaky pipe. Also it took forever to get the water warm (like 5 minutes) and I mean warm, not hot, it was never hot.     I tried to get a late check out as we wanted to walk around the city for a while before our flight out later in the day and they would not accommodate that, a fairly common request among hotel guests. We had to check out by the time given, and were told we could leave our luggage with the bell hop for free while we toured the city.     After checking out at the front desk, I was directed to the bell hop station to check my luggage. After waiting in line for 25 minutes I set my bags down to be checked - the bell hop asked if one of my bags was a computer to which I said ""yes."" He then rudely told me I could not store my computer there, that I would have to go to the front desk and have it checked by security. I asked him why no one at the front desk had bothered to tell me this when I checked out and asked where to check my things, and he responded ""that's not my job!"" I explained to him that I was aware of that, but a friendly suggestion to let the front desk people know that would go far with the guests. He literally got in my face, told me he didn't like my attitude and refused to check my bag. Mind you, I was upset, but I was not yelling, nor was I raising my voice or being out of line.     I then walked to the front desk, explained the situation to the 6 girls chatting behind the front desk and they stared at me like I was from outer-space. The one girl who handled my check out said ""well how was I supposed to know you had a computer?"" I responded with ""why don't you just tack on to everyone you tell about the baggage check, ""also, if you have a computer with you, we need to store it in a separate room with Security."" I am not joking, it's like I was trying to teach them complex math equations, they stared at me blankly like they didn't understand customer service. Security finally came and stored my bags for me. Mind you, I don't have a problem with storing laptops separately, in fact I think it's a great idea considering their baggage check is right next to the front door which is easily accessible to thieves. I just had a problem with no one taking any responsibility and not one hotel employee showing any care for customer service.     I apologize for this being so long winded, but I felt this was a story that needed to be told. I'm 32 years old, I'm not some old man who just complains about everything. I stay in dozens of hotels all year long, and this by far was the worst experience I've had in probably 10 years.

Summary: *  Bed.  Felt like a thin mattress sitting on a wooden board, and angled with feet higher than head; *  Noise.  Room was very poorly insulated from noise.  On the last night, we heard our neighbors arrive after midnight, argue - though only speaking loudly and not screaming - for several hours.  We could make out phrases and words fairly clearly  Additionally, the previous neighbor, we could hear clear words when spoke on the phone; *  Housekeeping cleaning neighbors at 7.30 am.  Given poor noise insulation, this woke me up on Sunday morning.  Not appropriate to be cleaning rooms at 7.30 am, unless some kind of emergency; *  Storage shortage.  No dresser, only few drawers in nightstand.  Heard fellow conference goers complain of the same experience in their rooms, respectively.  Bathroom had a tiny, glass shelf above the toilet and about 4-6"" of flat space next to the sink basin.  Towel bar - only one in the entire bathroom, and two, small, rob hooks; *  Parking.  $52/day!  Really?  Yes, I've paid that amount in Manhattan.  But, it seems steep for Chicago.  Even on Wacker; *  Taxi cab shortage.  On a rainy, Friday night, the cab line took about 30 min.  It was reportedly this way for much of the afternoon / evening.  Really?  If this is the City's largest hotel (as they told us when we checked in), and it positions itself as a premium property, shouldn't it make sense that they'd have relationships with taxi companies to try and get better supply on occasions such as that?  If it's rainy, and a Friday night, there will be city-wide shortage - so, what's the contingency plan for your hotel patrons?; *  Gym.  Finding the gym was a work out.  In the basement and down a fairly long hall, and past grandma's house did I go.  Not central to the room areas;  and *  Lighting in large meeting space.  Much of the conference was in a large meeting room in the West Tower.  The lighting in there was not so great, and difficult to see the people speaking from the raised platform/stage.  Needs better spotlighting.

So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own.  Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other.  Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street.  But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc.  Beds were comfy and I love the pillows.  The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well.  Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway.  If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city.  Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms.  This is the BEST.  All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc.  Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line.  You can walk to the Pier and to the Magnificent Mile.  Nothing wrong with that.

Our event took place at this hotel so how convenient is it that we got to actually stay here? :) I absolutely LOVE the location of this hotel because it's right smack dab near all the best restaurants and touristy spots in Chicago. And since we didn't have a rental car, my coworker and I got just a tiny bit of downtime to enjoy a nice stroll downtown and have my very first deep dish Chicago style pizza for lunch! And we had this event in May so Chicago...wasn't really the ""Windy City"" that it normally is. It was like summertime. My room here was amaze-balls! I had a huge comfy King-sized bed all to myself and I remember the pillows being marshmallow heavenly snuggle bunnies. The bathroom and the room itself was very modern contemporary, just the way I like it. The BEST thing about the room was the actual view that I had. Such a gorgeous view of the city and the water! I also liked the bar they have here. It was a pretty happenin' spot. I actually enjoyed a few strong drinks here with coworkers at the time (mind you, I don't think I turned 21 yet then...sssh!). They had this HUGE fishbowl of a margarita that came out and after sipping down more than 1/2 of that, I was quite impressed with the rest of my stay. ;) I also like the promptness of the customer service here. Especially when ordering room service. They brought up some late night snacks for me so quickly since I was straight buzzin after that margarita. LOVE me some room service baby.

We arrived early on Saturday morning since we were attending the Cubs game.  We knew the rooms wouldn't be available, but checked in and left our luggage at the bell desk.  We received a call an hour or so later informing us the rooms were ready.  We stayed in the West Tower and had a beautiful room with a great view of Lake Michigan. The hotel is always crowded, but it's always been quick and friendly service.  The bar is great with good drinks and food. We were checking out on Sunday morning, but wanted to take advantage of the beautiful day and bum around the city.  We were told we could leave the car in valet parking until 6:00 which was great - most places will typically charge for another day if you keep the car past the check out time.  The bell desk was very accommodating and even suggested we head down to the lower level and the parking attendants would bring the car around so we could preload and then park it until we were ready to leave so we could avoid the lines picking up our bags later.

Seriously!  If you like to feel like you are entering a posh hotel from the moment you drive up, this probably isn't the right hotel.  Otherwise, the room was updated and comfortably appointed, no complaints there at all.    We were placed close to the elevator, so I was concerned about noise.  We didn't hear a peep!  Impressive.  We LOVED this location - right on the river, JUST off Michigan Ave. (which I view as a positive, cutting down on street and pedestrian traffic outside of the hotel), it was perfectly positioned to walk the river, the magnificent mile, and Millenium Park.  Will return!!",4,2,1,0,N,-rNdN9Ea_Rts25Hl76i6RA,Colleen Q.,"Chicago, IL",February 2010,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0010277492291880781,ziIfrqtyupmeNlPAOx6jTw,Quartino,"Quartino - Near North Side - Chicago, IL",1454,4.0,"Restaurants, Tapas Bars, Italian, Pizza, METADATA","626 N State St Chicago, IL 60614 Neighborhood: Near North Side",Yes,$$,No,http://www.quartinochicago.com/,(312) 698-5000,0

One of the more centrally located hotels in Chicago that's still affordable (at least in the off-season). It's not right in the middle of everything, but it's just a couple blocks up from Michican Ave. right along the Chicago River. We had a partial view of the river from our room, which was pretty cool. The bathroom was probably my favorite part of this room. I really liked the backlit mirror for some reason. I know it was cold outside, but the water did take a very long time to heat up (both the sink and the shower). The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, though there was a small towel on the floor in front of the bathroom when we first arrived and one of the pieces of art on the wall looked like it had some grease/fingerprints on it. Not a big deal, but attention to detail could have been a bit better. The walls weren't particularly soundproof either - there was a baby that was screaming for a good hour or so in the room next door to us, and it was pretty audible. Luckily it wasn't until around 9am and we were already awake anyway. Although we did get a great price on the room, there's two primary reasons I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of four: $9.95 per day for internet, and $52.00 per day for parking. I know it's the middle of the city, but come on now. Also, the business center is only open until 5pm every day so you're basically forced to pay for the internet if you need to print something.

2009,8/7/2011,YzAO8I0uiUaxwi,"A very solid 4-star stay! Obviously, I have not stayed at too many hotels in Chicago. As a former resident, I never had much need. But on a recent trip, it became a necessity so I set out to find the best priced hotel room downtown. A hotwire search for ""4 stars and above"" near ""downtown"" landed me a $111/night rate at the Hyatt Regency. For Thursday-Sunday! $111/night!? Chicago in the summer!? I feared that this would be a dump due to the price, but was relieved somewhat when I saw their announcement on Yelp detailing their complete renovation of all 2,000+ rooms. Wow, big hotel. Yes, indeed. This is a ""convention"" hotel, with multiple towers, huge convention spaces below and all around. It's massive. As luck would have it, the SoniCare toothbrush convention was here during my stay, so there were a lot of out-of-towners with brilliant smiles bounding around everywhere. Could be worse, right!? When you enter the lobby it actually looks more like an airport or a huge mall. Nonetheless, my check-in was quite smooth and I was on my way up to my room on the 23rd floor. What i found was quite impressive! A small room (1 Queen bed), but very modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV. Very updated and you can definitely tell the remodel went full force. Things felt crisp and clean, the carpet fresh. It was just a really nice room. And on the 23rd floor...though I didn't have a river view (could've upgraded for $20, but wasn't spending a whole lot of time there!) was looking out over office buildings and Chicagoans bustling around to work and play. Suggestion, if you're here on a weekend and there is a big convention (usually), just ask to be put on those floors. Typically people from Sonicare are not going to be rowdy and loud. 18 years olds on vacation, another story. My room was quiet and peaceful at all times.   The service during my stay was also right on key. Never had an issue. I'd never eat or drink at the lounges/Stetson's with all the wonderful options nearby and in Chicago, but they had a nice snack/bev area for quick snacks. It's not cheap or anything, but it does in a pinch. Parking: You can valet (which is probably a lot) or you can park in one of the underground lots and walk a few blocks to save about half. I think we paid around $20/night. Much better and you don't have to wait in a crazy valet line in the morning! Any complaints? Just one small one. The elevators get super jammed up around the 10-11am hour, and I waited 20 minutes for one to get downtstairs on Saturday morning because all the Sonicare ladies were going somewhere at the same time. Like all 4,000 of them. So, that didn't work so hot, but everything else considered...this was indeed a ""4 star hotel, downtown"" and for $111/night! *Also, free wi-fi. I'd stay again.

The hotel has been remodeled and are still planning to remodel other parts of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to check in. We asked if we could have a city view and were granted it with no extra charge. Our room felt modern and updated. The bathroom was really cool and I loved the lighting. I'm a nurse so I know all the nasty germs lurking around hotels. I am really creeped out when I see other people's hair in the shower or around the toilet. I never once saw someone else's hair! The cleaning staff is great. They cleaned our room, made the bed, replaced our towels and straighted up each day! Nothing ever went missing from our room either. Plus, at alot of hotels the cleaning staff is loud and will barge in even if you have a privacy sign on the door. Nope, not here at the Hyatt. We never heard them cleaning other rooms and they never disturbed us when we had the sign on the door. Kudos! As for location...it was perfect for us! We took the train alot to other parts of the city like out to White Sox Stadium, China town and other parts of the city. Just a few blocks away, you can catch the Red line for $2.25 a ride. Thats much cheaper than a cab! Michigan ave is right up the block too. If you are needing snacks/drinks for your stay there is a grocery store 1 block away. Go out of the side door by the computers and the bistro. Go out those doors, take a left after you walk down the stairs and the store is right down the way.

The location right on the Riverwalk is great, and it's an easy walk to many of the downtown area restaurants and shopping. It is about a mile to the Navy Pier on foot, which is a lovely walk if the weather is cooperating. The hotel itself is insanely huge with a labyrinth of conference rooms, spanning two buildings and a network of stairs and underground tunnels. The outside is kind of ugly, and looks like an industrial building out of the late 70s/early 80s, but at least the rooms themselves were really nicely decorated and comfortable. The bathrooms, too, were generously sized with great lighting. The extras were also good quality--yes, I am very picky about the soaps and shampoos that are in the room. Not only that, but they also supplied a travel sized toothpaste. A nice touch for travelers who may have forgotten one of the essentials.

Not knowing what to expect, we rolled in around 8:00 AM the day of our checkin, not expecting to be able to check in yet. The front desk clerk was very friendly and offered us a Queen room available then, or we could wait for a King room and they would call us when our room was ready. We decided to wait for a King and went downstairs for breakfast. Also, I have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they were able to keep it behind the front desk (I assume in a staff fridge) with no issues. Yay! This allowed us to be a little more free in our plans. Bonus, our room ready right as we were finishing breakfast! We also signed up for the ""Gold Passport"" which gave us free internet access and a late checkout (Tiphani at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly in letting us know about these perks!). Even when a snafu with the rental car company was going to make us even later than the already late checkout, they accommodated us with no hassle. The beds were heavenly, the complimentary toiletries were awesome (and that's saying something! They smelled fantastic!), and our view was exceptional (clear view of the fireworks from the Navy Pier, Room 1523). The ONLY drawback (and I really had to think about it) was that the L was a bit of a walk from the hotel, which made traveling to and from the airport somewhat of a challenge if one has a lot of bags.

It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.   Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel.  It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else.  The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night.  We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else.  Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in.  There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day.  I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity.  The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier.  The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late.  Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with ""Brandon.""  and yes, we heard all that!

I really can't complain. The staff were all exceptionally sweet and wonderful, the check-in process was painless, and we didn't have any issues. The young woman checking us in even made sure to give us a room as far from the elevators as she could, since those rooms tend to be a little loud. I liked that it had immediate access to the Pedway (though there's not a whole lot down there unless you know exactly where you're going), and was really close to both Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Great location! We signed up for the Gold Pass (or whatever it's called) and got our internet for our entire stay free. It showed up on the bill - we were warned it likely would, as they had just switched over their internet system - and it was just taken off before we checked out.

2024,9/19/2011,CebQ-W6Ob2J5F043-XkkCw,"While the renovation at this place looks great (you can see they poured all their money into the lobby/restaurant area), there were more than a few issues with the room. First off, the view, was excellent, from the 32nd floor, peering thru the Chicago skyline and looking down at the Chicago River. The beds were also comfortable but that's where the good stuff ends. First, parking. The only on-site parking is via valet ($35 each time you park) or $50 all night valet. You can park at a nearby parking garage for around $25-$30, but for a major chain in a major city, I expected some on-site parking that didn't involve ridiculous parking fees. Next, the amenities. The reception on the TV is terrible. Some of the channels barely came in. The water pressure on the shower was weak (weaker than the usual hotel water pressure). The air conditioner/fan would still circulate air into the room even though the panel had the thing turned off. After two nights, this resulted in a very dry/sore throat. Finally, the concierge. Hit or miss with these folks. A couple of them were friendly, polite and knew what they were talking about. Then  there were those who just didn't belong behind that desk. From the guy who gave us the wrong directions back to Midway (if we followed his directions we would have ended up in Indiana) and the lady who told us parking across the street was ony $23/night (it was actually $30) and the guy who sarcastically joked that the fitness area didn't have ""cool stuff"" like a jacuzzi or sauna to a whole list of other tidbits that I've since pushed out of my mind, the conceirge service at this hotel is questionable. Also, I'm not sure if they're still there, but there's a bunch of strikers/picketters outside the hotel and from a brief conversation with fellow guests who were staying on the 16th floor, they could hear them banging their pots and blowing their horns at night.

However, since that'd be quite a short review, allow me to elaborate: i found this hotel on Hotwire for the low low price of $70 a night. I have a feeling it would have been a lot more had I not booked it before there was a playoffs game scheduled the same weekend. It was worth this price, I guess, but I still wasn't pumped about my stay. First off, the hotel is really not all that convenient for public transport. We had to hoof it to Clark and Lake to catch most all of the trains. In the Spring/Summer/Fall that would be OK, but in Winter it just meant we took a lot of cabs. Suddenly the $70 room got a lot more expensive. Second, our room was TINY! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear every frickin conversation in the room next door. And they were boring conversations. The bathroom is right off the bed, and is only separated by a sliding glass door. Sometimes when two people are sharing a room they don't want the other person to hear your bathroom noises. This was impossible in our room. I tried to turn on the sink to disguise them, but the water pressure is so low that wasn't much of a help. Still, the room was clean and had a fantastic view.

When we tried to check our bags so we could explore the city, the bell men argued that there was no room? WHAT!? This place is huge Jesus open a closet and throw it in there! Whats worse is that we could see the room's interior which was only half full!!

2030,1/28/2011,RqryoLA5yJHxbKDZD-UTbg,"Location, location, location. It was my family's first time in Chicago and we were only going to be there for a few days. Since everything seemed to be located downtown we decided to stay at the Hyatt. What a great decision. EVERYTHING was within walking distance. Millennium Park was two blocks south, you're practically on the Magnificent Mile, about one mile SW was the Willis Tower (and a mile really isn't that far of a walk people), and lastly, you're only a block or two from the lakefront and river boat tours. The concierges were great. We arrived fairly late, around 1ish in the am, and they were very accommodating and friendly. She even asked if I wanted a room with a waterfront view with no extra charge, but  unfortunately the rooms with direct view were all booked. She still gave me the best she could find and we were still able to see the river as we laid in our bed. My airline lost my son's carseat and lent me one for temporary use till ours was found. The concierges took care of switch when my son's carseat arrived with out a problem. My only complaint would be their parking. It cost $50 per night for their valet service (no private lot). I went online before our trip and found that parking at the Millennium Park's garage was drastically cheaper; $20 a night, so expect to pay a little or a few blocks walk if you have a vehicle.

2032,8/15/2009,3tPhRUq9xAWsH,"* This place was outdated 10 years ago - and hasn't been updated since! * I gave in and did something I usually don't do.  I stayed at the main conference hotel for a conference.  What was I thinking?  I usually like getting away from the crowds and having a little space to take a break.  But I remember last time I went to a conference in Chicago I hated walking around in the heat.  So I gave in and stayed at the Hyatt.   While it was good to avoid the heat, the hotel itself is outdated and has fairly pathetic ""service.""   I got upgraded to the Regency Club level (ok, that was a good plus) which is supposed to be a slightly better room, better amenities, and access to a club that serves breakfast, snacks, evening apps, late night desserts, etc.   I got to my room and found the electronic safe didn't work. (One of the buttons was broken.)  I also found that the desk chair had a broken arm.  I called the ""exceptional service"" button that is supposed to take care of any guest needs.  After waiting for about 7 minutes on hold (ugh) the woman said, ""Oh, safes are security's issue.  I'll connect you.""  So before I could tell her about the broken chair I was on hold with security.  I finally got through and told them the safe had a single broken button, but it was the important one that locks the safe!  He said he would send someone up right away.   While I was waiting I figured I'd call ""exceptional service"" and get the chair fixed too.  After another 8 minutes on hold I got the agent and she said they would have someone come up and fix it.   Nobody showed up for either issue.  I had to eventually leave, and when I got back later that night the safe was still not fixed, and neither was the chair.  There was no message and no note.  They ignored the issues.  I called again and went through the same run-around.  After 5 days at the hotel they never fixed the safe or the chair!  Sheesh! On the bright side, the Regency Club did have a nice view of the river and the lake (as did my room).  The breakfast wasn't terrible in the club (they actually had a pretty good quality lox).  I wish the bagels were fresher to match up to the lox though.  But I digress.   I did appreciate they had ample bottles of water to drag around in the heat, as well as some nice fresh fruit (the plums and peaches were particularly good).   Overall I'm not sure I will ever stay in a conference hotel again!  I will go back to my old conference strategy of finding a nice hotel nearby and enjoying the stay a bit more, while having a place to get away to as well during the craziness of the conference!",2,5,3,1,N,QW3VXvKxEiGZgo1vasV5xw,Justin the geek  thats cool K.,"Burlingame, CA",December 2007,1,227,0,50,12,18,3,0,0,0.12853907134767836,hQiNNzF794PeDbH_miu6hA,Vindu Indian Cuisine,"Vindu Indian Cuisine - North Dallas - Dallas, TX",38,4.0,"Restaurants, Indian, METADATA","4701 Frankford Rd Ste 237 Dallas, TX 75287 Neighborhood: North Dallas",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.vindudallas.com,(972) 931-5999,0
2033,12/1/2007,H722eNyoqjNPsqV-MP191g,"I forgot to review the hotel we stayed at recently (October 2007) during our trip to Chicago for a conference. I remembered to review our horrible dining experience at one of the restaurants here (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) -- but neglected to review our stay in one of the rooms. We stayed for a few nights - check in was fine. The lady was training someone, but everything was fast and efficient. The only negative was that we reserved a king size bed, but the only room left with one was one equipped for wheelchairs. She asked if that would be OK, and in my haste, I said sure. I shouldn't have. The room was horrible. The negatives piled up. First of all, the shower. That was the worst aspect of the room. The showerhead was ""removable"", attached to a bar where it could slide up and down - to adjust height I suppose. The problem here is that it would slide down on it's own... so if I wanted to clean my lower half and not my upper half it would have been great. Or if I was three feet tall. So I was constantly readjusting the shower. Not to mention the shower never felt that clean (paint peeling and water damage... and a few bugs). Oh, and it was like a tub with no sides. Secondly, there was no counter in the bathroom - so there was nowhere to put any of your stuff. At all. I actually took a luggage rack, placed towels over the straps, and put my bathroom bag on it. Ridiculous.   Another annoying factor was the door - it was configured so when you opened it, it stayed open... for way too long. It would have been fine if there was an optional button to operate the door (for a wheelchair), but it was sort of power operated so no matter what it stayed open for at least 10 or 15 seconds after you enter. So the entire floor can essentially see in your room for that long. So you kind of stand there awkwardly and wait for the door to close before proceeding. The positive for the room was the bed. It was wonderful. One of the only hotel room beds where I wake up not aching. OK, perhaps the only one I can remember where I didn't wake up aching. So that's a big plus. I guess the location was too, but it was awfully far away from the convention center.  Lobby was meh and the food options not great (especially if you want to eat healthy), room service or anything like renting a movie was grossly expensive (even for a hotel).

Based on the outcome of the following story, I would choose the Hyatt as my place to stay every time I come into Chicago from now on. I was working as a volunteer at an event on the Navy Pier, sponsored by the NPO I work for. Naturally, as a ""volunteer employee"", my hotel and travel accommodations were supposed to be taken care of once I followed the proper procedures for filling out paperwork and obtaining confirmation numbers. The flight was fine, the trip from O'Hare (mostly) uneventful. But imagine my shock and surprise, when my partner and I arrived at the hotel and we were informed that THE ROOMS WEREN'T PAID FOR. NOW was the time that the event coordinator chose to tell me that we were expected to pay for the rooms in advance OURSELVES, to be reimbursed at a later date. ""Mortified"" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, especially since I didn't have a credit card that would cover the entire expense of the stay. At that moment, I was pretty much ready to haul it out of there and find the nearest Motel 6, Econolodge or Days Inn. But it was thanks to the quick and diplomatic thinking of Jennifer, the front desk rep, that the situation was made easier. She advised me and the event coordinator about what to do (obviously, this was not the first time she'd had to deal with a problem like this.) Plus, in the meantime, she made sure we still got a room at least for the night, (with a SPECTACULAR 27th floor view of ""The Loop"".) I won't bore you with the other details, but the situation was eventually resolved and we all lived (and slept and dined) happily ever after. Not only is the atrium of the Hyatt dazzling to behold (with probably the world's most interesting designer fountains), but the quality of the customer service didn't stop with Jennifer.

We had actually stayed here in the past for NYE and enjoyed it so we figured this would be a good experience, boy were we wrong! First of all, this place is huge, there are two different wings and it can become frustrating if you hop on the wrong elevator to get to your room (you'll end up on the opposite side of the hotel).

We got to the room and everything was fine until I noticed we didnt have any cups/ glasses. So we called for them and they didnt come, we called back and they sent them up (30 minutes later). We went out that night, came back into the hotel and literally as SOON as we got off the hotel a male security guard began following behind us. I became alarmed because I did not see any Hyatt branding on his clothing but he was holding a walkie talkie....anyway he began to ask us if we were guests at the hotel and we told him yes.

The toilette is situated in such a manner that to flush it one must reach in an awkward manner. When the toilette seat is up, it rests agains the tissue paper. Odd. I turned the air down when I arrived and then went out for a few hours. When I got back it was still warm. Called down (difficult to do, see below) and Juan arrived, saying he wished the hotel would give us a disclaimer. Their air system is not the type that blows air into the room, and it's silent. So no white noise. But he said they'd bring me a fan right away. To call the operator, one dials zero as expected, but then one gets a stupid robot giving options; speak the name of the employee or department you wish to reach, or press zero for the operator. I already pressed zero! Odd. After an hour I had not received my fan. I pressed the one touch button on the phone for exceptional stay. I was put on hold for over five minutes and then was disconnected. I dialed again and was spoken to after a minute. She had not heard that I requested a fan. It's been almost another 30 minutes. I want to go to bed, but I want a fan. The ice machine is about 3 rooms down from mine, yet I can hear everyone getting ice. Annoying. The pluses; great location, whether one wants to go to Navy Pier, Grant Park and the museums or the Magnivicent Mile, you are right there. The rooms are nice enough and the view is great.

The hotel itself was pretty decent, the rooms were fine, nothing amazing, but fine. My first complaint was that the entire time we were there we consistently were hearing this banging noise, almost like someone was hammering on something. We made a comment about it to the front desk and they told us it would stop and they gave us a $15 coupon for food/drinks. The noise continued throughout the entire week. A second complaint was the TV. No, we were not in Chicago to watch TV, but whenever we did it was terrible. We had about 5 different news channels, 1 channel that showed a 24 hr. infomercial on prosthetic hands, and Russia Today. Really? My third complaint was the lack of wifi. Our first day there we called downstairs and found out that wifi was $13 per 24 hours. Eek!! The entire time we were in Chicago we made daily visits to the Corner Bakery for internet.

2060,2/15/2010,gTZHpBc8ztzomENW2XQ0kQ,"I recently attended the College Art Association 98th annual conference (CAA2010) at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.  As just a hotel, this place is great.  The hotel is huge and it is conveniently located near basically everything downtown.  But, when it's filled with conference attendees, it makes navigating the lobby, getting through the revolving door, or trying to get a taxi frustrating, particularly when you're in a hurry and everyone else is just milling about. At one point a big Saturday-night crowd got stuck in the revolving doors on their way to exit the building.  It took three doormen to unstick the door.  Now, clearly, this can be chalked up to the guests' stupidity, but it seems to me that these herky-jerky, stopping-starting revolving doors can be improved on. The ballroom---the location of the CAA2010 book fair---is in an absurd and rather inaccessible location.  From my room on the 26th floor, I took the elevator down to the first floor, then a set of escalators down two more flights, then walked across a big lobby, through a corridor cramped with academics conversing, across another lobby just teeming with people, and then down another set of escalators.  I was an exhibitor at the book fair and toting my credit card terminals, supplies, conference program and other documents, as well as my handbag, camera bag, and all of my winter gear, was hugely inconvenient.  Also, three floors down, there is no cell phone service.  I have a brand-new iPhone 3GS, and could make no calls, nor access 3G or wifi down there.  As a hotel that hosts, no doubt, countless conventions each year, I find this issue preposterous. As far as the room goes, it was quite nice.  Roomy, huge TV, lots of furniture, modern décor, great view, mini bar, excellent water pressure in the shower.  At one point I dropped my book on the floor and knelt down to pick it up, only to see a whole mess of dust bunnies on the floor at the head of the bed.  Also there was a Fat Tire bottle cap---not mine, I swear---in the corner of the bathroom floor, which was not picked up until my third day in the hotel.  My room was for the most part nice and quiet; I occasionally heard folks walking by my door through the hallway, but I couldn't hear through the walls like I so often have at other hotels.  The sheets were nice and I can't sleep in sheets with low thread counts, so that's saying a lot!  The bed and huge mass of pillows felt comfortable and luxurious. The staff were friendly and made me feel super-special for being a Gold Member, which I'm pretty sure just means I signed up for their rewards program. The elevator situation wasn't any more annoying or inconvenient than it usually is at a hotel filled with conventioneers all going up and all staying on different floors, but at one point the elevator I was on alone stopped on floor 19 while en route to 26 and would not budge.  Luckily, the door opened and I was exactly on the floor (not halfway in the elevator shaft like you see in action flicks), so I was able to disembark and catch another elevator up to 26. The gym was lovely.  Spacious, with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, as well as free weights, kettlebells, weight bars, resistance bands, and stability balls.  And those Stay-Fit-at-Hyatt gym towels are better than any I've ever seen.  I have to confess, I have a bit of a collection here at home for my own personal use.  The treadmills and ellipticals have display screens where you can run on a track or in the mountains, watch TV, or listen to your iPod.  The iPod attachment charges your device as you listen.  It's pretty rad. All told, I would stay here again.  I just hope that either the Hyatt increases its connectivity in the ballroom or else the next convention I attend in Chicago is held at the Sheraton across the river, where wifi and cell phone signals are a non-issue.",3,0,0,0,N,pEKyJG24V2x-9safHIadoA,Doug Lost Knight C.,"Irvine, CA",October 2008,29,92,2,122,72,77,53,0,0,0.06297056810403832,jfM7IFazq2MkkDzuop_ZbQ,Great Clips For Hair,"Great Clips For Hair - North Dallas - Dallas, TX",4,3.5,"Add, METADATA","4347 W Northwest Hwy Dallas, TX 75220 Neighborhood: North Dallas",None,None,None,None,(214) 654-0055,0

The rooms are immaculate, clean, and well maintained.  I never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds!  The WiFi is reasonably priced, but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance.   I am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably, my single downside with this Hyatt.

Our room was, according to the girl at the front desk, recently renovated. I believe it, it was pretty swank and modern inside and had a nice view looking out at the river. The Bathroom was a good size. The afforementioned front desk employee was very nice. It was pricey, which is understandable given the location, but that price not does not include wi-fi. Very dissappointing. It may seem like a trifling complaint, but in this day and age wi-fi is as basic as cable tv in hotels. Also, housekeeping comes by very early, which is no big deal unless you forget to throw the ""privacy"" sign on the doorknob the night before in your drunken stupor. The location is very central and convenient to the all the train lines, but is more shoppy and businessy than anything. Not a lot of exciting bars in the area, but cabs and trains are everywhere so it doesn't really matter.

2064,12/24/2010,qAqTm0JmLlcNe6tGaKSB3A,"Initial caveat:  we got a 4-night stay during the holidays for $75/night using priceline's name-your-own-price, so it's hard to complain, cause the place is really pretty swanky.  But, I strongly doubt that the maid service, concierge, and other service personnel knew we were there on the cheap, so it doesn't excuse their behavior. The place was undergoing major renovations, so the outside of the buildings and the (main) east tower was kind of a mess, which maybe explained why they may have been short staffed or disgruntled.  We stayed in the West tower and it was quiet and the rooms were nice and comfortable, with good views. The service was rotten though.  The maids never once replaced anything they removed from our room.  If I ever wanted fresh glasses, ice bucket bags, or shampoo/conditioner, I had to call the maid service and request them.  And when I called, I usually got attitude: ""Can I get turn-down service tonight while we're out this evening?"" ""OK, someone will be up shortly."" ""And would you ask the maids to possibly check and replace any used or empty items around our room while they're up here?"" (gruffly) ""Ok, sir, you're going to need to tell me EXACTLY what you need.  What do you ACTUALLY need?"" I listed the various items, which I found later in a plastic bag tossed in the bathroom sink.  They couldn't even place the items in the shower or their various places. The other big issue was room service, whose absurd prices (I assumed) already contemplated the strenuous task of delivering the food up an elevator,  Nevertheless, they charged a $4 delivery charge on top of auto-gratting the bill 18%.  Thus an already over-priced $13 turkey sandwich cost a mandatory $20.  Ridiculous. I like Hyatt and would probably try the other one near the Water Tower if we visit Chicago again, but this experience was a mess.  If we'd been paying the full $179/night, I would probably have lost it.",2,1,0,0,N,sXhGLvb7dIYBrzDh4s5UnA,Tina Spice Girl A.,"Cupertino, CA",April 2010,119,293,4,262,98,45,113,47,5,0.32056892778993434,4SO_hghEmiuO-UJPZhcYKQ,Taco Cabana,"Taco Cabana - North Dallas - Dallas, TX",9,3.0,"Restaurants, Mexican, METADATA","11824 Webb Chapel Rd Dallas, TX 75234 Neighborhood: North Dallas",Yes,$,None,None,(972) 620-0139,0
2065,7/13/2011,JPJTbgh159TjR5nrQDxPIg,"During our stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, we enjoyed being only a few blocks from Millenium Park, Macy's and the Art Institute. Our beautiful room (1064 in the East Tower) overlooked the Chicago River and the Magnificent Mile skyline. Automatic check-in was quick and easy. We arrived before the 3 p.m. check-in and were able to check our luggage easily. Before we settled in, my husband did his usual 10-minute bedbug search with high-beam flashlight and magnifying glass, and there is no problem here. My number one priority in hotels is getting a good night's sleep, and we slept beautifully. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the linens and pillows of high quality. The blackout curtains did their job, and there was no noise from the street or adjacent rooms (the hotel was full at least one of the nights we were there, so we did have neighbors). We visited in the summer, and the room and public areas were always delightfully cool. Transportation was excellent, with the Number 6 bus to Loop stores and Hyde Park stopping in front of the hotel, and the Number 151 Michigan Avenue bus on the corner. Valet parking was easy, and there was always a line of cabs at the hotel. The housekeeper was very nice and she kept the room spotless. The shower felt great! Hotel staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, with none of the ""have a nice day"" automatic civility of many businesses that cater to the public. After I tried and failed to get tickets for Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House tour, I turned to the concierge, and she walked me through booking the tour on the Robie House website and printing the tickets. Another concierge printed driving directions back home for us. Breakfast Buffet: The selection and presentation is terrific. It's like attending 12 bar mitzvahs!  Manuel made me a wonderful omelet, cooking the onions and mushrooms thoroughly, as I requested, before adding the spinach and cheddar cheese I had selected. The fruit cup and pineapple spears were very fresh. There are options to match any appetite and special diet, and for those without time to wait for an omelet, there were at least a dozen egg and pancake dishes on the steam table. Smoked salmon, excellent cheeses (including artisan cheddar, goat cheese and brie) and freshly made waffles were available, and there was an extensive selection of breads, pastries, cereal and drinks. Service was exceptional!  Manuel brought my omelet to the table, and the waiter brought me coffee, water and a newspaper. One of my restaurants pet peeves is constant sound. While there were televisions in the dining area, the sound is muted, leaving guests in blessed silence to enjoy this fabulous breakfast. The workout room was clean and well equipped, and you can hook up your iPod to the cardio machines. My husband and I enjoyed a drink at The Big Bar. The negatives: Constant noise from the bathroom fan, loud enough that we had to keep the bathroom door closed; a squeaky bathroom door; and intermittent motor-like noise from above the ceiling. I asked to have these problems fixed and they weren't. Also, the flat screen television did not have a very good picture, most shows were not high definition and there was no programming guide. At one point during our stay our key cards stopped working. Assistant Front Office Manager Rocco LaFronza was just delightful. He got us into our room and comped us breakfast buffet the next day, turning a negative experience into a positive.   I look forward to staying at this luxurious hotel again.",5,1,0,0,N,Soafvih5HKR7JaG2_u8zTg,Cherie E.,"New York, NY",August 2006,21,91,6,111,61,22,22,0,2,0.040390590324012425,OugtAZ9FTHFcqBvXLXDW8A,Doctor EyeCare,"Doctor EyeCare - Dallas, TX",9,5.0,"Health and Medical, Optometrists, Shopping, Eyewear & Opticians, METADATA","4414 Lemmon Ave Dallas, TX 75219",Yes,$$,None,http://www.doctoreyecare.com,(214) 522-3937,0

The lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. You take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area.     The hotel let me check in at 12pm (I had a 3pm check in time). I suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early.The women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""I have a room on the 18th floor with a view of the river or you can go higher with no view"". I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldn't get stuck with a room with a view of a wall.     The rooms are big (I had a doubles room) The beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. An Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries.     Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers.

The first time was last summer: I'd scored a room for my mom (she was visiting me for my b-day) for only $100 on hotwire during the first week of June. I was really looking forward to hanging out at the hotel with my mom and just absorbing the atmosphere there. Unfortunately for my mom, my dad was being an idiot that weekend, so she couldn't make it for the night. She told me I could have the room and then called them to let them know I'd be taking over the reservation. They were really nice about it and didn't give me any hassle. One of my friends was in town early to visit and so we both ended up taking the room (neener to my bf, who didn't get to come). My mom was really nice and let us order a glass of wine (each) close to midnight (which would begin my 23rd birthday). I took it as a good sign when our total came out to $23 and some change. We had a wonderful time dancing around our room celebrating my birthday. The room was really nice and we both enjoyed the iHome they provide. Did I mention the view of the river was fantastic? A wonderful start to my 23rd year of life. My second experience was last fall when my best friend chose the Hyatt to spend her bachelorette party night at. Upon my arrival I was hassled by a rude member of the concierge because I couldn't remember the bride's room number and they wouldn't give it to me because I ""wasn't on the list"" of the room guests. Not really a big deal-I know they're not supposed to give out room numbers anymore. So I stood there for a few minutes while I waited for a response text from the matron of honor. I got it, announced to her the room number and a ""thanks for nothing!"" (rude, I know, but so was she), and I was up the elevator, lickety-split. The room was the same as the one I'd shared with my friend for my b-day back in the summer-double bed with an iHome. I got there early and in order to commemorate the  occasion (bachelorette party), they actually sent us (free of charge) a bottle of champagne, 4 chocolate covered strawberries, and some chocolate covered biscuits. Score! It was so nice of them. We had a nice night there. Hung out in the cool bar after getting back from the festivities, walked around the hotel, and finally went to bed around 3am.

I was kind of worried because I had heard about people getting really crappy rooms off Priceline but was quite happy with the room that I received. It was quite clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was of a good size also. Unfort I did not get a room of a view of the lake but that was ok as the room over all was nice. This is a HUGE hotel that many conventions use to host the events and the guests. It is a bit impersonal compared to the boutique hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago and else where but what it really boils down to is: are the rooms and hotel well maintained and clean and do I feel safe. The answer is yes to both of these and I'd have no complaints if I were to get another room off Priceline or through the hotels website.,3,0,0,0,N,PdpWp_j67Nfr_oQF-4yKUw,Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",March 2006,211,627,97,1244,651,508,199,6,26,0.26059850374064836,1Sh__IZ8pbpZwyEgiLW7pw,Choza Mama,"Choza Mama - Pasadena - Pasadena, CA",198,3.0,"Restaurants, Latin American, Peruvian, METADATA","96 E Colorado Blvd Pasadena, CA 91105 Neighborhood: Pasadena",Yes,$$,No,http://www.chozamama.com,(626) 432-4692,0
2101,10/21/2007,3bxSnzgEm6tNGxq0ENjHJg,"The Regency Hyatt...is one of my 4 favorite hotels in the city (others being Sofitel, Swissotel, and W). Basically, it offers the most luxurious rooms you will ever experience anywhere, and saying you get much more than you pay for is an understatement. Thick, soft pillow top beds, Oreck air purifiers with ionizer and fragrance inserts, ipod docking station, 5-disc cd changer, large-screen tv, fresh tulips, white callas, or some other exotic variety of long-stem flower in a crystal vase in your room daily, solid cherrywood furniture, brass desk lamps, memory foam pillows with extra pillows and blanket in the closet, 600 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets and comforter that feel like silk against the skin, and the bathrooms...aaaaahh...no expense spared on anything! The layout of the rooms represents a perfect melding of design, aesthetics, and  function.   I have ABSOLUTELY no complaints or disappointments, and that says a lot because I am one picky bastard. Expect rooms to run about $180-237 per night. Also, when you're confirming your reservation, ask for a complementary upgrade to a king on the Regency Club level floor (this is the limited access uppermost penthouse floor). If you're lucky, one will be available at no extra charge and you will be privy to one of the best views of Chicago. This is one of the few hotels that will make you feel guilty upon check-out and as you settle your bill...knowing you would have gladly paid $200-300 more a night for the kind of luxury you enjoyed during your stay.   I can go on and on about the Hyatt, but  I will stop here because the 4-star+ ratings already speak to how amazing your stay will be. RECOMMENDATION: YES...DO the Hyatt Regency EVERY CHANCE YOU GET! Special occasions, for a weekend of downtown partying, whatever excuse you can think up to get you there! Get a king room on one of the upper floors (if you can, do the Regency Club level...there is no better view of the city). Try their website's special promotions when you're booking first, but if you're only seeing $200+, then hit Priceline or Hotwire...they tend to have the best deals for all of the nicer Chicago-area hotels. I also suggest parking your car in the garage about a block away (can't think of the name of the street for sure...but just off Wacker and Columbus Dr..by the bridge). That garage is not affiliated with the Hyatt, but only charges $26 a day.  If you do Hyatt's parking/valet service, expect about $46 (after taxes) a day with in/out privilege. I know...OUCH! ...but hey...it's Chicago. Also: Lobby level floor...huge open restaurant, lower-lobby level...bar/lounge area where drinks are served in the evenings. You will also find the Hard Drive nightclub here, which is situated in the middle of a fountain/pool...so surrounded by water. Check out pics. DISCLAIMER: My experience is limited to the Regency Club penthouse level, however, I had many friends stay in regular king rooms and reported experiences similiar to my own.",5,0,0,0,N,P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,Zack the road warrior W.,"Los Angeles, CA",April 2010,4,174,29,107,16,48,1,1,1,0.19037199124726478,NMvQ_36WeZBOKgx2l5WSSw,Quikset Jewelry & Watch Repair,"Quikset Jewelry & Watch Repair - Dallas, TX",3,2.0,"Local Services, Watch Repair, METADATA","4848 Lemmon Ave Ste 108 Dallas, TX 75209",None,None,None,http://quiksetjewelry.com/default.…,(214) 368-4888,0
2102,11/12/2007,pyHPjmasF33b5CvL7vQkdQ,"I attended a conference in Chicago last year and the Hyatt was one of the conference hotels. Because of the Hyatt name, there was no decision to make; of course, I would stay at the Hyatt. When we arrived, check in was easy and the staff offered us the opportunity to upgrade our room to a Deluxe room. At only $15.00 more night, I thought the amenities definitely sounded worth it. When I initially entered my room, I was impressed by the design and concept. It had an Oriental feel to it and reminded me of some of the boutique type hotels I have stayed in the past. I noticed on the surface that the room was rather dirty. When I sat down at the desk, the leather placemat was very sticky. On the bathroom vanity, there were numerous soap type stains. I was able to easy rub them off with a damp washcloth. The walls were dirty, both in the bathroom and bedroom. Both the carpet and the bedspread on my bed had cigarette burns on them. This was rather surprising since I was in a non-smoking room. The carpet was more understandable, but I was surprised that a bedspread with two burns on it would be used. I also noticed that the ""plush bathrobes"" promised by the check-in staff was not in the room. I called to have a robe delivered and when I put it on the next morning, it had a big rip in the front of it. I had dinner out, came back to the room and put on my pajamas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not get the ""turn down service"" we were promised. It something I enjoy while traveling and makes me feel a bit pampered. I pulled back the bedspread and noticed much debris on the sheet. Initially, I tried to brush the sheet off, but on further inspection, I noticed there were at least five hairs on the sheets. It was really disgusting. I did contact housekeeping and the sheets were changed by a very nice woman named Sarah. She did have much difficulty finding sheets that were not torn. After 20 minutes, I told her I didn't care if they were torn; I just wanted them to be clean. She did replace the burnt bedspread and apologized that it was used. I also did not receive the daily newspaper. I did call and re-request the turndown service the next night; I received it on night #2, but not #3. I suppose overall I was very disappointed by the room that I received. I did call to complain several times (robe, turn down service, dirty sheets) but no one seemed too concerned about me. I don't know if I should have pursued it more while I was there, I felt like I was being too picky, but when I got home, my husband thought the room sounded terrible.",1,0,0,0,N,OtjARqgBuNAbMX1fa5B2Hg,Tara A.,"Nashville, TN",October 2010,42,11,1,8,2,0,0,0,1,0.015047879616963064,kqG9RmJqhqOLtYmkBriukA,J.

2103,2/14/2008,Dq9b7ePbuhDSToVSIr10Qw,"I actually travel a lot internationally for work so I've stayed in my fair share of hotels & can without a doubt say this is the WORST business floor accommodations I have ever stayed on.  I'm not even sure where to start... My reservations were for the Regency Club floor, two double beds because I was traveling with my dad.  My dad arrived prior to me & I had asked that they let him check in.  He was told there were no rooms with double beds & was moved to a suite with a king bed on the 21st floor & they would gladly give us a roll away bed for free.   When I got to the hotel I told them this wouldn't do I wasn't paying good money to sleep on a roll away bed or not be able to use the amenities of the Regency Club which I was paying for.  They were quick to move us to another room back on the Regency Club level.   I have stayed numerous times on the business floors at the Shangri-La in APAC so I guess I had my expectations set too high.  If anything the Hyatt should go take a class from the Shangri-la when they open in Chicago on how to run a business floor.  Anyway I expected a nice sized room with additional amenities, such as slippers, free internet access, & a nice selection of teas &/or coffee.  The only thing I can say nice about our room was the view.   Let's start in the entrance; there was a closet right when we entered the room however the lighting stunk so you couldn't really see anything in the closet & no slippers.   Next the bathroom, this has got to be the WORST hotel bathroom I have ever seen.  The toilet was like a public restroom & the bar to flush was up under the vanity. When you flushed it, it sounded like a 747 was coming through the wall.  The wall paper in the bathroom was coming off the wall & there were no extra amenities that I have gotten at other hotels on the business floor, such as nail clippers, razor, toothbrush etc.  I am paying good money to stay on this floor & didn't just upgrade when I checked in.  There was 1 bathrobe on the back of the door that I guess all of us are supposed to share.  The hairdryer was a piece of crap that if you used longer than 90 seconds on high it would overheat so to blow dry your hair you had to allow at least 30 minutes of going back & forth waiting for it to cool down.  Now lets continue on to the main bedroom.  The beds were nice & had nice down comforters on them the pillows were great & there were 4 on each bed with one in the closet.  The TV sucked the remote control would only work from one exact location in the room which of course wasn't where you were sitting in your bed.  I was floored to find out we didn't have free internet access in our rooms like many other hotels offer business floor guests.  (I did pay extra for this room right????) We stayed 4 nights at the hotel & only received turn down service two of the 4 nights.  Some days we would only get 1 coffee refill for our coffee pot & other days we would get two.  Some days we would get 1 new washcloth some days we would get three.  It was like playing a game of craps.  The only thing that seemed consistent was the morning paper.   Now let's move on to the Regency Club which offers free continental breakfast, snacks throughout the day, cocktail hour & desert hour.  Breakfast was ok the set up of the room is just terrible they toss a bucket of ice in the bar sink & toss in some yogurts & the milk & juice.  There is 1 trash can in the entire room & you get to drink your coffee from a paper cup.  I thought they would at least have a hot pot or two with oatmeal & some other hot items like MOST business floors do.  Nope... you get your choice of pastries, fresh fruit & little individual boxed cereals.  Not my idea of a great continental breakfast.  I've actually had better at a Holiday Inn.   Cocktail hour this was my favorite... at most hotel when you stay on the business floor they have complimentary cocktails & appetizers for a few hours every evening.  While the appetizers were great the beverage service stunk.  It was a serve yourself honor system $6.50 for a beer & $5.00 for some wine & oh yeah pour it yourself.  Don't have cash then please fill out a card with your room number & we will just charge your room.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I'm still at this point trying to figure out what the hell we paid extra to stay on this floor.  At this point I've vowed to stay at the Shangri-la next time I'm in Chicago (opens 2009).  Desert hour was ok it's from 8:30-9:30 & was different every night.  Cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies, clairs. I guess all I can say is if you have never stayed on a nice business floor at a really nice hotel then you will be fine staying on the Regency Club Level.  If you have stayed in some really nice hotels with really nice amenities then you are bound to be disappointed with your experience at the Hyatt.  I would highly recommend not upgrading to the Regency Club it's definitely NOT WORTH the extra money.",3,0,0,0,N,QQnPbpNzopsqAY0h8TRRpw,Charles CJ J.,"Oswego, IL",July 2008,179,137,21,185,66,61,73,83,4,0.08821635544108178,5vhTKxS8s9FpTrWChoVkZA,T/X Restaurant & Bar,"T/X Restaurant & Bar - Downtown - Dallas, TX",53,4.0,"Restaurants, American (New), METADATA","Luxe Stoneleigh Hotel & Spa 2927 Maple Ave Dallas, TX 75201 Neighborhood: Downtown",Yes,$$$,Free,http://luxestoneleigh.com,(214) 871-7111,0

2115,1/12/2009,w3G8B2S7-AUxKCLIwxHbNQ,"Oh, Hyatt Regency Chicago. How your Lost and Found department has tainted my review so. I attended the NYE 2009 bash at the hotel and let me tell you, it was a bash and a half. I went with a bunch of friends and we ended up getting three rooms total and all of the rooms were incredibly nice, big flat screens, ipod docks, granite counters in the bathroom, great views, etc. The party allegedly had 2000 people attending but the Hyatt was definitely ready for everyone, checking in was a breeze, and they gave us our three rooms all on the same floor, which was a total perk. The party was a blast - the top level was the band and it had lots of light, and the second level was much more dark, clubby, and had a DJ. I would HIGHLY recommend if you attend the shindig next year to get to the party as early as you can because finding seats to eat was a struggle. Partially because we had a large group but that was pretty much the only negative for the party. You occasionally had to wait a long time for a drink but almost every bartender handed them out two at a time and they were all strong. The party was a huge success, the hotel was beautiful, and everyone had a great time. HOWEVER - upon checking out the next day and heading back to the burbs, I realized that I had left something in the room. Right around the same time, my friend called and told me she had left something in her room too. OK partially our faults because hey, check and make sure you have all your stuff. So I called and talked to the Lost and Found department and they told me they'd look for it and get back to me. They didn't get back to me. I called the next day. They said they still hadn't found it but that doesn't mean that it had not shown up. My friend stopped by the next day. They didn't have either thing. I have called about every other day for almost two weeks now and neither of our items have shown up. Their voice mail message says they will call you back in 24 hours and I've probably left four messages and gotten one call back. I just think it's insane that they have a designated lost and found department ... employees whose ENTIRE job is recovering guest's lost items... and they haven't found either item OR gotten back to us about our lost stuff. So that really negatively affects my overall Hyatt experience, sadly. I understand that NYE was really busy and a lot of people probably left stuff but I have called multiple times and they are well aware of me and what I am looking for.... how could they have not found either thing, almost two weeks later?

The rooms are on the small side, ugly interiors, and no apparent thought to the arrangement of furniture, TV, etc. The elevators are excruciatingly slow.

Location was key for the both of us as it would be our first domestic vacation where we relied solely on public transit.  With that said, the PH was just around the corner from the Red line and one block away from the Blue line which can take you to O'Hare...saving you lots of money on cab fare! Stepping into the hotel was a little was odd as it was a cold, stale looking interior until we took the escalator up to the lobby where a ceiling mural of luxurious art greeted us; eat your heart out Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The lobby alone was rich in history and grandeur.  Check in was quick and friendly. There was just one elevator bank with eight cars, unless you were staying in the Executive floor and you had your own exclusive elevators to use.  Our room was located on the 8th floor, where the fitness center was located as well.  The room was of decent size and the decor although fairly newer, was kept in style of the hotel.  The bathroom was very small, but functional.  It could've used some ventilation system as it would get quite steamy during a hot shower so, we had to always prop the door open.  The room had a walk in closet and safe big enough to hold a laptop. However, our room did have a connecting door to each room on both sides of us.  One night, we could hear deafening cries from an infant in the room next to us.  I wanted to complain but I felt sorry for the parent who had to deal with it.  Then on the Friday night, we could hear music radiating  from the Ballroom (not sure how many floors below us) for a wedding or something.  But all things considered, noise wise, I would consider ourselves majorly lucky as we were placed in a room facing other rooms (Imagine a ""U"" shape, we were on one side of the ""U""), otherwise we would be hearing cars and the above ground train on Wabash. A couple other pros I should mention was the HSIA was complimentary, which is pretty rare for full service hotels, not to mention, the signal strength was excellent. The other pro was having a Starbucks on the ground floor.

2140,5/28/2012,RxP7MH5HEevk,"Attn: Mr. Todd Temperly What happened to the GOOD OLD DAYS?  When Hospitality meant something... When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com",1,1,0,2,N,JKKRQL2CLAS_e5snigaYTw,Tom N.,"Indianapolis, IN",November 2008,1,15,3,20,4,2,0,0,1,0.01048951048951049,KnXKeWwNfFAKOjVRJ2AaXQ,Masami,"Masami - Richardson, TX",53,4.0,"Restaurants, Japanese, METADATA","501 W Belt Line Rd Richardson, TX 75080",Yes,$$,Free,http://www.masamirestaurant.com,(972) 783-6800,0

2142,7/14/2012,bQRv,"I wanted to enjoy this hotel so much, because I love classic architecture and the location of the hotel is amazing. You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening.

The very cool and detached attitude by the staff left me nervous that my older/international guests would have problems with the impersonal service or that the end of my stay would be marred by a billing problem . We booked 5 rooms for myself and my wedding party and our guests booked another 6-7 rooms. When we booked and paid for the 5 rooms, I asked if any of the rooms had  a mini-fridge (for my cake) and the front desk agent looked past me and said, ""no that's an extra $40/night""  After spending $2500, I felt a little put out.  Later, I was checking a room quote for a friend and noticed that the rate for an executive level room was just $15 more a night. I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option. The final resolution was a free upgrade for myself and the assurance that the concierge was available to handle any needs I had.   I needed to change the names on a couple rooms and each time I called the Front Desk, I was on hold for 20 minutes.  Each conversation started witht he agent telling me they couldn't change it because I booked it elsewhere, then I would insist that I confirmed and PAID at the Palmer directly, more time on hold, and then changing the name. Finally, I emailed a list of guests to the concierge a couple days before the event, in case people got lost or had a problem with their reservation. It was met with radio silence.

At check-in, I was lucky enough to be helped by an arrogant, entitled gentleman who didn't find it worthy of his time to share with me how I could find my room, where the pool was or even how to access the elevators. I couldn't even get the jerk to smile.  I didn't think much of it until I was checking out (more on that later) and heard another staff member graciously and cheerfully speak to patrons. Now, I have a lot of respect for housekeeping staff. They undoubtedly work very hard... but what I did not appreciate was 1) how late the rooms would be cleaned. I got back to my room at 4pm once and it was still in the state that I left it in 2) when I would leave my room in the mornings, how my housekeeper would ask me if I wanted my room cleaned. When I answered yes, she had to make sure I was certain of my decision and would then be disappointed. What the hell?! I get that it would be nice to have one less room to clean, but isn't that your job? 3) noisy and inconsiderate staff. Because the walls are paper thin at this hotel, I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room.... including the HUGE fuss the staff made about the room next door... at 7:30AM!!!!!!! Apparently, when my neighbors checked out of their room, they left behind quite a bit of broken glass and furniture. The staff cleaning up IN the room thought it appropriate to YELL OUT to other team members down the hall to come see the wreckage. I could distinctly hear the chatter, the furniture being moved around and even the noise coming from their walkie-talkies.... all at such an ungodly hour. Unforgivable. Plumbing was a nightmare. Not only was the flow from the shower head poor, but, if a housekeeper was cleaning next door and turned on the water there, my water pressure got even lower!!!! Did I mention that the bathroom is tiny?! Don't rock back and forth as you brush your teeth - you might just fall into the toilet! So here's my biggest gripe....an hour before check-out, I review my invoice and there's clearly an erroneous charge. I never dined in the hotel's restaurant. I try reaching the front desk SIX TIMES and no answer. I ask concierge to connect me and still no answer. Finally, 15 minutes later, I try again and get a live person on the phone. I explain that I never dined at the restaurant. No problem, he says, he'll remove the charge. Says I need to come down to pick up a new invoice.  I gather my belongings, head downstairs. A new staff member prints out my invoice and the charge is still there. I contest it and make reference to my call earlier. This dude says that there's nothing that can be done. In fact, because I didn't get the name of the person who said he'd waive it, I'm stuck. The charge needs to be ""investigated"". So hold on... I just spent over $900 staying at your hotel and you're gonna squabble with me for $17?!  Of course, I asked to speak to the manager. So Ms. Rasha comes out and says I should go home. If the charge isn't legit, she'll credit my account. I tell her that's not going to fly with me. This is my company card and each charge needs to be substantiated. I know I didn't dine at the restaurant in the hotel. IN FACT, I wasn't even at the hotel at 9:30pm last night. So she tells me, that 9:30pm must have been when the charge posted, I must have eaten there earlier and just simply forgot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? I tell her no, I haven't dined at their restaurant PERIOD. She offers to go through last night's receipts and get this, if the name on the receipt matches mine, I have to pay for the dinner. Why would I try to get out of a $17 charge if I had actually authorized it?!  She says to come back after 30 minutes. I go back after 45 minutes, and a new staff member tells me she's still looking through receipts. Fine. I go make myself useful and come back 25 minutes later.  The new staff member goes into Rasha's office, comes out, and prints me a new invoice without the charge. No explanation. No apology. Nothing.  I asked her what happened and she says ""The manager removed the charge. It was posted to the wrong room.""   Does the manager not know anything about customer service? Does she not have the human decency to come out and tell me this in person after she had me wait over an hour?  I ask her to call out Rasha and the latter comes out with an indignant look on her face.

My wife booked our room on http://priceline.com. That was probably our first mistake. We ended up getting a room that was fit for a stowaway on the Titanic. Our section of the hotel must have been undergoing renovations, because it was dark, dingy and not well maintained. Our room was small with a beautiful view of the fire escape and alley.

Look at this location!  Look at this building!  I want to die every time I go into the lobby it is so beautiful.   Ahh, but this is how they suck you in!  And how it just masks the greatly unfortunate experience from then on. Twice I had someone new at Registration.  And both times, instead of finding out the correct information, they tell me something completely different and wrong and completely waste my time. (1st time was in trying to get approval for me to check in without husband present, whose name was on the reservation.  2nd time I asked about a mailbox, because my letter was too large to fit in the mail chute on my floor. But to be fair, when I went to someone who knew what they were doing about my check in issues, it was fixed immediately.) So check in is at 3, right?  Exhausted,  I get to the room, throw down the bags, and call room service for a pot of coffee. Room service is ""closed"" until four. But the helpful pre-recorded message assures me that the restaurant downstairs, Lockwood, would definitely be able to help me!  I call Lockwood.  The chick on the phone says ""yep, come on down and get your coffee here"".  Oh, OK thanks, but I can just go to Starbucks for that?  Why would you have any service unavailable at the same time you have people checking in?   And speaking of the room.  I was ""upgraded"" because of the mix up at check in. My upgrade was to a small room that would have been beautifully decorated in 1990, complete with a large armoire that held a tube TV.  My view was of a fire escape (and most likely the alley below but I was too high up to see that far down.) Quite a bit different than the rooms they promote on the website.   I decide to check out the fitness center.  This is on a lower level, but when the elevator doors opened you would think you were in a completely different hotel.  Beautiful, modern decor in chocolate, greens and peacock blue.  The fitness center looks like a spa from the outside.  There is a woman at a desk who asks you to sign in.  Just as my pen hovered over the paper she adds ""Oh and by the way there is a $10 charge per day to use the facilities"".  Wait...what?  Are you serious?  Gah!  No thanks.   I just feel like my entire stay was non-stop irritation.  Are hotels the new airlines where the idea of service is dead and you are nickel and dimed to death?  I guess so, at least in the Palmer House.  Such a very serious let down.",2,6,2,1,N,IkNvWklg0_BV-rc2vDRyBg,Tara TBKENN K.,"Oak Park, IL",April 2010,3,15,1,9,2,2,0,0,0,0.016411378555798686,JMhe4XoAWm1IveSFrgHVvQ,Yelp's Secret Carnevale,"Yelp's Secret Carnevale - Upper Greenville - Dallas, TX",44,5.0,"Local Flavor, METADATA","5321 E Mockingbird Ln Dallas, TX 75206 Neighborhood: Upper Greenville",None,None,None,http://communityblog.yelp.com/2010…,None,0

They assured me this was done even after I asked them how they would do it since they didn't ask for her name. They take the name but I am skeptical. I land in Chicago and sure enough, my wife has been wandering around in 30* weather like a hobo in California clothing. They apologize but that's about it. (2) The guy at the desk was a smart ass. He asks for my ID, I give it to him. He then asks if I go by an alias, I tell him I use my nickname (DJ R***) often (my name is D*** R*** Jr). He finally says, OK, why are you using a different name? I'm a nice guy and will accept it, but most hotels will not. Really? I've been traveling frequently for the better part of 10 years and have never had a problem.

I NEED to start my days with a shaken green tea/lemonade. This property is close to a lot of Chicago's most awesome attractions. We did the architecture tour which was just a short cab ride away, went to the Hancock Building, did some shopping on the Miracle Mile, hung out at some cool places in the Viagra Triangle, walked to Millennium and Grant Park. Right outside is a train line. And across the street is a Walgreen's, next door is a pub, plenty of restaurants around (including two in the hotel itself) and a 7-11 just on the corner. We will definitely be staying at the Palmer House on our trip to Chicago next year. Friendly staff, BEAUTIFUL hotel, great location.

Monroe street, named after one of the most iconic women in the world, her beauty bedazzled and created a vision. A vision many like to recreate, renew in her honour. The same can be said by the centre piece- A golden statue of Romeo and Juliet. This hotel was made in the name of love. Sure the ending was no fairytale, but what real life story is? Its the journey that counts...I dont think any couple could put that across better. This is what the Palmer is about, falling in love and leaving. The lobby was sensational, something a Leonardo Di Vinci would be proud of. In fact I don't think I'd be surprised if someone said he heard this place was being constructed so he came to life to leave his final masterpiece. A bold statement I make, true as hell I mean it. It wont disappoint you. A historical fact about this outstanding and prestigious hotel, Its the birthplace of elevators. That's right, the man that constructed this hotel had a dream.

2171,9/29/2011,UT7tzqaxEhQG2Y8fHqisZg,"The only thing I liked about this hotel was the lobby. I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review. But I probably won't be staying at the Palmer House Again. There are many much nicer hotels in Chicago that offer fantastic customer service.

When I got to the hotel they couldn't find my extra day, which was cool because they eventually found it. I was told it would be corrected in the system and put as one reservations rather than two.. Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the ""check-out situation""... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room.

The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed. I stayed in a single room -- which is to say it had one double bed -- and it probably wasn't much bigger than your bedroom at home. Depends on your home, of course. And it's hard to judge, since in addition to the bed, there was a desk with a chair, a no-longer-in-service minibar, a side table, and an armoire with a TV. More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago.

When you're used to providing exemplary service, you kind of expect it when you stay in a hotel right? I don't mean to be a snob but this is one industry where customer service is everything. You're leaving your home to sleep and eat somewhere else. You should feel like you're staying in a second home. My family and I took a family vacation to Chicago to bury my Grandma's ashes and do some sightseeing while we were there. My Mom booked this hotel from Priceline so I was skerred all the way there. I'd never seen the PH so I was skeptical at best. They were doing some work on the front of the hotel and it was a mess but they were very careful not to inconvenience the guests which was much appreciated. Nothing is worse than fearing for your life by entering a door. (It came out beautiful by the way). When we arrived, we were given a key to my Mom & sisters room and another key to mine and my brother's room. My room was SO small and on a different floor than my Mom's room so I asked if they could move us. Good thing! We got a room that was twice as big and had a better view. You could have put another 4 beds in that room and it wasn't considered a suite. Sweet for us! The lobby is amazing and gives you that feeling of old-world Chicago. It was like getting in a time machine but not in a bad way. Everything was well maintained and all the employees made us feel like they were honored we were there. We even got a nice note from the front desk worker a few hours after we checked in. The hotel bar is a little pricey and stuffy so we opted for the dive bar next door with all the pictures on the wall. Help me out with the name here people, I loved that place. It was literally next door from the entrance that faces the El. I was worried about the location of this place but we managed to walk everywhere we needed to go. It was really nice having Corner Bakery on the corner too, they have great breakfasts. Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel because we were usually in a hurry to go on an adventure. I guess the only reason why I can't give them 5*s is because I'm still and always be a hotel snob. You're going to have to ramp it up to mimic the Four Seasons or Ritz for me to max it out.

2183,8/16/2008,0AobeQFCa8CpDL3tIaFwzA,"Busy, busy, busy.  I think I counted seven large events going on at the Palmer House during the two nights we were there.  Think a medley of professional salsa dancers, junior high cheer squads, and large wedding parties.  I found that most of this activity was contained on the first few floors and didn't really translate to much traffic in our hallway. I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door.

It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go.

2185,8/17/2010,v6Gd7ElX69ezxlGA8,"The front desk staff saved this review from dropping to a one star.   So for this latest trip we arrived later in the evening, and the first notable occurrence was the doorman yelling at the cab driver for not opening the trunk fast enough.  Then when he did get it open one of my camera bags fell flat on to the ground, directly on to my laptop. Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down.

2186,7/14/2006,JKknzjO2zv3wa,"I Pricelined a hotel in the loop and ended up with the Palmer House for a last minute trip to Chicago on June 2 - June 6. Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room.

We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn. There you'll find large, bright trees, a beer garden, and dozens of stalls peddling all sorts of Austrian, German, and Bavarian goods, gifts, and foods. I bring everyone I show around Chicago to the Palmer House, and it never disappoints. There's always oooohing, ahhhing, and wows.

I do know a few things though. Enter the Palmer House Hilton: location is decent. If I were a guest staying downtown and wanted to experience the city, I probably wouldn't choose this location unless you want to be closer to Millenium Park. Walking into the hotel, it's gorgeous. It's massive size reminds me of hotels in Vegas that go on for miles. In fact, I believe that the lobby with all of the bars, etc. also reminds me of a Vegas hotel (without the casino of course). I wanted to get there early to have a cocktail prior to leaving for my party, but ended up falling behind. Never EVER wait until after 5 to check into the hotel on NYE. The line was nuts. Lucky guests waited in line while others in their party got them drinks from the bar. I knew I should have brought another person with me. Oh well. On the website, I was notified if you are staying on the Executive Level, there is a quick credit card check-in option to avoid long lines. This was not the case when I got there and the lady at the front desk never heard of that. Interesting. Perhaps something for them to look into during crowded periods? Though, for my long wait, the front desk lady gave me late check out at 2pm for free. I chose executive level because 1) it sounded cool 2) I figured it would be quieter with more business people (or just less children). Little did I know it also comes with breakfast and appetizers from 5-7 on a special floor. Fun stuff. The room was NICE. It was large and came with a couch, tv, desk, nice bed, and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy. Or it felt that way after my NYE partying. And it's not squeaky and has plenty of pillows. I just hope they wash their sheets. Vending machines. All I wanted in the morning was a bottled water, but did not have enough 1s. So I thought since it was $2.50, I could buy two and use a $5. Well, I found out it only takes 1s. Not cool. I don't like to use the glasses in the rooms due to shows about how they are never washed. I was forced to use one. :( I didn't end up using my late checkout since I got about 3 hours of sleep (it was New Years!) . I checked out on my phone to avoid lines and grabbed some ""breakfast"" in the lounge upstairs right before it closed. It was pretty much picked through, but I got a sesame bagel and chive and onion cream cheese. Definitely needed something in my stomach. All in all, I really enjoyed staying on the Executive Level. I did feel cool. We had separate elevators where you have to insert your key to get in. And the elevator was right by the front desk. I'm not sure where the other elevators were located, but that was pretty convenient.

Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while.  As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine.  Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in.  When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions.  We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party   So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom.  Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect.  We needed a place to sleep and get dressed.  We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options.  The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.   We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning.  The food was good, but it was way overpriced.  Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy.  Overall we had a great experience.  The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.",4,1,0,1,N,KwrgDez9in6VI9VH8eF47g,Sue B.,"San Mateo, CA",January 2009,0,4,2,9,1,1,0,0,0,0.0029218407596785976,NDWxZuCFsM6isNjTw1stnA,Cliff's Grill,"Cliff's Grill - Medical Center - Houston, TX",22,4.0,"Restaurants, Burgers, METADATA","6605 Main St Houston, TX 77030 Neighborhoods: Medical Center, West University",Yes,$,Free,http://www.cliffsmedcenter.com,(713) 383-0900,0

I was absolutely taken away with the grandeur of the hotel lobby.  The Palmer House Hilton is a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. It's in a fantastic location -- there are lots of great restaurants in the area; it's within walking distance to many of the city's top must-sees; and there's very easy access to the subway (the Red Line is right outside of the hotel). I arrived in the morning around 10am, which is way early for check-in.  I was planning to store my bags until the afternoon when the rooms would be ready. However, the woman at the front desk was able to find one room ready at that time (the other wasn't ready yet), which was fine by me! How wonderful! It was nice to freshen up and change before heading out to explore the city. The room was ginormous! My friend had told me the last she stayed there her room was tiny were small, so needless to say, I was thrilled when I walked in.  There was enough space to waltz if you wanted to!  Good bath products, excellent water pressure (that is so important to me).  The beds were super comfy.  For someone who doesn't normally sleep well to begin with - much less in a hotel - my head sank into the pillows and I fell asleep right away each night. Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby.  F&B service in the lobby wasn't great.  We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening.  There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables.

She called weeks in advance and was assured that there were no problems with her request. But what happened? She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend. He walked in a bit more, and then finally left. The manager said ""Oh, I would've escorted him out anyway"" or something, but I think they could've been a bit more proactive.

The place is beautiful, that is for sure; a throwback to a time when fine hotels were majestic and grand and not modern and boutique: fresco ceilings in the lobby, gold trim, open bar and huge lobby.   The problem is twofold: it is aging and it is expensive for what you get.  The rooms have a old feel to them, but they are still quite old and small.  You don't get much room for your money and with so many great luxury hotels downtown, it is tough to make this the go-to choice.   Plus, the ample conference facilities means that the lobby is all jammed up with people from whomever the hotel is hosting that day.

2219,7/20/2011,HlR4dKOBP9VxQWH4RHRF8Q,"At first  glance, the Palmer exudes luxury. It has a gorgeous lobby (as is depicted in the photos on the website and the reviews here), and an art deco charm when you first walk in. It is clearly a hub of events from weddings to meetings with the corporate meeting rooms and the 1000+ rooms to accommodate everyone. However, in the realm of hotels I have experienced as a pleasure and business traveler, I have to admit Palmer House gets an ""eh"" when it comes to the room. My room was a double (to be shared with my sister and mom) while we were attending my cousin's wedding this past weekend. The room itself was spacious and had 2 full (but super super small with no ventilation) bathrooms which were awesome and a blessing in disguise when you have 3 women getting ready in the mornings. But that's pretty much it. The TV was super old school, and sits on one of those old hutches  that are awkward to get around and was about 24 inches max. No coffee maker or mini fridge, thereby forcing you to go to their restaurant  for coffee or waters (although there is an in house Starbucks on the lowest level which is only open until about 8 I think). The restaurant and bar also close super early so we were forced to look elsewhere at 12 am on a Saturday night for late night food and drinks. It is not a hotel I would return to to relax in tranquility as I could hear my neighbors above and next door talk loudly at ALL hours. I give it 1 star for the area in which is sits--super close to State street which has shopping which came in handy on a sweltering 90 degree day, as well as being close to Millennium Park and some good food. A couple of train lines and taxis abound. 3 stars for the AMAZING security team who helped my mom get around by bringing the wheelchair in a timely fashion multiple times a day when requested. Seriously, I don't know how I would have done it without them! Its a big hotel and really hard to get around if you are disabled and need help. Minus 1 star for the quality of the room overall and the lack of some amenities I would expect from a metropolitan hotel. I think if you are looking for a place to crash in while enjoying everything the city of Chicago has to offer, the Palmer will suffice.

The ambiance is one of elegance and the presentation was amazing. I was very excited to complete the check-in process and make my way to my room. I knew that there was something strange upon check in - the representative said something about me being in a suite and how that was too large for one person. He then proceeded to downgrade my reservation to a standard room despite my assertion that I did not want to make that change. Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small. Although the hotel had recently been renovated, the impression I got was that not much thought had been put into the design/layout of these rooms. The bathroom was terribly small. The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel.

What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms.

2250,10/4/2010,1BD,"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.",4,1,0,0,N,ikYTvRnHF1SafTBvTd5DtA,Christopher S.,"Naperville, IL",May 2012,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0196078431372549,Idb6AfjSPHuIT34WY8SVsw,Weir's Furniture Village,"Weir's Furniture Village - Uptown - Dallas, TX",16,4.0,"Shopping, Home & Garden, Furniture Stores, Mattresses, METADATA","3219 Knox St Ste A Dallas, TX 75205 Neighborhood: Uptown",Yes,$$,None,http://www.weirsfurniture.com,(214) 528-0321,0

I had a King room that I booked on Priceline. You don't get to select the type of room on priceline like you do on expedia, orbiz, or any other travel site, so I had to call to make sure I had a King room.  I was also told by a friend to ask for the more renevated room, which I was able to get, (I guess).  The room was very very small. the bed was about 6 or 7 feet from the door. The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again).  The bathroom was ok, small but ok.     I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings.     I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning.

Now the rooms have been painted and fixed up. The furniture is more modern. However, the rooms are on the small side. Also the hotel is shaped like a U so some of the rooms are shrouded in darkness.

I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence.

2274,12/15/2008,zDV3MoLQsAADTluWPGzzPQ,"Stayed here for five nights on a recent business trip. Overall, I was pleased with my experience, mainly because I paid $70/night through priceline. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and I felt like I was not treated any differently just because I had booked through priceline. I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities.

They said the room was at capacity. How can that even happen? If you were responsible enough to only sell enough tickets that the main room wouldnt be at capacity then I wouldnt have spent $ 140 to be standing in a hallway by myself on new years stone cold sober. They wouldnt allow alcohol in the hotel rooms and if they found any reminants they would charge a $ 60 corkage fee. So greedy! Now back to the staff and maintenance.

I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have.  It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties.  The TV was extremely dated.  No wifi!!!!!!

(Pardon my French) First, when we checked in the folks at the front desk seemed to have some 'tude. This was a significant change from last time I stayed here when the service was impeccable. Even when I asked them for toothpaste and some safety pins, it seemed like a huge chore. Apparently when you ask for safety ""pins"" that also equates to just one. As far as service goes, there were a few redeeming factors, like the 'tender at the lobby bar, who was very fun, nice and energetic. Second, the decor is still chic and eco-friendly, but you can tell it's taken a hit over the years. Maybe it was just the room we were assigned (an ""01"" room right next to the damn elevator) but it was falling apart. It was way smaller than my room was the first time (read: a glorified closet), a huge chunk of decorative tile have been broken off the sink and another random part had fallen off and just placed on the counter. Really? You can't fix that before you place someone in probably your least desirable room in the entire hotel? The bedside lamps looked like they'd been knocked over at least 17 times. You could tell whoever cleaned the room prior to our check-in did a half-assed job. We even got a call from some friends who were also staying there who mentioned someone had taken a #2 in their toilet and they found it when they checked-in. Wow... The saving grace here amongst the elevator dinging and loud chatter all.day.long. was whoever cleaned our room for the rest of our stay. He or she fixed the pieces-parts in our bathroom and really made the place shine. I actually wanted to call the front desk just to give the house keeper praise. And, I realize I'm in Chicago, but $44 per day for parking is out of control. I'm pretty sure they're able to keep this hotel running based on that revenue alone. I now know better than to drive to CHI anymore.

Got this place through priceline and paid a cheap amount, like 75 bucks or something. Good deal. It only costs a little less than 30 bucks to get here in a taxi from Midway so that was a good deal too. The hotel itself is really nice. Boutique hotels are funny in general to me. They are usually old buildings that have be renovated. This follows that path. Being that it is an old building, everything is small. Also with boutique hotels, they always try to be trendy and minimalist. I like more grand and luxurious hotels but that's my opinion and doesn't count against this place. I like that it is also LEED certified to be a green hotel. I'm all for saving the planet and stuff. The lobby was very nice, although small. Bellhops were friendly and helpful. Desk people were helpful and friendly as well. The room was very nicely appointed. Traffic outside could be heard even on the 9th floor but it wasn't horrible. And its a downtown hotel so again, this doesn't count against the hotel. The room was fairly small but again, that follows boutique hotels' style. The bed was comfy and the wall hung TV was cool. All my really problems with this place took place in the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and very spacious, almost as big as the room, but had major flaws. First, the sink was too trendy and didn't serve its purpose. The faucet was WAY to close to the bottom of the sink. To the point where you couldn't wash your hands without hitting your hands on the bottom of the sink or the faucet itself. pointless. Second, the shower curtain was too small for the shower. It only stretched 1/2 to 2/3 of the way at most. This made showering difficult as to not get the bathroom floor wet. I don't know why this was like this but it bothered me. I posted pictures of both these problems, check the photos. The hotel restaurant looked pretty cool and had a big bar. I didn't get a chance to go check it out in detail but it sure did look like a good time.",3,1,0,0,N,hAyh4xsLi5h3bo-__pWUeA,dsky K.,"Seattle, WA",April 2009,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.003127443315089914,wGl_DyNxSv8KUtYgiuLhmA,Bi-Rite Creamery,"Bi-Rite Creamery - Mission - San Francisco, CA",5013,4.5,"Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, METADATA","3692 18th St (between Dolores St & Oakwood St) San Francisco, CA 94110 Neighborhood: Mission",Yes,$,No,http://biritecreamery.com,(415) 626-5600,0

Word to the wise, when you book via the hotel engines (Hotwire, Expedia, etc) you are typically filling up the most...err...undesirable rooms. Not always, but sometimes. You might end up in a great hotel, but be forewarned that you might get the ""blah"" rooms no one else wants. In this case. Most definitely. If you get assigned an ""01"" room at the Hotel Felix, try to get reassigned. it is DIRECTLY in the elevator bank basically. My boyfriend checked the floorplan and most definitely they carved an entire elevator out of this room, leaving it roughly at about 100SF, if that. It is TINY. Not just small, but terribly uncomfortable for any length of time. Impossible for two people. Claustrophobic. No closet space. Other than that this hotel is fine... Pros: *above average hotel restaurant: Elate. (and decent room service!) *great location, non-busy street. (Huron) in River North. *easy metered parking exists, 2 hour limits. *Staff is quite nice. *Free wi-fi Cons: *Room size *The coffee is always empty in the morning in the  lobby *$42 valet All in all fine, but was not totally comfortable in that size room with an elevator dinging ALLLLLL day/night.",3,12,5,3,N,HroOuYzslPu4iYUyUizolA,Naomi Naomi R.,"Waban, MA",June 2008,0,17,6,4,0,2,0,0,0,0.010739102969046115,2-QZwBBjubdwM52VaK5QvA,Old World Inn,"Old World Inn - Napa, CA",76,4.0,"Hotels & Travel, Bed & Breakfast, METADATA","1301 Jefferson St Napa, CA 94559",None,None,Free,http://www.oldworldinn.com,(707) 257-0112,0

The lobby area is beautiful and a great place to enjoy a glass of wine or cup of coffee.

The hotel exterior (an older, renovated building) stands out with its huge (but not garish) sign.  The inside of the hotel is small--from the elevators to the lobby to the rooms.  I thought my room, which was on the top floor was actually not too small (maybe bigger than what some of the other reviewers had) and provided a decent view of some of the nearby big buildings. The room was very modern with modern but still comfortable furniture and kind of a minimalist approach.  The room was very clean and the bed was nice and comfortable (good linens too).  The bathroom was also nice though the sink was very shallow (you are likely to touch the sink basin as you wash your hands).  The shampoo and soap were provided by a local company (H2O, which you will also see on some United flights). The room featured your standard stuff like TV, room service, iron, ironing board, and ice bucket; complimentary internet access was also provided. In terms of amenities, there was a spa as well as a decent (though small) 24-hour fitness center. Service was good.  The front desk was pleasant and polite.  The bellhops were really good--friendly and very helpful. Room rates are high here though it is about what you would expect to pay for a nice boutique hotel with a good location (though the rooms here might be smaller than other boutique hotels).  You can get deals here though.  I think they did a Yelp discount here once and you can find pretty good room rates on the online sites like Expedia. Hotel Felix is a nice and modern hotel with a very good location.  It also meets my key needs of comfortable bed, comfortable room temperature, clean room, and a good shower.  While the rooms are not huge, the pros far outweigh that one negative and I would definitely consider returning here if I could find a competitive rate. For parking, I think it is pretty expensive--probably $35 or more.  Though to continue with their eco-friendly theme, Hotel Felix provides free parking to guests who drive hybrids.",4,13,12,11,N,N_WB5usUFVBYI_8g7nnh-g,Craig Razz R.,"Geneva, IL",April 2009,30,324,30,246,69,44,40,14,1,0.253322908522283,elOPOJKEos4GAVeNWQX5Qg,Alfieri Farms,"Alfieri Farms - Embarcadero - San Francisco, CA",25,5.0,"Food, Farmers Market, METADATA","1 Ferry Bldg San Francisco, CA 94105 Neighborhood: Embarcadero",Yes,$$,None,http://www.alfierifarms.com,(209) 599-7382,0

For a boutique hotel, the Felix meets my expectations of being very simple, clean, and small. I'd go so far to say this place reminds me of ""the poor man's W Hotel."" The standard rooms were uber-small (sub 200 sq ft) and the nice-looking amenities are of cheap quality. Seriously? It seemed like every time I turned in my smallish room, I would: (a) bump into something and (b) break off a plastic component to something... The sink, the desk light, my bed, etc. The gym and business center were also very small. The vastly superior thing about this place was that the service was great during my two day stay-- including a very friendly doorman.

2310,9/18/2010,nBLzK,"I actually believe that Hotel Felix is worthy of 4.5 stars but couldn't feel good about giving them 5 because my room was located near the elevator on my floor - I could hear nearly all of the noise out in the hallway. I am not sure of there is a sound barrier issue in other rooms because my coworker was in another room (on another floor) and didn't come across the same issue. It wasn't terrible because the floor happened to be fairly quiet but the ding of the elevator's arrival during higher traffic times of the day was an annoyance. Now that I have gotten my witch ways out of the way....I can start to tell you why I am so smitten with the Hotel Felix. Here's a breakdown: 1. Location is fantastic and within walking distance of many conveniences that include Whole Foods, restaurants, bars, and shopping. This is just a short cab-ride away from practically everything else. 2) Hotel Felix did a fantastic job sticking with their Eco-friendly mission. I appreciated the fact that they utilize Organic materials, renewable resources and even the hotel's plumbing is most impressively energy efficient. Being a stickler for the word ""Eco-friendly"", they passed the test when their high-quality toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soaps, and lotion) were all not tested on animals either! A++++ 3) Although, there is no denying that the rooms are not large in size, Hotel Felix did utilize the space extremely well. My room had a small window in the far right of the room without a good view but it still shed enough light into the space.The stylish platform bed with drawers below, closet nook, and desk all fit nicely. The decorator did an amazing job of making everything look clean, modern, and cozy without looking like an IKEA catalog.The bathroom was spacious and well thought out with a large walk-in shower, vessel sink, and cabinetry for all of my ""products' to be neatly nestled into. This could easily pass for a well manicured studio apartment in NYC without any complaints.... 4) The Westin's ""Heavenly Bed"" has some competition because this bed was so comfortable! I could have laid in it all day! I also loved the neutral color throw that was at the end of the bed. Perfect to cuddle with. 5)The staff were always incredibly friendly and efficient from the front desk to the valet. I had forgotten my toothpaste (bonehead move) and a staffer delivered to my room a large sample size and even offered up a toothbrush! 6)The restaurant on the 1st floor, Elate is fantastic! I loved my experience there so much that I am writing a separate review! I would definitely recommend Hotel Felix to anyone who is looking for a not so vanilla experience. This boutique hotel is the way to go if you need a place to stay in downtown Chicago.

2330,12/12/2010,pY6IejPqZP,"I've found the perfect downtown hotel- finally (32/single/professional). I frequently travel to Chicago for weekend getaways and am thrilled that Priceline (Name your own price- $79/night) ""matched"" me with Hotel Felix. New. Clean. Modern. Great staff. I look forward to booking rooms at the Hotel Felix directly in the future. Several things really stood out with my experience. First, the self-park across the street was only $24/night. Most self-parks downtown nearer Michigan avenue are more like $35/night (there is also valet parking if you wanna pay for it). Also, Whole Foods is 2 blocks down the street, Walgreens across the street, dry cleaner down the street, old school barber down the street, 3 blocks from the nearest red line stop and about 4 blocks from Zara on Michigan Avenue. Another big winner for me was the the free WiFi through the hotel. No password. Easy. I stay at a lot of SPG properties and they are more than happy to charge you $20 a day or more for WiFi. This day of age, getting internet is almost as important as having electricity and running water in your room. Check-in was seamless. The H2O bath and body products were also a nice surprise. No bath- which other reviewers comment on- but it's not something I ever use. Esthetically the hotel is a cross between the W Hotel City Center and the Chicago Four Points by Sheraton. Despite having SPG ""gold"" status and being an AmEx SPG card holder, the W still throws me in their shoe box sized rooms where you can barely turn around. One poster said that this was a ""poor man's W hotel,"" but I'm kinda over the snooty service at the W. Didn't try the restaurant/bar- but both looked cute/cozy. Only criticism would be that the bed was more of a ""European Queen""- but not as obnoxiously small as the ""queen"" sized bed the Palmer house throws people into. Being a solo traveler this was totes fine. But if it was 2 'big boned' people they might have had some concerns. Also- the sink faucet was way to close to the basin to be useful. Clearly, the design team at Kohler was not consulted. Other more lackluster reviews on this hotel sited the lack of a minibar in the rooms. But I have to wonder if this is a criteria for ""LEED"" certification. The door men were helpful/upbeat. The developers/management team at Hotel Felix are truly to be commended. It takes a lot for me to be impressed in the service industry today. 5 stars not because it's a 5 star hotel- but because I had come to accept such lack luster experiences in Chicago's myriad of '4-star"" chain hotels. Others question the merits of this being a ""4 Star hotel."" My response to that is that most downtown Chicago hotels meet the criteria for being a 4 star hotel (all the horrible convention hotels; Sheraton/Hyatt/Hilton) but also consistently well-reviewed hotels like the Sofitel. I would never book a '4 star' hotel and expect anything other than the minimum criteria to achieve that ranking.",5,0,0,0,N,hpCS4g352-ozy98wTcU4oQ,Jayne I have good penmanship P.,"Atlanta, GA",August 2008,0,3,2,4,2,0,1,0,0,0.0019710906701708277,tHhaHPD2iMPueLBMxuW7BQ,Dallas Arboretum,"Dallas Arboretum - Lakewood - Dallas, TX",116,4.5,"Arts & Entertainment, Botanical Gardens, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, METADATA","8525 Garland Rd Dallas, TX 75218 Neighborhood: Lakewood",Yes,None,None,http://www.dallasarboretum.org/,(214) 515-6500,0

2332,12/22/2010,XpnJisIuBC4elCJqwWPfAw,"I was so worried about my stay at the hotel after reading some of the reviews online, but maybe the hotel felix is aware of their inconsistent reputation and is working to change it. I booked through a third party online site for a very low price for a friday night stay. I was traveling with my aunt, so it wouldn't have been a big deal if the room only had one bed, but I called two days before our arrival to put in a request for two beds. The representative I spoke with was very kind and accommodating, and told me she could not promise that the room would have two beds, but that she would note it on my reservation. When we checked in, the host had already set us up in a room with two beds, and away from the elevators. The room was a perfect size for one night (maybe not so for a family). The beds are not queen-sized, but they are so comfortable. The room had a pleasant smell, was quiet (although there is some noise from the hall), and the H2O spa amenities are fantastic. The sink in the bathroom was odd, but was not too difficult to use. I really liked that there were makeup removing towlettes, q-tips, and cotton balls available, as well as a small hair dryer. The shower was big and had a rainfall showerhead. The lobby is really beautiful, and in the morning they serve metropolis coffee!

2333,3/12/2010,9499G7XoQNWD-wQO2Vto9w,"Like a number of other Yelpers, I stayed at Hotel Felix because I received a really good deal on Priceline. I would definitely not have a problem staying here again if I got another good deal (I ended up paying $60 a night pre-tax), but probably would not stay here if I had to pay full price. The first night a friend of mine stayed in the room with me, and although many yelpers have complained about the size of the rooms, I didn't think it was overly-small, even with two of us. The too-small bathroom, however, was a big problem for me, and it's the bathroom alone that took this from a 4-star to a 3-star review. I do get the eco-friendly thing and I understand that the sink is really shallow to save water, but, it was just a pain to use. Beyond that, my sink ended up clogging the night before I checked out, so it then became nearly impossible to use. Also, I didn't like that there was no real sink counter space. Beyond that, we did visit the hotel restaurant, Elate, and it was just ok--nothing to rave or rant about. The Good: - Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly the doormen, and check-in/check-out was seamless. - Although, as is typical with hotels in the area, valet is expensive ($45 p/night), there is a parking lot across the street that is a bit cheaper ($35) and a parking garage that is even cheaper ($23). - Hotel is in a good location; in walking distance of many restaurants, clubs, etc. and a short cab ride away from a lot of other high-profile downtown locals). - Free wi-fi. - The best assortment of tv channels I've ever seen in a hotel; and the tv was a well-placed flat-screen. - Way-comfortable beds. The Bad: - Supposedly there were no double-bed rooms available when I arrived, and the bed, while comfortable, was a little small for two people who aren't interested in getting ""romantic"". - While it wasn't a huge issue, we could hear noise outside of our rooms, e.g., the ice-machine and elevator. - Too-small bathroom with an impossible sink that ended up getting badly clogged. - There was only one mirror in the entire room, and it was in the bathroom (which makes it difficult for two women to get ready to go out on the town). - The nonexistent view.

This is definitely a historic place in Chicago that anyone visiting should see.The hotel is close to many great things in Chicago.

When we arrived, we were notified that they had awarded all the 2 Queen bedrooms to Hilton Honors members and all they had left was single King rooms. I was with a relative, and we decided we could bare sleeping together for one night. When we arrived in the room, it looked as though this was at one time a janitor's closet converted to a bedroom. The room was absolutely tiny. Our bed took up most of the room and there was very little space to walk around or place our bags. The mini-fridge didn't even open all the way because it hit the end of the bed. Plus, our mini-fridge wasn't even working.Sooo....unless you're a Hilton Honor's member, I would be leery of booking rooms here.

The trip started out with difficult to understand but effective check in clerks but went downhill from there. On the way to our room we were trapped in an elevator for 20 minutes. It took that long to open it even with a hotel employee in the elevator with us to call for help; if it had been just guests in there who knows how long it would have taken. Once we were freed there was no contact from guest services to reassure us or offer a discount on the stay, just hotel security demanding our names and room numbers as if we had done something wrong. We weren't spending that much time in the hotel, just sleeping overnight and cleaning up in the morning but even that wasn't great. The mattress and pillows were poor quality, somehow managing to be not supportive but too firm at the same time. The bathroom was cramped, the shower was cold, and the facilities all looked like they had been repaired shoddily more than once. The walls didn't seem to stop much noise; I was woken up more than once by someone in a nearby room urinating (awesome).

The  majority of the staff was extremely rude. While checking in, I had one of the hotel porters nearly run me over while muttering ""damn"" under his breath.The room was tiny but that was to be expected seeing as the hotel has been around since 1893. I had to request a room change because the room smelled of mold and mildew and it appeared someone had dropped an iron onto the floor and left it for too long because there was still an imprint of the iron on the carpet. Our second room smelled better, but there were chips on the bathroom door. There was no fitted sheet on our bed. Just a top sheet covering the mattress and then oddly, a top sheet atop the comforter. I'm not sure if the housekeeping staff is so lazy that they can't make a bed properly or what. I noticed that there were several functions going on while staying there and it made me wonder; why if they make money on renting out rooms/dining halls for conventions or weddings etc. that they can't manage simple renovations? They can afford an automated self check in/check out machine but can't replace carpet or repair a bathroom door?? The woman at Expedia and the hotels website led me to believe the hotel was nicer than it actually was.

Not because it's old....heck, I'm old myself. But because the website gives the wrong impression as to what this facility has to offer. The rooms are especially horrible with paint sloshed over every single piece of hardware and dreadfully beat- up  woodwork in need of sanding.  The first room with a view of nothing but bricks was so awful that I asked for an upgrade. And I was given one..... for an extra $300.The ceiling in the large closet of my ""suite"" (and I use the term loosely),  hit the floor and stayed there for the remainder  of the visit.When I threw back the bed covers, what to my eyes should appear but an ant.Since I've been known to drop my purse on a restaurant floor, it occurred to me that I had brought it in myself.Wrong!The ants, who came through a hole in the wall,  were also all over the living room carpet. When I complained  to the  night clerk, he  said I must have left the window open. Does the place have a chef?  No. Only a cook,  who turns out  truly mediocre food. My order for soy chicken was so salty that it was like chewing grit...and   the rice served with the dish was a small, rock-hard lump. I received freshly cook rice after I complained to the waitress.  The whole thing should have never happened.Housekeeping?Oh yeah. That consisted of taking a swipe at the bathroom, making up the beds and vacuuming.  Dirty cups and dishes were untouched and no replacements  were provided.  The dressers, tables and other furniture were never dusted.The workers striking for benefits?I couldn't bring myself to cross that picket line, so I had to walk an extra three blocks to get to my destination. Good reviews?They were written by the hotel owners.Bad reviews?Right on brothers and sisters. You have covered about everything else that I wanted to complain about.Is there nothing good?Of course. The concierge, the doorman  and the regular staff were just wonderful. Kind and helpful to a fault.If you still want to stay there, ask for  a room with a view of Grant Park.

Anytime we needed help with something or needed a taxi, they immediately helped us out. The rooms were beautiful and had a 1920's vibe to it which I really enjoyed. it does get pretty hot in the room after a while, but its not hard to open a window and shut it when you get cold. The hot water does take a few extra minutes to come on, but I didn't find that a problem. The ONLY thing I have to complain about is how thin the walls are. We had a neighbor come to our room 3 times complaining of how loud we were, but we weren't even talking...it was our tv! Other than that this hotel was a wonderful place to stay and I don't regret it at all! So don't listen to all of the other bad reviews of the place.

2431,12/28/2011,-F3W-kCQEa6UoBvjbfAgDg,"I stayed with a group at Congress Hotel in early December, and we loved it. We booked 2 rooms, each with 2 double beds on the 6th floor. The room rate was excellent. With tax, it came to about $130 per room, per night. Parking was not included, but for $28 (split among a few of us) the Congress will park your car in a secure lot overnight with the option to pick it up late afternoon the next day. Considering the Congress is smack in the middle of the South Loop, I'd say this was a pretty huge convenience. We could get brunch the next morning without having to worry about feeding a meter or moving our car.The inside of the hotel is a bit ""The Shining,"" but luckily a lot less creepy. It's very old. The hallways are long and off-white, but clean and warm. The rooms were very clean, with high ceilings and lots of outlets (small, old ones, but lots!). The bathroom was a decent size and yet again, very clean and well-stocked with towels and soaps.There was a nice-sized TV, a huge closet, a very large desk and multiple chairs. Our room overlooked the Auditorium Theater and a corner of Michigan Avenue. We stayed on a Friday night and the hotel was busy, lots of groups of twenty-somethings as guests. This was fine with us. Oddly enough, even though the hotel is old, the walls are not very thin, and we did not hear much noise from inside our rooms. We even took our time exploring each floor and the ballrooms, service stairways, and so on -- the hotel is full of awesome history. Make friends with the bellhop & security guard...you might get some scary stories outta those guys!The only thing that did *not* please me was the unfriendly desk associate upon check-in. She was helpful enough, and we got what we needed (checked in, room keys, a spare room key later, easy check-out via the TV in the room). However the Congress Hotel  charges you the minute you book the room, not when you check-out, like most other hotels I've experienced. Generally a hotel will keep your credit card on file during your stay and charge you upon check-out, in case of incidentals.When we arrived to check-in, I was told I'd need to provide a card on which they could ""hold"" another $100 for incidentals (even though they had already charged my card as a purchase and still had my info on file). When I explained that all I had was a debit card, and that the $100 would cause me to overdraw, the front desk worker told me, ""Any time you check into a hotel you have to give a security deposit. That's the way hotels work."" So I told her, ""Actually, every hotel I've ever checked into charges me upon check-out, and charges me later *IF* there are incidentals.""  Luckily a friend of mine presented a credit card and we were taken care of, but I don't appreciate being talked to like I've never used a hotel before.Aside from the 1 attitude problem, everyone at the Congress Hotel was very friendly and accommodating. The place is gorgeous. The bar is really cool. And the bellhop Carl was super fun to talk to about the history. I highly recommend the Congress for an inexpensive, clean, very convenient, historical & interesting stay.",4,0,0,0,Y,lqq3ru0auJNjgKsc_lPLfQ,Nandini Dina H.,"Chicago, IL",August 2009,23,29,4,25,10,8,21,0,2,0.025064822817631807,WzAYpZpu5PJXhfoVTOYkjQ,Teppo Yakitori & Sushi Bar,"Teppo Yakitori & Sushi Bar - Lower Greenville - Dallas, TX",154,4.0,"Restaurants, Japanese, Sushi Bars, METADATA","2014 Greenville Ave Dallas, TX 75206 Neighborhood: Lower Greenville",Yes,$$$,No,http://www.teppo.com/,(214) 826-8989,0

2436,3/6/2012,RCKNSWBpkOHEKRTV4Ub8Ow,"One of the worse experiences doesn't even begin to describe the experience we had. My sister Caryn, had her thirtieth birthday here. I thought wow, a bit extravagant...but really it's a HUGE birthday marker for her and she really deserves to be pampered. So I though, why not? They'll make sure she's taken care of...BOY WAS I WRONG, read her testimonial since I wasn't there with her bad experience...SO, MY bad experience she didn't mention. A week prior my sister asked me if I wanted to get a treatment and have a girls day for her birthday. Very EXCITED I said yes, and asked her to book me a facial. The night before (less than 12 hours notice) they contacted her and stated they were cancelling my appointment and gave no reason. Caryn doesn't like to complain and asked me if that was ok...I was disappointed but, didn't want to cause a problem and just let it go. Later that night we were supposed to have dinner at AJA, Dana hotel's restaurant. When we walked in the restaurant's hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we had a reservation with Caryn. We had to call Caryn for the hostess to acknowledge we had a reservation. The hostess told us that we HAD to wait for the rest of the party in the bar area WHICH IS NOT HEATED and it was the same temperature as the outside. My Father, who is elderly, could not sit in this cold room and we insisted to be seated. After having an argument with the manager they obliged. We sat down and the bus boy proceeded to pour water in our glasses and our laps. YES OUR LAPS. For some bizarre reason he poured the water into the glass spilling it and then proceeded to continue to pour outside the glass on the table and into our laps. And he did that to all 15 settings of the table.Caryn had not arrived and we didn't want to spoil her evening so politely mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized. We ordered our drinks and they gave us a canter (of sake) that leaked. SO half the sake went into the glass and half went onto the table. The waiter apologized and was super embarrassed. He was kind enough to give us extra napkins to clean up the mess the buss boy and the faulty canter created.We ordered our food...Which was a complete disaster and completely disorganized. One by one when our food eventually came out. SERIOUSLY EVENTUALLY, from the time we ordered the food to the first course to arrive at our table was an HOUR. By this time we were all RAVENOUS but, relieved at the sight of the first plate coming out. We were all staring at the first plate of food, like starving wolves just coming out of winter and finding a dead carcass, and thinking in relief, ""OH GREAT, my food won't be very far off behind."" YEAH, we were wrong. Not wanting to be rude the ONE person who got their food waited until someone else got their food...Which was 10 minutes later...I KID YOU NOT!  I have never had service like this. Literally only one person every 10 MINUTES got their food. The food was cold by the time the next plate came out. By this time we encouraged everyone just to eat when they got their food. The delivery of the food was to ridiculous we actually asked the staff to cancel the rest of the orders. 10 Minutes later the REST of the food arrived! Miraculously.It only took TWO HOURS TO GET EVERYONE ONE FED. I use the word FED loosely. This whole dinner was supposed to be $1000...for a $1000 dinner one would think they would have their stuff together and at the very lease feed the customers properly. After dinner here we had to have dinner again somewhere else. The portions were substandard, wasn't all that good, and the service lacked. Our waiter did what he could with what he had so, I can't say he was a bad waiter...Just everything else.After that pathetic dinner My family went upstairs to Caryn's room  when we arrived at the floor there was BOOMING music coming from all directions. I asked Caryn if she was taking us to the night club, she laughed and said ""No, Apparently this is the party floor."" The room was nice and spacious and the view was nice. The wait staff arrived to set up the room for her party (which is why I am surprised that they gave her such a hard time after we left)Overall, I am very disappointed in this whole experience and I am even more so upset that our family PLUNKED down all that money for a special occasion that was ruined by Dana Hotel.

Okay, meant to say just a few comments and this ended up being much more...I will admit that I was a little worried we were too ""casual"" of a couple to stay there. No need to worry. There was a diverse group of people that stayed there - business travelers, young people, ""my age"" range and thankfully older, people in jeans or shorts or dressed to the nines. We wanted a hotel w/o kids, and found it. I know how that sounds, I have older kids and this was our much deserved getaway so did not want to be surrounded by kids of any age!Location was excellent! It was within walking distance of restaurants, Magnificent Mile, etc. There is a small parking lot right next to the hotel but runs about $40 per night. It is valet parking and unlimited exits w/o extra charges. Very nice hotel, though we didn't get a chance to visit the spa, bar, club or restaurant. Some other reviewers complained about noise from the club, but we didn't hear anything and we were on the 22nd floor. Loved our room! We had the Cozy King, we booked too late to get the Corner King. It didn't matter, the windows are floor to ceiling and it was wonderful, not disappointing. Great views as well. Big fan of the B&W Zeppelin iPod dock! Great addition to the room. Glad to see the hardwood floors in the room (there was carpet as well), perfect for those who are a little eek-ish about walking barefoot in a hotel room. Also loved the bathroom and shower. There is no door on the shower so water does seem to spray everywhere. Not really a gripe, but as we were checking out the fridge and beverages, someone before us had already opened the Voss water and cleverly concealed that it had been opened. We left a note every day we left the room, but no response from housekeeping. There was also a large hole in one of the robes and were hoping we wouldn't get charged for that or the opened Voss water, we never did. There is a workout room and a fantastic locker room! Regular showers along with multi-jet showers. The multi-jet showers did not have great water pressure) and complimentary shampoo, conditioner, etc. They had lockers with washcloths, towels, robe, slippers, toiletries. There were also little baskets  with items you might have forgotten to pack - toothbrushes, feminine products, Q-tips, etc. I felt so special! They left two complimentary conditioners, as if they knew I have long, thick hair! Ha! Just an FYI, it is not soft water so beware for those of you that are used to soft water at home. I used both conditioners on my hair during one shower, because of it.We definitely plan on staying at this hotel again when visiting Chicago, without a doubt.

My dad canceled that account and alerted the hotel of this in advance, and then when we checked in, he offered to put another credit card on file and the front desk said that wouldn't be a problem. My extended family decided to stay in town for an extra 2 nights, and in advance my dad asked to extend the reservation. He repeatedly went to the front desk to ask if they needed a credit card on file and if they needed to transfer the room into my aunt and uncle's name. The front desk said that would be no problem. When my father checked out, he again confirmed that my family would be staying in the second room and if everything was okay, and the people at the front desk again said no problem.After my family arrived back in New Orleans, they had hysterical voicemails from my aunt because she was locked out of the room. The front desk said the rooms weren't paid for or reserved, so instead of contacting my aunt or my dad -- or even bothering to leave a note on their door, where all of there stuff was -- they just locked my family out. My dad was on the phone for nearly 2 hours between my frantic aunt and the hotel management who blamed my dad for the miscommunication, despite the fact my dad asked the front desk SEVERAL TIMES if the room was reserved for an extended stay and if they needed info on file (turns out, the morons at the front desk never bothered to write anything down). When everything was finally worked out, my dad asked for the hotel to comp him part of the rate for all of the headache and aggravation he went through and for locking my family out of their room without a notice and they said THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. Um, bull.My dad held his ground and said that it was ridiculous that because of their negligence we had to go through all of this, so they finally gave my aunt 50% off their last 2 nights and 3 breakfast coupons. Took a few hours to get that.Everyone understand that people make mistakes, but the hotel failed by not only refusing to acknowledge that they made one, but then they tried to blame my dad for it instead of own up to the mistake and simply fixing it.I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL!",1,0,0,0,Y,M5LtDy5By13s0W00e5n8WA,berkeley f.,"Berkeley, CA",February 2006,2,38,3,67,22,25,6,0,2,0.015612161051766639,jNOJeH4_0VVjL0s57k4Dyw,Red Hot and Blue,"Red Hot and Blue - Northeast Dallas - Dallas, TX",88,4.0,"Restaurants, Barbeque, Event Planning & Services, Caterers, Southern, METADATA","9810 N Central Expy Ste 600 Dallas, TX 75231 Neighborhood: Northeast Dallas",Yes,$$,No,http://rhnb.com,(214) 368-7427,0

First of all, the people who work there are so stuck up and have zero class. I'm a meeting planner for a very large, top rated company in Chicago and I merely called to get some information on service charges the hotel may charge. This helps me decide which hotels I'll consider using or not and since each hotel varies, I thought I'd call.  Knowing the Avenue is somewhat newish on the scene, I figured I'd give them a try - what a mistake! My first attempt at getting someone resulted in me getting transferred back to the operator only to have to repeat to him 5x that I needed to speak with someone in Sales and Catering. He didn't understand what I meant, he only understood if I said I wanted either, sales or catering. Uhh, let's use some common sense guy, transfer me to either. I'm a potential paying customer so the last thing you should be doing is arguing with me. Then I got some snarky guy Rene or something on the phone from the Sales office. I simply told him I was planning a meeting and wanted to know his hotels service charges. Rather than be friendly and answering my question he continued to badger me and ask where I was from, why I needed to know and what type of service charge did I need. He spoke to me as if I had no idea what I was asking. When I mentioned that I didn't want to give my company name and deal with RFPs at this time, I really just wanted the service charges, he just was so snotty and rude.

I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel recently due to the recommendation of a friend, an unexpectedly good rate, and because the location happened to be perfect for what I was after. The hotel is located just south of the river at the corner of Michigan and Wacker. Millennium Park and the Art Institute are within easy walking distance as you head south, and some Magnificent Mile shopping (Nordstrom and such) is within easy walking distance to the north. (Note that if you're more into the Barneys / Oak Street area of shopping then the location would not be ideal - too far of a hike.)The hotel definitely seems to be geared toward a younger, drunker set. Not to be too harsh, but there were a lot of douchebaggish and wannabe douchebaggish types. I saw a few families here but can't imagine that the place is ideal for small kids, given the noise level, and the fact that the bathrooms (at least in the standard room I was in) only have showers and not bathtubs. By the way, the shower was awful. Very inconsistent water pressure and temperature, and one of those eco, or is it Euro, type of unmovable partitions instead of a shower curtain or door, so that you basically have to get in the shower completely to turn on the water. On the plus side, the bathroom and the room in general seemed clean, modern and fresh.Overall I felt the hotel was ok for a night or two but as a thirty-something I just felt too old for the place.

Third, the cleaning staff came to clean my room at 9am on a Saturday morning and never came back to clean, replenish towels, or make the beds. Forth, was charged for mini bar items that neither I, nor my guest, used. Fifth, when I checked in around 1130pm the previous Friday, there was a very loud music in the lobby lounge making it nearly impossible to hear the receptionist tell me where my room was, nor was there anyone there to help with my bag. Lots of negatives for the ""5-star"" hotel. However, there were times where the staff redeemed itself: The strap to my heel broke and I was able to call the concierge to get super glue to fix it, and the valet hailed a cab for me and helped load my bags. Also, after contacting the managers regarding the extraneous charges, they did reimburse me. However, if given the option to stay here again I would rather stay at one of the hotels down the street a few blocks down where I've stayed there before and had much better service",2,0,0,0,Y,Ly8wyHx4IMZZOTyyeLsOng,John A.,"La Jolla, CA",December 2007,0,19,3,9,1,0,0,0,0,0.010758776896942242,6BPvL9mEkzoVxemc8LulsQ,Nijiya Market,"Nijiya Market - West Los Angeles - Los Angeles, CA",325,4.5,"Food, Grocery, Shopping, METADATA","2130 Sawtelle Blvd Ste 105 Los Angeles, CA 90025 Neighborhood: West Los Angeles",Yes,$$,None,http://www.nijiya.com/,(310) 575-3300,0
2504,1/6/2012,qqqGCoA1YQ6vtMiEre2V_Q,I am a little late on my review because I just discovered this site. My wife and I spent our wedding anniversary here in October. We couldn't go out of town but wanted to get out of the house! Even though the W is close to our condo we decided to spend the weekend here since we are big W fans! I had flowers waiting in the room when we arrived so the hotel knew it was our anniversary. They upgraded our room and treated us like it was our honeymoon. They went above and beyond our already high expectations due to years of staying at W hotels. The bartenders knew us by name and knew our drinks. The food was amazing! The pool was better then our health club. All amenities were first class.The view is one of the best in the city and worth the room rate alone. The customer service was top notch.  I will have all out of town guests stay here going forward. This hotel is the overall package. There are still other W hotels I like better but as far as hotels in Chicago this one tops them all. From the min we walked in the door we know we made the right choice. Keep up the great customer service on every level and this hotel will always be one of the best and our home away from home right here in Chicago! Thanks for making our anniversary one of the best!,5,0,0,0,Y,IRsI8mkBLpJTMuYL2uz6vw,Rachel F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",November 2009,13,116,3,116,34,33,11,0,0,0.10892018779342723,ETDGBlrzzmZO5ZttaQp-DQ,Izakaya Haru Ulala,"Izakaya Haru Ulala - Downtown - Los Angeles, CA",220,3.5,"Restaurants, Japanese, Asian Fusion, METADATA","368 E 2nd St Los Angeles, CA 90189 Neighborhoods: Downtown, Little Tokyo",Yes,$$,No,None,(213) 620-0977,0
2505,11/10/2011,DFGJroljdjzVmX-H65FHtA,"This is the last time I book any of my colleagues and clients at this hotel. We've booked with W Chicago-Lakeshore  in the past and there has always been something but this time around was the final straw. I booked a hotel stay for one of my colleagues and my colleague was suppose to check in on Sunday. I called a week prior to his check in date to prepaid for his stay (since every time I asked for a CC Auth form, I never received it). The account woman took everything over the phone and said my colleague was all set. Here comes Sunday, the day my colleague is set to check in. They will not let him check in because they require him to put his card down for room & tax. My question is...what's the point of prepaying for a room when the guest is going to have to put down his/her card for ROOM & TAX plus incidentals. My colleague called me explaining the situation that Sunday night. Then I called the hotel and spoke to the night manger, who name begins with a G. She herself told me that she can see that an authorization has been made to his account but the account woman clearly didn't input the hard swipe. Another question I have to ask, why is that our problem? That was negligence on your employee's part not ours. Then, for her to say we have to put down for incidentals and a night stay in order to stay at the hotel(which would have been $650+, after I repeatedly told her I would send the details over to her first thing in the morning and my guest can not pay for this. I don't think Ms. G understands that everyone doesn't have $650+ to give at the drop of a hat. Which is why the company was paying for his travel.To cut a long story short, my colleague was waiting outside of the hotel for about to 2hrs, at night after flying in from NY to be told he couldn't stay at their hotel because a W Chicago Lakeshore employee was negligent in processing a CC Auth form. Which lead for me to intensely search for a hotel for my colleague to stay in for that night and the next 3 days.  I am just beyond frustrated with this hotel. They treated us like we're new to doing business with them and we don't  book a lot of our colleagues and clients at their hotel.

2551,6/11/2012,yZvTHIT6H2DvtDpCp2NbPQ,"We just got back home from the Radisson. This place is just awesome.Parking is underground, as with most of Chicago's hotel, it is $43 daily and does not offer in/out privilege. Valet parking is $53 daily.  The underground parking was a bit of a maze, as it seems to handles more than just the Radisson, and depending on where you are parked, you may not be close to the elevators that are for the Radisson, otherwise you come out from the side and have to walk around the building. No big dealThe lobby was beautiful, nice fresh light brown/cream color, the lighting was soft, not overpowering. From the lobby you have access to Filini restaurant and bar. It seems that it was always busy with people walking in and out all the time. The bar was all white, with all sorts of bottles throughout the wall. I did not have a chance to try the bar or restaurant. Check in was fast and quick, I was greeted by my name and thanked for being a Club Carlson member. I was asked if I have stayed before at Radisson, which I haven't. The check in area was lightly colored and very bright lighting. I booked a executive/business room package, which allowed me early check in, I actually checked in @ 11am. Our room was on the 17th floor with lounge access. The common hallways where light green/gray in color with soft lighting. I got 2 queen beds, overlooking Chicago River and Navy Pier. Room decor was modern, European style, carpeting on the bedroom was actually light blue, also the comforter. It took me some time to get used to the color, but it was not bad at all. Bed was comfortable, 2 plushy pillows per bed, with 2 extras on the closet. The mini bar was completely full with amenities and the prices I found them to be reasonable. The mini bottles were around $5-$6, soda $3. My only complaint is that they did not give you any room to cool a bottle of water or can of soda. The bathroom was very spacious, the shower and toilet where side by side, like in a closet, sharing a glass sliding door. The shower is similar to those of Aloft hotels by Sheraton, with a rainshower head, and a shower wand. This hotel does not skimp on towels, we got 4 each, large, medium & small. They were very soft and heavy. The whole bathroom floor was dark with glass crystals that gave different colors as the light shined. My wife was very pleased with the amenities kit in the bathroom, though I forgot the brand name. The coffee machine was a Nespresso and it came with 6 pods of coffee.The lounge was in the 17th floor also, by the elevator area, overlooking Millennium park, it also has a deck too. It was also lightly colored with blue chairs. It is open from 6am-10pm. You need room key for access to it. It is unmanned between 10am-4:30pm. They have a wide selection of magazines and a tv viewing area. You can rent out free of charge an ipad if you have a business package. Breakfast is from 6am-10am, it consisted of oatmeal, plantains, hard boiled eggs, pastries and fruits. Refreshment had juice, soda, water (gas and no gas) a coffee and tea area. Lounge is still open after breakfast, except they only leave the tea, coffee (Nespresso machine), soda water and the fruit tray. From 4:30pm they have a welcome reception with wine, champagne and beer. They also had some chips, crackers and nuts. Beer was Bud, Bud light, Stella, Lagunita, and 2 local Chicago craft beer from Argus Brewery.The third floor gives you access to the indoor and outdoor pool, sauna, exercise room, and an outdoor recreation area with a park like setting. Nicely landscape with a .5 mile softly padded exercise track that goes around the hotel, and pool area. There are some bbq grills throughout the area for the residents, cabanas, and benches all around.Second floor gives you access to the restaurant.We were very pleased with this stay, the hotel is beautiful, fresh, crisp and hip. I will certainly recommend it to anyone.

First of all, it's a great location in downtown Chicago with great views from just about every angle and a short walk from the CTA. A short walk across Wacker will put you right on Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile.

2560,9/21/2009,qO2pTetSOVUYmQGFhwIg9Q,"This place was a big disappointment.  The experience really dulled my view of the W brand.  - We were initially placed in a (tiny) room directly across from an elevator bank.  We were kept awake until about 4:30am by guests in the hallway and, alternately, the elevators' chimes.  The noise began, again, around 7-7:30am.  - Without apology, the hotel said they would move us to another room the next day.  We were told we could just leave our bags in the room and they would move everything by our return that afternoon.  When we returned late in the day to get ready for a wedding, our things hadn't been moved and a new room hadn't been arranged.  After re-explaining the situation, we were offered another room with a smaller bed.  ""How much less is it a night?  We pre-paid for a king.""  ""Same price,"" the receptionist said.  ""Why would someone opt for a smaller bed at the same price?""  ""Some people like smaller beds,"" she said.  ""Yeah, but we pre-paid and opted for a King size...""  To which she said, and I'm not even kidding, ""You'll be fine.""  At which point she handed us our key.  We moved our luggage, ourselves, to the new room.  - A bunch of the cable channels weren't working properly.  But, more annoyingly, the in-room pay per view movies weren't working.  We called the front desk and they said nothing could be done.  We asked that we not be charged for the movie we couldn't watch - no problem, they said.  Apparently, there was a *little* bit of a problem because I still got charged for it and then had to plead at check-out for the charge to be taken off.  - On our final night's stay there was no running water (!).  This was Labor Day weekend, a different weekend than what was mentioned by another commenter without water.  So I guess it's a recurring issue at this hotel.  Except we didn't get offered a bottle of water or anything.  Sure, the hospitality business isn't easy - there are things that are beyond management's control.  But when you sell yourself as being a luxury brand and charge accordingly, you can't have multiple problems for a guest's stay.  And you *definitely* can't have even ONE of these issues without being extremely apologetic.  We didn't get any of that.  And it's not like we were making anything even resembling a big stink about anything at the time - though maybe we should have.  You know what would have gone a long way?  A complimentary *anything*.  It's not hard and makes slighted guests feel better:  Sorry you couldn't sleep last night, how about a cup of coffee?  Sorry we can't accommodate the size bed you pre-paid for, can we give you a drink at our bar?  Would you like us to move your luggage to your new room like we said we would?  Sorry about the water not running, here's a bottle of water on the house so you don't have to use the $5 bottle of water from the mini bar.  Nope, none of that.  Just a ""you'll be fine"" from the front desk.  Yeah, of course we'll be *fine* - but we're paying a bunch of cash to stay at a friggin' W Hotel, not a Best Western.  After my stay, the manager-person sent me a form-email asking how wonderful my stay was.  I decided to write back to see how/if they'd make amends.  So I wrote an email listing the issues.  The manager sent back another cookie-cutter email with an added line about trying to see if they could make the elevators quieter... and that she looked forward to me having a better time next time I came back to Chicago.  Huh?  Next time??  This experience has put me off staying at *any* W Hotel - least of all the the W Chicago - City Center.",1,0,0,0,Y,Ko4zG4o--DSxDRkmG51NtQ,Brooke Paramour W.,"Marietta, GA",November 2008,1,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0.0034965034965034965,0PvzVFtyuzluVPKlvlMxTw,Andy's Mediterranean Grill,"Andy's Mediterranean Grill - Walnut Hills - Cincinnati, OH",53,3.0,"Restaurants, Greek, Mediterranean, METADATA","906 Nassau St Cincinnati, OH 45206 Neighborhood: Walnut Hills",Yes,$$,No,http://www.andyskabob.com,(513) 281-9791,0

The ""quiet room"" we requested may actually be quiet when the only noise you would have to deal with is the usual hall noise, but we could hear every word (and everything) the people next door were up to until 11:30 pm, by which time we called the front desk and security asked our love bird neighbors to be a bit quieter. Perhaps these people were just exceptionally loud? But even without the noise, the King bed in our room was simply awful- it was rock hard and actually slanted towards the floor. The room itself, as so many others have pointed out, is very small (especially with a king bed) and the bathroom tiny, but  clean and well designed.

The place also has a pool, which I never tried, and also has a pizzeria, which I did not try as well.  The cleaning service is top notch.Is there a better hotel for the price range in downtown Chicago?  Maybe.  This is very much your average hotel, but I'm sure the parking option will attract customers.  The location helps too!",4,0,0,0,Y,MqCAvFMgeCn-gjsBisuFvg,c. c.,"Chicago, IL",February 2010,1,15,2,19,5,0,0,0,0,0.015416238437821172,J0Gik9hyXjO-1jSnplSVKw,Sea of Beads,"Sea of Beads - Austin, TX",17,4.0,"Shopping, Arts & Crafts, Art Supplies, Jewelry, METADATA","2438 W Anderson Ln Ste C6 Austin, TX 78757",Yes,$$,None,http://seaofbeads.net,(512) 533-9090,0

""Hey, that place looks nice, I'd like to stay there one day."" I spend a lot of time in downtown chi and rarely feel like driving home after a fun night. I remember, one night in July, I walked into this Westin with my girlfriend Lydia to inquire about the room rates for the night. We were spoken to (very rudely) by a humongous and very unattractractive manager, (I feel bad talking about him because he didn't make himself and everyone has flaws, I'm not a hyocrite) but I feel that he was taking his unhappiness with his appearance out on us. He told Lydia and I that there were no vancancies at the hotel, but a white couple walked in behind us and he ""magically"" found accomodations for them. They stated that they had not made pre-reservations and were walk-ins just like us. I wish I had gotten their info. I wrote this experience off as being a ""glitch in the system"". I returned to this hotel with my clubbing and dining buddy Lydia again after having a ""girl's night out at Ruth's Chris"" where I picked up a $350 tab. We were unable to finish our meal and had 95% of it wrapped up for enjoyment later at the hotel. This didnt happen. Due to stress, I had a panic attack and Lydia drove me to the nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital. I stayed there for about 7hrs. When I returned, Lydia called me and said that our dinner had been either thrown away or eaten by the hospitality staff.            Talk about a waste of money. Lydia complained to Sean, the manager on duty, and she and was given a meager $25.00 credit to be used at the bar downstairs in the lobby. The food at the Grill was nice. However, the very next day Chicago Police was called on me because the $5,000+ charge that had been authorized on my account for an approximate 2 week stay had exceeded by daily charge limit which is only $5,000 per day. I was told by the same manager, Sean and head of security, Ray Parede,s that my credit card was stolen and that ""those people"" and ""n words"" do this allk the time at this hotel. They said I had placed 2 different addresses on file. Did they ever think I have 2 residences???????? DUH, or are black people not allowed to OWN multiple properties? Are we not allowed to blow 5K on a 2 week hotel stay. The police showed up, verified my identity, and basically stayed in my room for 2hrs until I could call the bank and authorize the card for more money. In the interim, I missed a very important business meeting and a relaxing 4hr spa treatment. OMG, hope I don't have another panic attack. And to think Westin claims this hotel offers a retreat feeling. I feel worse than I felt at the hospital. A $440/night waste. But I feel like a young MLK doing a PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION to take a stand against the unjust treatment of ANYONE, regardless af gender, sexual orientatation, race, culture, religion, etc. Feedback is welcome.",1,0,0,0,Y,HQxWPs0oBHwGaKqsw_dxiw,Ian the midtown pub crawler S.,"Sacramento, CA",March 2008,127,104,10,193,143,172,21,230,7,0.06208955223880597,4ggFe-ctqdB_WbTPvSLTBw,Ginger And Garlic,"Ginger And Garlic - Naperville, IL",39,3.5,"Restaurants, Chinese, METADATA","1633 N Naper Blvd Naperville, IL 60563",Yes,$$,No,http://www.gingerandgarlicrestaura…,(630) 799-3888,0

I just asked for some towels and toiletries and went to bed. The second night they gave me a certificate for a free night, as it was already 11pm! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning....what a mistake. My omlette and toast were burned. They took a while to be served as well. When I complained, they offered to make it again, but I had to leave for the trade show (I worked a booth). They still charged me! They took off 20%. I complained later to the front desk.

2653,12/27/2010,CPbN-F9FHt6Vhr99C16ZBQ,"My name is Mary Claire. My husband, Joe, and I recently got married at your hotel. I have never written a note like this because I've never been so impressed with the quality of service provided at a hotel before. I just wanted to write you a note to say how truly impressed we were with your colleague, Brooke Bosak. Even though the event is over, I just can't stop thinking about how hard she worked, her kindness, her sincerity, her professionalism, her attention to detail, her enthusiasm...the list goes on!  Throughout the entire planning process (and the wedding week-end) I never really had to ask her for help with anything nor did I worry about anything because she always anticpated my needs before they were a thought in my head. We recently re-located to Madison, WI so planning from a distance was a challenge. She was always accommodating and flexible to our schedule and made sure we were well taken care of when we got to town the week-end of the wedding. I could tell that she was genuinely enthusiastic about our wedding throughout the entire planning process, our entire wedding week-end and even post-wedding! Our vendors were excited to work with her and they raved about how great she was so great to work with. Our guests also raved about the elegance that was orchestrated by her and your staff. You can tell she is really good at what she does and we really thought you should know how awesome we thought she was too!I also wanted to tell you that Beth Jostes was also amazing the night of our wedding. She took good care of us into the wee hours of the night. I know our group must have been a handful and she was extremely attentive, down to earth, very helpful, patient and fun to work with. Finally, every one of your staff we encountered was extremely welcoming and kind. I regret that I do not remember their names but it was your desk staff and bellman that were the most memorable. They remembered us by name each day, made us laugh, offered sweet marriage advice and were always smiling. They treated us like family.This was by far my most memorable hotel experience of my life. The Doubletree is truly unique in the quality of guest service you provide. Thanks to this experience my husband and I don't want to stay anywhere else besides the Doubletree.  Thank you for your time and hope you have a wonderful holiday!Sincerely,Mary Claire",5,0,0,0,Y,j8EHmuebLe8avjeFqrL0eg,Jessica W.,"Phoenix, AZ",February 2010,56,138,10,314,152,157,46,17,4,0.14182939362795477,xgwJ85y1hSAj58hB9374dQ,Buttercup Grill & Bar,"Buttercup Grill & Bar - East Oakland - Oakland, CA",77,3.5,"Restaurants, American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, METADATA","1000 Cotton St (between Dennison St & Livingston St) Oakland, CA 94606 Neighborhood: East Oakland",Yes,$$,None,http://www.buttercupgrillandbar.com,(510) 535-1640,0
2654,7/1/2010,A3_51OtozG7wrsgCtV2G9w,"DO NOT book your wedding at this venue.  Of all of the vendors I anticipated problems with when I booked my wedding, this would have been my last choice, and was by far the worst to have to deal with.  Initially booking under the excellent wedding coordinator of Rebecca Kuzelka, we were unaware that she would be abruptly let go a few weeks later.  Which the hotel did not contact me about, rather I found out through a returned email that I sent to Rebecca.  She was then replaced with the existing events planner who quit a few months later, the Doubletree once again never letting me know of the change, rather I found through a phone call to the Doubletree where they told me she was no longer there.  Finally they hired a new wedding coordinator, Brooke Bosak.  She did a nice job picking up where the others had left off, however her assistance in the back-office proved to be poor which is why I am writing a negative review.  These are the reasons we were dissatisifed with their service:- The final bill was incorrect, not taking into account the down payment we had made on the venue (which was a large percentage of the total cost) and incorrect service rates were used, that we did not sign on in the original contract.- In the final set-up (which I received a few days before the wedding because the ""system was down"") they had the wrong set-up (rounds of 8 instead of rounds of 10 which I had gone over with all three coordinators).  This would have been a disaster if I wouldn't have caught it because we had assigned seating at the wedding.- We went on our honeymoon immediately after the wedding.  I returned from my honeymoon to the incorrect amount being charged to my credit card for the reception with the old service rates (which I had fixed before the wedding) but had been changed back and charged to my credit card without my approval.  - Was charged $1,000 worth of room damage to our hotel suite which was absurd.  When I asked the hotel to provide reasons for this damage they provided pictures of three pathetic scratches which looked like normal wear-and-tear and could have been rubbed out with polish.  One of the tables they sent a picture of with a scratch on it was never even used by us during our stay. Also provided a picture of a hanging light the photographer had moved during pictures that was somehow shattered in the picture (but was not on our departure).  I accepted responsibility for that because the photographer had moved it, that was worth maximum $20.  All of the bridesmaids (which included 6 adult women) who I told about these charges and had been in the room that day were disgusted with the Doubletree for this.  I was able to get them to take off $500 after complaing and then another $50 when I reminded them that they shattered one of my champagne glasses at dinner.  I was acutally going to let that go, but not after this!- The night before the wedding I went to my maid of honor's room to share a bottle of wine before the big day.  We called down for a bottle opener and it took an hour and a half for them to bring it.  If you don't want to deal with a headache, then don't book your wedding here.",2,0,0,0,Y,H1lfbihXaBWwTMsiNv_gpg,Jessica S.,"Chicago, IL",March 2008,16,15,1,24,20,11,10,0,0,0.008955223880597015,8yhmSq4jGr2K7SrT5qWScA,The Sweet House,"The Sweet House - Outer Richmond - San Francisco, CA",102,4.0,"Food, Specialty Food, Candy Stores, Desserts, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, METADATA","3512 Balboa St (between 36th Ave & 37th Ave) San Francisco, CA 94121 Neighborhood: Outer Richmond",No,$,No,None,(415) 876-1388,0

2692,8/7/2010,NWy-i1gLOSZYNzoe7Dyd1g,"I recently had the worst consumer experience I've had in years with this hotel. Although the hotel looks beautiful, I would avoid staying here, no matter what, because what happened to us was not an aberration, but a result of hotel policy. They called us just after midnight, when we were about 10 minutes from arriving and told us the hotel was oversold and that our room was not available. Their solution was for us to come in and get our ""walk slip"" and then take it to another hotel in the suburbs near the airport. We were to pay full price and the other hotel was not a suite, but a room with one bed. So $250 bucks for a room comparable to what we could have booked for 75 bucks. I told them that staying in a room on Michigan Ave, in a suite with a pool and spa on the 30th floor is a bit different from a roadside motel in the suburbs. The person calling told me, ""since the city is oversold, that is all we can offer."" I explained that we had booked weeks in advance, that we were following each other in 2 cars in a city we didn't know well after midnight and that we had already driven over 600 miles that day and we were quite tired, so trying to find another hotel and then having some of us sleep on the floor was a real inconvenience. I asked for a second room, or to be booked in a downtown hotel and they simply repeatedly said, ""Sir, I am only authorized to put you in this room."" We were moving from California to Virginia and we were very excited to stay at this hotel, because the suite allowed my college age son and his finace the pull out sofa in the living room, while our 5 year old could just sleep in the king with us. The location is great and we had lived there when oldest son was a toddler, so we were going to show them the area and to go to the Cubs game the following day at noon. So we were very bummed about not staying downtown.I began to feel very sorry for the employee who had called us because she let slip that she had done this several nights in a row and that she was very embarrassed about this hotel's policy about over booking. She clearly understood that we were not going to be able to find another downtown hotel at this late hour. When I went on the hotel website to make a complaint to the central office, I was surprised to see that the Hilton site has a tab for complaints about overbooking of their hotels, so this is clearly an ongoing problem for this chain and in particular this hotel. Fortunately, we usually stay at Marriott's and since we have ""gold status"" from business travel, they were able to find us a hotel in the suburbs with 2 rooms for 75 bucks per room. We finally got to our room at 2:20am.  I stay about 75 nights a year in hotels, which is not usually fun, but if you book in a nice hotel, the service is usually great and in the 21st century, you can certainly expect a room to be held for you when you arrive if you've made a reservation with a credit card, after all if you don't show for any reason, they will certainly charge you for the night. I was really amazed that these jerks would carry out this kind of policy on an ongoing basis.

We had breakfast in the adjacent restaurant the next morning and found good service and fresh food cooked well.I give the Whitehall 4 stars primarily because of the VALUE of the place.

When I checked in the staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms hadn't been cleaned in I don't know how long, I had to walk around in shoes because the carpet was wet everywhere and I was afraid to let anything touch me directly. The room was hot and stuffy and the air conditioner didn't do much. I even had to put towels down on the bed because the sheets were disgusting. However, I was charged not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times for parking. I had to call three different times to get these charges taken off. And the last time I talked to a manager she acted as if she was doing me a favor by not charging me for parking, even though I didn't park there!At first I overlooked the charges because the staff that checked me in was super nice. However, the General Manager was very rude and unprofessional. They had charged me so many times I was even charged overdraft fees on my debit card and when I asked for him to reimburse me he said he would transfer me to the Accounting Department and then proceeded to hang up. When I called back he said he was the Accounting Department and said that he wouldn't talk to me. I asked if he could transfer me to someone who would try to help me but he refused. I paid almost $200 for this room, minus all the extra charges, but I still cannot believe how terrible I was treated. Very unprofessional and rude. After having to stay in my dump of a room and to be treated like I was the one causing all the problems was just astonishing to me. As a General Manager I feel as if you should handle problems instead of handing me off to front desk staff.

You'd think they would want to return calls to make sure you get a room? I had to call an additional service, the Starline Booking number to make reservations and the only reason I did that was because of going there for a wedding party staying there. If the entire wedding party hadn't been staying at this hotel, I would not have bothered due to the many phone calls and frustrating experience in even trying to book a room! The reservation hotline is also not much help because they seem to know nothing about the hotel, area of town, or features.*Plain Jane, bare minimal decoration rooms. For a hotel that charges $349 a night - $349 a night on up! They sure do have some basic, ugly rooms. Everything is very plain, the room wasn't even stocked with toilet paper or kleenex - we had to go ask for some, the rooms are brown carpet, brown headboard, white towels, white bedding. Plain and ugly.*Doorman/ bell hops - they were friendly and nice but paid no attention to taking care of luggage! Luggage cases were dragged out of taxi with very little care and dragged across the sidewalks and into the hotel - scraping up the luggage until I noticed! Our luggage had wheels on them - they were dragging the suitcases down sidewalk and through lobby without using the wheel side - thank you for scraping and damaging my new luggage.If I could give this hotel 0 stars, I would, but unfortunately you can't click 0.

My friend and I left to have a few drinks only then could I bring myself to say we should stay there. $55 was reasonable which left me a few hundred more to spend out for the night.  When I came in a 3:30 AM I decided to take a look at the other floors and the roof. It was worth the experience the views are amazing and if you are a fan of history this place has it. In 1936 Serial Killer Robert Nixon killed one of his victims on the fifth floor of this hotel. The over night clerk says he isn't sure which room it happened in but room 515 is creepy. Since I know the murder took place on the fifth floor that could be the spot. I did drop my toothbrush on the floor so it was lost forever and yes it smells and yes the walls are cracked and crumbling but to be in the heart of the city for that cheap of a price was well worth it.

2715,6/13/2011,-7ik20gkTrEIQbtJ9OOcYw,"Sutton Place in the Right Place: Being Chicago suburbanites, we had decided to ""vacation"" in Chicago for an evening. We looked for a hotel that would allow us to be close to the things we wanted to enjoy and The Sutton Place Hotel had the right location. (Be sure to check for specials and consider the different types of rooms. The prices vary widely.) Our first impression as we checked in was that the lobby was dark and the staff was unfriendly. Once we got to the room, things were much better. (The elevator was one of the fastest I have ever ridden.) The Deluxe King Room was spacious and had a nice view of Rush St. The bathroom was huge for a hotel. The tub was big enough for two! The room included a nice sound system with a CD player and a few CDs. Unfortunately the CDs had seen better days and there was a lot of skipping. The location of this hotel is great if you want to experience Rush St. with a minimum of travel. We went to dinner at Gibsons, had drinks at Dublin's Pub, and listened to jazz at The Back Room without walking more than a half block. Many drinks later we retired for the evening. A soak in the tub was a perfect way to wind down. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. The A/C was very quiet, but effective at keeping the room cool. In the morning we went to The Original Pancake House which is right across the street. The apple pancake was delicious! Once again, the location of this hotel was our primary reason for choosing it. As we checked out after a wonderful stay, we were surprised by the steep cost of valet parking. I thought that $40/day for a guest of the hotel was a little steep. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep Sutton Place in mind for our next trip to Rush St.",4,4,2,0,N,MsLtQW9mk6wQ01cXhUotlg,Jana P.,"Houston, TX",March 2010,157,283,29,692,459,339,182,226,6,0.29947089947089944,oQe_-77F-22Pok6Nzw5IqQ,Taiyo Ramen,"Taiyo Ramen - Ala Moana - Honolulu, HI",197,4.0,"Restaurants, Japanese, METADATA","451 Piikoi St Ste 105 Honolulu, HI 96814 Neighborhood: Ala Moana",Yes,$,No,None,(808) 589-2123,0
2716,4/17/2011,EnUvlaimkOw0y8szNeaC3Q,"Overall, nice room but with some quirks. I checked in to this hotel for a 8 night stay. When I got to the front desk, they didn't have my reservation. Great. Luckily, I had my Expedia confirmation page and everything was squared away. My room was on the 6th floor and had a view of nothing great, just the nearby neighborhood of condos and Rush St. below. The room was pretty spacious. It had a decent size closet, king size bed, desk, dresser with TV on top, mini bar, and a lounge chair with an ottoman. Closet had an extra pillow, lots of hangers, and laundry bags. The bathroom was very nice. It had 1 sink, a toilet (yes, obvious), a shower, and a separate bath tub. They had a lot of towels in there and also a terry cloth robe for use. There was also shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, and 2 different bars of soap (one was aloe and the other was oatmeal I think). The maid was always good about replenishing the supply of bath goodies everyday. I liked that. They also had a hair drier for guest use. Wi-fi is not free and there is a daily rate. However, you can get free internet just by signing up as a member of the Sutton Hotel hotels. Signing up to be a member is free and you can do this on their website. When I was setting up my laptop, I called down to the front desk and told them I had a membership and they gave me the code for the Wi-fi. Pretty simple. Maid service was great here. They always did my room in a timely manner, did the bed, put fresh towels, and refilled on the bath goodies. Fantastic! So with the above, I would have given this place 4 stars but not everything was that great. I had a huge issue with the bedding. The bedding consisted of 4 huge pillows (awesome), a mattress cover, and a thin comforter. Where were the rest of the sheets? During my stay, Chicago was in the 40's to the 50's at night, and I had a hard time sleeping because I was freezing my ass off. I had to get up and turn the heat up to 77 just to get comfortable enough to sleep. Another issue was the Wi-fi. It was very weak. I couldn't even load two pages simultaneously. Annoying. The shower in the bathroom was also an issue in that it leaked water. I'm not even sure from where it leaked, however the first time I used it and I got out, there was water that ran all over the floor and then on to the carpet at the bathroom doorway. From the stain on the carpet outside the bathroom door, I could see that I wasn't the first guest that had this issue. I used the shower only once because of this and just stuck to baths (which isn't bad) the rest of my stay. Location was pretty good. It was in between 2 Red line stations so it was easy to get on the L and go around the city. It's also fairly close to the John Hancock Observatory and the shops on Michigan Ave. Overall, it was a good value when booking through Expedia in advance. Can't say I would stay here again though.",3,4,1,0,N,jaPKPIS9stKsE7pxBmz8Bw,Benedict carne chung B.,"Pearland, TX",April 2011,33,41,4,6,2,0,2,25,0,0.07468123861566485,wka6eg4cG8zqwr6ABraFtA,Sikdorak,"Sikdorak - Honolulu, HI",223,4.0,"Restaurants, Korean, METADATA","655 Keeaumoku St Honolulu, HI 96814",Yes,$$,No,None,(808) 949-2890,0

I'd recommend this place to anyone who wanted a nice mix of people watching but a nice quiet bed to lay their head down on afterwards. Located right by Morton's, Carmine's and Jilly's, it's the perfect place to grab a martini, a nice meal and watch people pass by under the canopies. The staff here are tremendously friendly and really go out of their way to accommodate you. The first night I went on a frantic search looking for the ice machine which I'm used to be in a private room in the corner but after a walk up and down the hall, I finally called the front desk inquiring where such a thing was. Apparently, they really value their quiet here at Sutton Place and room service brings up anything you need at any hour. That a little odd to me but I did notice there was a lack of drunken loud parties, walls thumping and loud music in general which was a plus. The room was comfortable, spacious, had a great view and it was easy to sleep like a baby here. The king size bed was like that of fairy tales and the goose down pillows literally cradled my head.

Internet was $9.95/day and a pain to deal with. I was told, upon check in, that because of the way I'd booked the room, the internet was included in the price of my stay. But, lo and behold, the charges were on my bill when it came check out time. And I had to argue with the front desk staff to get it taken off, and they acted like they were doing me a big favor. Also, the last day of my stay, the wireless was ""unavailable"" and there was no one onsite who knew what to do to fix it. The # of channels available on the cable TV selection was pretty lame. And like others said, the sheets kept coming off the bed, which was pretty annoying. The good points about this hotel is that the staff (aside from the whole internet debacle) was very accomodating and friendly and it was quiet (although the fact that I was on the 21st floor may have had something to do with the lack of street noise). It wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are much better places in Chicago to stay for the same price.

If you do a day rental, you can avoid the daily parking fee, by returning to car to Enterprise, since they are located in the same structure. -Take a Drive to Wisconsin: As a huge cheese lover, I was over the top giddy when I found out Wisconsin was only an hour away.

No restrictions on the weight or breed (which is awesome because I have a pitbull, which can sometimes be an issue). There's a pet station outside equipped with bags to pick up messes.  I'm staying Sunday - Tuesday: using a AAA discount, Sunday night was $152 & Monday was $215. If you have AAA discount, use it - I saved like $40 & who isn't a fan of saving money? Oh, and I booked the hotel about 10 hours before we arrived. Free Internet?! WHOO HOO! Maybe I'm just cheap so I never get to experience this, but that is oh-so-awesome in my world. Hence...sitting in the hotel room after an 18 hour car ride...and I decided I was happy enough to write a review instead of sleep. I can smoke in the room. No worries, they have non-smoking rooms as well, but I am such a fan of smoking in my hotel rooms so I am LOVING it here :) Bonus: Air conditioning was all ready on & it's simple to control to make it cooler. BOOYAH! The TV is nice - fridge, microwave, coffee pot & work station in the room. The bed seems comfy enough. While Philippe's review made me roll with laughter, his comment is legit. The shower is a little awkward! Though it may be entertaining for some situations ;) The room is clean. The staff is friendly. While breakfast sounds delicious, I can't imagine I'll ever be up early enough for it. Check-in isn't until 3PM, but they do try to honor early check-ins. Check-out is at noon.   Parking - there is a garage behind the hotel. Make sure you get a ticket & you get it validated by the hotel. By doing this, you may come & go as you please & it'll be free. Without the validation, you will have to pay. It's located on Madison so you actually need to drive past the hotel, take a right on Washington, a right on Wells and then a right on Madison. It's right behind the hotel, but there is an unloading zone in-between the garage & the hotel if you need/want it. The low down on the vending machines: First floor has snacks, ice cream & soda. Second floor has soda & snacks. All other floors have soda machines. All the soda vending machines are Coke, but there is one PEPSI machine on the 6th floor. It's not located where the other machines are on different floors - the Pepsi machine is tucked away where the ice machine would be on the 6th floor (if they had an ice machine). The ice machines are on various floors - it is listed in that space what floors have ice. There is also a recycling station located by the ice machines. YaY recycling! I think all the room service is out-sourced. The pizza, for example, is from a chain restaurant (that I don't support), but you shouldn't be coming to Chicago to eat chain pizza anyways! Do yourself a favor & hit one of the places recommended on Yelp :) It's nice & dark in the room so it's going to be easy taking a nap at 5PM...also a plus for me cause I love napping!

Recently renovated, the decor is charming. Walking in to the spacious and attractive lobby, greeted by smiling and helpful staff, you know you are in for a treat. Its location is simply unbeatable--right across the street from Lincoln Park, a couple of blocks from the North Ave. Beach, a stone's throw from major bus lines (the 22, the 151) that will get you anywhere around Chicago you care to go. Our particular room was small but affordable, well-kept and attractively decorated in sort of a ""Mad Men"" '60's style (to borrow a description from other reviewers).  Larger rooms are available, but as we spent all of our time out exploring Chicago, the size of the room was not a problem for us. Oh, and do ask for a lake view room--so worth it! The hotel also has a wonderful little breakfast cafe with delicious cherry scones and raspberry muffins made fresh daily, and a great restaurant for dinner. The rooftop bar is now open and holy moly what a view! The bar is a real party scene on the weekends, but go up during the week when it's a bit quieter and enjoy a drink while watching the sunset--it is heavenly! The staff is excellent--friendly, professional, knowledgeable and just plain fun! Although there is no concierge as such, everyone behind the lobby counter was able to answer our touristy questions (where is the nearest ATM, which bus will get us to xyz, where is the best local place to get an Italian meat sandwich...).

They overbooked the hotel and kept trying to turn our guests away - despite having had reservations for months! And they didn't seem able to cope with guests inquiries and issues because they seemed overwhelmed.

The first thing I noticed upon entry was the smell of the place.  I think they use Drakkar or some other mens' cologne for their mop water or just have guys walking around spritzing it into the air.  I guess there are worse smells in the world.  I just don't like the cheese ball smell of cologne.  The free smells at Jimmy Johns are better.

2784,5/29/2011,ycMMyAxoDPaXfnLOgUisQw,"I believe this may have been my first time staying at a Westin hotel, and it was very nice.  I was on the 3rd floor with a pleasant view of the river and the garden terrace below.  The weather wasn't terrific the 3 days I spent in the Windy City, but it was still a nice view to have.  The bed was really great, one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever had the pleasure to sleep in.  The room was nicely laid out, with a spacious and well lit bathroom (I dig the lighted mirror).  I also appreciated the inclusion of some nice teas with the coffee machine & not just coffee as I don't drink it. I was there for a conference, and the conference facilities on the lower levels were rather nice.  They provided tables to sit at instead of just chairs, which I love since I tend to take a lot of notes on a laptop or, in this case, my new iPad.   I ordered room service for two meals, one lunch & one dinner, and I felt like the food was good, but it was priced a couple dollars too high in my personal opinion.  I haven't had the best of luck ordering anything with avocados east of Nevada and getting good ripe ones, but the ones on my sandwich were perfect here, so kudos for that. I did have occasion to sit in the hotel bar awhile, which I felt, like most hotel bars, was overpriced a few bucks at least.  I was also disappointed my last night there, while killing an hour before leaving for the airport, that my cheese platter took almost 30 mins to be brought to me... I know it doesn't take that long to cut cheese, half an apple, and put the apricot chutney in the little bowl!   Overall I'd stay here again without hesitation.  I know the snack tricks now (get them at the gift shop & just ignore the mini bar) and the room was very comfy & relaxing during my conference down time.",4,2,0,0,N,i7aOky5Np2PaDyXM7lTRdQ,Jeanne L.,"San Francisco, CA",July 2008,10,92,0,39,12,7,9,0,0,0.0592401802962009,pGx8xsWzgHqugRbHSfJmqA,Reid's Ultimate Breakfast,"Reid's Ultimate Breakfast - Brockton, MA",7,3.5,"Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, METADATA","2021 Main St Brockton, MA 02301",No,$,No,None,(508) 588-4960,0
2785,10/10/2009,N7BlH7aM9TXjHD404nKioQ,"Took a quick trip to Chicago and decided to stay at an old favorite the Westin Chicago River North. I'm Platinum Elite, in the Starwood Preferred Guest, frequent guest program and based on my past stays, this property is very consistent in it's treatment of guests, especially Elite members. Location has good access to the loop, just a ten to 15 minute walk to Macy's on State Street or Michigan Avenue shopping. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation. You can use either of the L Stations on Lake or the Grand Street station on the Red line. Each of these three station are 5 to 10 minute walk (based on if you have luggage and weather) from the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I was the only person checking in. There is a separate Gold/Platinum check-in Line, since I was the only person, there was no need to use it. Check-in was pleasant, I was recognized as a Platinum member and returning guest. If you are the type of person who loses hotel folios or needs to submit one with an expense report be sure to ask that a folio be emailed to you at check-out. Assigned a suite on the 20th floor just down the hall from Executive Club.  The room faces the marina towers.  The room is maintained but the entry way has a slightly ""dated"" feeling.  There is a wet-bar to the left of the entry, once you enter the a parlor room. The granite makes it feel heavy and dark, which is why I think it's dated. There is a closet of the entry for added storage. The parlor portion of the room has the previously used Westin decor scheme, but again, everything is well maintained, rooms are spotless. I got a tip that they will be refreshing rooms, which will be welcomed. There is a flat panel with HD channels and each room comes with complementary access to a mac computer. The room is well lit considering it's location and there is ample lighting. The desk is located by the window and has plenty of work space and sockets for phones, cameras, PDAs, etc.  In my honest opinion, the only negative is there is no bathroom in the parlor. At the far end of the parlor, is the entry to the bedroom. These are some of the largest hotel bedrooms I've ever stayed in, it's very spacious. The room consist of a large closet, heavenly bed, plasma TV, ipod docking station and river view seating. Opposite the entry is the bathroom.  Consistent with the room size, the bathroom is huge. HUGE!  Three 3 people could easily use this bathroom at once. Single sink with good counter space, large soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of towels. The marble does date the room and because it's dark makes the bathroom feel dark as well.  The negative, there is only one since and the there was not a full compliment of Westin brand toiletries in the room. There was bar soap, condition and shampoo. No lotion, shower gel or mouthwash. I carry my own, but it's food for thought. This property has a Westin Executive Club.  It's a nice lounge with good views of the Loop and Near Westside. The morning of my stay, there was a Continental spread and the evening presentation consisted of two hot foods (dumplings and something else) and various fruits and cheeses. Not the best, but not bad. In my stays, I don't ever recall the lounge being crowded or busy. The Fitness Center [AKA Westin Workout] is located on the lower levels of the hotel tower.  It's one of the few Gyms with an attendant who verifies your room and status. For a large urban hotel, the space is small but adequate.  The hotel does not have a pool. There is a business Center on the first level, just before the elevators.  Note, there is a sign that indicates you can print a boarding pass, however, the PC's are not programmed for carriers which have a second screen to print a pass.   If you encounter a problem, ask the concierge for assistance. The hotel is wired for with High Speed Wired & Wireless Internet Access.  As with most Starwood branded properties, wifi is free in the lobby.  If your assigned a room on the Executive Club Level, you're provided with a mac in your room. The hotels lobby is Wide open lobby.  In the many stays I've had at this property, I've met friends in the lobby and I don't ever recall there being more than 5 people there. It's a nice space with good light and access to the river. Embers restaurant is just off the lobby. FINAL IMPRESSION The staff is professional, courteous and very helpful. Everyone I encountered was pleasant from the door man to the lounge attendant.  The hotel is clean and well maintained. The location is great so no car is needed. I would return and recommend this hotel for business and leisure travelers.  Leisure travelers and those traveling with children need to remember there is no pool. The staff, platinum recognition and lounge, give it an edge on other properties. In winter I like being on Michigan avenue, but all the shoppers can be stressful so the WRN is a good place to set up base.

The room contained a lovely chaise lounge by the window, an extremely comfortable king bed, a fluffy robe, a delightful high-pressure shower head, etc. Overall my only complaint would be that the in-room internet is on the slow side. Next, the food, while tending towards the heavy, meat-laden side (not that meat-laden is a bad thing) is delicious. Meals served during the event, a meal I ate in the bar and in-room dining were all super. The sushi bar in the lobby is a nice touch and the burger I got delivered to my room was huge and amazing. Room service took about 45 minutes to arrive, so that is on the longer side, but it was worth it. The conference facilities downstairs were classy. Good lighting and a high level of service from the staff at all times. But one thing: not enough plugs!

2788,1/2/2009,nQ4pL5cxtjeFdXLXY9jb0g,"I go to Chicago a fair amount on business and have stayed at the Westin several times. Its a comfortable place and a convenient location (House of Blues is right next door), but there are some annoyances. I actually booked my next stay at a different hotel. I'd certainly stay at the Westin again but at the moment it's not my first choice. First, some good stuff. The staff is great -- very friendly and professional. If you need a cab, the doorman is good and aggressive at getting you set up. The lobby and room decor are great, the bed very comfortable, the rooms spacious, and the shower double-headed. So far so good. The problems start with the TV. I fired my TV at home years ago, so this a TV on the road is quite a novelty, so I'd like it to work and have some channels. Despite it being a nice big LCD, they apparently don't have much in the way of cable. Yes HBO, but no Comedy Central, and some stations don't have sound. Kinda defeats the purpose. I have to have Internet access too. No wireless in the rooms, but that's would be passable except that the past two times I went, the Ethernet cord had a broken tip & kept slipping out. To their credit they fixed it when I pointed it out, but housekeeping should be trained to check these things and proactively make sure it's OK. Oh, and here's a tip, Westin: snagless Cat 5 cable has been around forever. Give it a try. Room service is good if you get the right thing -- they have a baked red fish that's excellent. But the cheeseburger is truly awful. You can get sushi delivered -- very cool -- but the one time I ate downstairs at the sushi bar, it was questionable (I did a separate review on that). The breakfast buffet has some tasty items but is far too small, and there's a disappointing lack of fresh waffles or omelettes.

To be honest, it was nicer than The Drake in a lot of ways, and I certainly prefer the rooms at The Talbott. I'd actually stay here over The Drake next trip. We stayed in a standard king, which was over 500 square feet! I love boutique hotels because they have so much more charm, and this one had a lot of it. Downstairs, they have the restaurant Bice, which is very classy too. It's true that the little things make this place so charming such as: a small living room, a designer remote control, Aveda products, excellent bathrooms with nice lighting and a bathrobe, free umbrellas, complementary passes to EQUINOX fitness, 3 telephones, electronic maid service displays, and a newspaper hung on the door in a cute little Talbott bag. Additionally, the room came with a lot of Chicago magazines for hot spots, as well as a beautiful Small Luxury Hotels of the world book (which is free for you to take and very handy!)

But those other 5-star joints are internationally known and with that comes the crowds, the lack of personal attention and outrageous prices. And then there is The Talbott Hotel. I'm a big fan of boutique hotels and The Talbott is one of the best I have ever experienced. No you don't have a massive lobby or numerous restaurants and shops inside the structure. But you do get a wonderfully appointed room with a large bathroom. The furniture is new and above all comfortable. Flatscreen televisions might not be the norm at all hotels but they are at The Talbott and they are HD. But I think it's the little things that really make the Talbott special. Their bath towels are huge and soft. They have complimentary Aveda products in the bathrooms. There is a full sized umbrella in the closet. There is a telephone next to the toilet just in case you need to do business while you are doing business. If you stay at the Talbott expect to be warmly greeted by everyone that works there. And I'm not talking about simple hellos but ""How are you today?"" and ""Where are you travelling from?"" types of questions.

2821,8/30/2010,WbcqR81uxUcGwdPdXT6mPw,"I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it.  Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least.   But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel.  First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention).   I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork.  The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains.   I definitely love the room.  While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task.  So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in.  My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof.  I mean, seriously.  They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason.  I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel.   First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation.  The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent.  First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either.  Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there.   But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM.  As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account.  Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite.  So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes.  Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor).  The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold.  It was pathetic room service at its finest.   We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant.  The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself.

So we cranked it down to the minimum temperature allowed, 65, and went out. Returned several hours later, still hot. Maybe it didn't click on? Tried to re-set it but we ultimately ended up suffering through a sticky, sweaty night. This is when we noticed the unbelievably shitty quality of the bedding. Stiff, sandpaper-y, cheap. First thing in the morning, I notified the front desk that our AC might be broken. We went out and came back maybe 4-6 hours later to find that nothing had been done. When the maintenance guy finally came, he confirmed that it was broken and he called downstairs to get our room changed. Waited at least a 1/2 hour for a bellhop to come move our bags, never did.

I told the concierge that we were in town for our anniversary so they made sure that we had a great room overlooking the river and straight ahead was the Trump Hotel. The location is seriously unreal for the price. The neighborhood hotels are The Hardrock, Trump Towers, etc (all high end hotels). Restaurants and entertainment is all walking distance.

2831,9/13/2011,oFMxmOhZBSijUMtqu1YU0A,"This hotel is fantastic for a traveler there on Business or a couple who is planning on being out site seeing most of the day. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are efficient. I have stayed in much smaller rooms. The room didn't feel cramped at all. We booked a room in the River Hotel(floors 3-10) but we got a room in the Club Quarters(11 and up). Since it was as described, I imagine it was the same accommodations I could expect from the River Hotel, just with a better view. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, and accommodating. There is no Iron in the room, but there is one available on one of the other floors. There are water bottles available that you can fill up, which was fantastic. We ended up getting them for my parents too, because water at their hotel was $8. We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but it looked very nice, and is highly rated. The outdoor tables are super cute. I think the best thing about this hotel though is the location. It's right on the Chicago River near Michigan Avenue. There is so much that is within walking distance. It is also super close to L stops. The closest one is State/Lake, which has the Red line, and a couple others. A block up at Clark/Lake is the Blue Line that will take you to/from O'Hare. It's easy walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, State St, the Art Institute. There are also easy buses to Lincoln Park Zoo and Navy Pier. There is a Corner Bakery Cafe located right next door too for a cheap, good breakfast, or a lite snack. I also felt very safe at this hotel, after midnight you have to be buzzed in, you also have to use your key to access the Elevator. Apparently this is a Historic Building also. At one time, briefly, it was the tallest Building in Chicago, it is also considering the skinniest Sky Scraper in Chicago. It's a beautiful building! If you are someone who is looking for a small, nice, efficient room close to everything, this place is perfect for you. If you are looking for a big, luxurious room with all sorts of amenities, this place probably isn't for you. Considering its about $75 less a night than most of the surrounding hotels though, it's a fantastic deal!

It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer.

2834,6/1/2011,TlN,"I visited Chicago for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago and spent both of them at the River Hotel. My experience was a positive one. This hotel is located in what i think is a perfect place, right in front of the river, walking distance to lots of places (restaurants, bars, magnificent mile, millennium park).  It is pretty nice, clean, great service.  It has a 24hr lobby service.   Their restaurant is pretty good/not bad.  They have a really good pannini for lunch (brie, with cranberry mayo, smoked turkey and green apple).  Their breakfasts, however, were just okay.  I recommend going to the Coner Bakery just a couple of yards away for breakfast. I really like the fact that they have, on every floor, a filtered water dispenser with empty bottles.  I personally drink plenty of water and not having to buy water during my stay was a plus for me. They also have a 'computer room' with 2 (or was it 3?) pcs with access to internet and printer.  This was great to have and came in handy when i realized we had forgotten to print our boat tour confirmation and needed it that afternoon.  It's also handy if you want to check in before going to the airport.  Ah, the train station is only about 4-5 blocks away.  We actually arrived from South Bend, IN via train and were able to find the hotel fairly quickly. One con:  VERY small rooms.  Very small.  It was 3 of us in one room so it was a bit...  uncomfortable at times; but not so much, really, as we spent most of our time walking around Chicago.  But consider this if you plan to stay here. Free WIfi.  Yes, all over the property.  Huge plus too. Overall, we were all very happy staying at the River Hotel and thus, it gets 5 stars.

Stayed there for four nights.  Definite plus was the availability of free laundry on the 10th floor.  Would have been better if one of the dryers wasn't broken because that meant two washers trying to dry in one drier.  Luckily only one other person was doing laundry so it was something that could be accomplished. The water bottles and water was a nice touch.  I preferred getting a large water bottle and filling that one.   I didn't try the work out room so I can't say anything about it. Location is fantastic.  Easy to get to the loop and therefore access to all the trains. If anything is an issue expect the front desk to deal with it quickly.  Now that is the issue.  One would not expect things to go wrong all that often, but they do but on the plus side they are dealt with quickly. But it's the little things. No hair drier -- one supplied.  Room said to have a 'kitchenette' -- well one person's kitchenette is another person's fridge and microwave - no plates or utensils or.....  Bathroom supplies not replenished, but if you ask they are there.  Then the A/C broke.  Tried to explain that it wasn't the thermostat but was the compressor but we had to go through the steps of replacing the batteries in the thermostat and allowing it to fail to fix the problem.  Kind of like calling India when your computer has a failure code.  Follow the script.  But there was a new room supplied, not exactly the same but close.  And they said they would move us from one room to the other but that wasn't done but I didn't care because then I knew it was done correctly. Overall, if you can get a great price then try the place but I rate it comparable to the SpringHill Suites (River North) or the Holiday Inn (Merchandise Mart).  If you can get Residence Inn (either downtown) then I would select those.

Jennifer, my coordinator was helpful, friendly and unfortunately also a victim of this monstrosity of a business. My wedding looked a little shabby and as I marched down the aisle, I almost cried at how awful the ceremony looked. I couldn't believe that my instructions were not followed as I laid them out. That may or may not have been the fault of my mother. My wedding favors were never set out or returned to me. My guest book disappeared. My wedding coordinator came up to me (after My vows were read) and told me my cake was not there, and that I would have to sorta pantomime cutting a piece of cardboard for my photographs and guests. (amazing how no one confirmed that my cake was made maybe a day or two before). It wasn't until later I discovered what actually happened. The cake was outsourced to Bake for Me on Roosevelt. Jennifer assured me that my cake would be great. When I came in for my cake tasting, some 2 or 3 months earlier (an appointment that was made) I had to fight for the attention of person given a tasting to 3 or 4 other couples (why did I have to make an appointment?) Apparently, after I made my cake choice, My order was stuck in the back of a file, never to see the light of day. After I returned from my honeymoon, I was told I had to pursue the bakery (not the hotel who had a agreement with this bakery) for a refund. After all, all you did was make us cut a piece a cardboard and have my guests eat cake from Jewel - Osco). I was so heartbroken, All I could do is drink Tequila Sunrises at my open bar (which I was told was upgraded, but also closed 1/2 hr early).

2858,6/28/2009,xyUY5VPh,"Stayed here for one night while I was in town to catch a rock show at the Empty Bottle club (maybe 3-4 miles away and Crowne Plaza is one of the closer hotels to it).  Got a good deal on the room and I've stayed at CP's in other cities when going to shows and events, so I'm kinda used to them.   The desk staff, as usual for a CP, were not great, but were decent.  The concierge and doormen were somewhat better. The bathroom seemed pretty clean and new, and the room had a balcony which was a nice touch if it didn't overlook a freeway/ parking lot/ garage.  Nope, you're not paying for ""view"" here.  The balcony is also secluded by concrete walls from adjoining balconies, which made me feel somewhat more secure than if it hadn't been. What did NOT make me feel secure was the doors that could be opened to connect my room to the adjoining room.  The door on my side did NOT lock securely - the deadbolt would only go a little way in instead of the whole way in, causing the door to be able to be opened with a good punch, kick or vibration.  Sure enough, a party of loud young guys showed up to stay in the room next door and opened the door on their side thinking probably it was a closet (same mistake I made initially).  The walls between our rooms were paper thin and I could clearly hear these bro's conversation, plus I could hear when they went out on the balcony and started yelling to their buddy down in the parking lot.  Fortunately they went out after that, and I didn't have much luggage with me, so I put my few valuables in the storage safe and went out to the show.  I thought about asking for a room change but I was on a tight schedule so I just decided to put up with it. I got home about 2:30 am and my door was still ""kinda locked"" and the next door room was quiet, so I went to sleep.  I woke up at 6:30 am to find that the door on my side of the room was open like it had been pushed or vibrated open.  The door to the next room was shut.  Nothing like my purse or money (all of which was out on the nightstand next to my bed) had been taken which made me think the door either vibrated open or the guys next door made a mistake again, realized it and then locked their door and left me alone, but it was scary, especially since some of the patrons of this hotel are kinda skeezy looking (though not all; there were some families with little kids, some budget-tourist couples and the like as well - basically a mix of what looks like budget/ family travelers and people who want a room to party all night).  I told the desk girl about the bad door lock and she seemed concerned and said she'd have someone fix it right away.   On the plus side, I had the mushroom ravioli from the restaurant for dinner.  It was reasonably tasty and came with some rolls and herbed honey butter that were REALLY tasty.  Better than what I expected from a place like this. Edited:  It's now a couple months down the road and the more I think about that situation with the door that didn't lock, the creepier I feel about what could have happened, especially given that some of the people staying at this particular hotel looked pretty dern ghetto, so in retrospect, I'm gonna knock it down a star.  I really can't recommend this place at all after an experience like that.",2,2,1,0,N,kLvaHkfKWrVXlWxpZ-ZWFg,Ashley R.,"Seattle, WA",September 2011,0,24,0,14,0,4,0,0,0,0.06060606060606061,jAW1qSJcbFfepqcPnBvGfg,Nisi Estiatorio,"Nisi Estiatorio - CLOSED - Englewood, NJ",26,4.0,"Restaurants, Salad, Mediterranean, Greek, METADATA","90 Grand Ave Englewood, NJ 07631",Yes,$$$,No,http://www.nisirestaurant.com,(201) 567-4700,0

The tile, the paint, the shower curtain, you needed sunglasses in there in the morning. *The towels are small, thin, and scratchy. *There were no towel racks or hooks to hang your wet towels. I thought it very strange, but on the other hand, the floor is fine since they'll bring you fresh ones anyway. *The air conditioner pumped out room temp air loudly and we were unable to adjust the temp or the level at all. Pretty sure the controls were just for looks. All in all, we have very fond memories of this place and plan on coming back next time we're in Chicago.",4,1,0,2,N,JY6IepgSDkESrtMl1GCD_Q,Patricia N stands for Nom Nom N.,"Union City, CA",September 2009,144,129,5,125,57,28,49,601,6,0.11456483126110124,GOLFLlO4bpndDkavbgrx9w,Paisano's Restaurant,"Paisano's Restaurant - Rutherford, NJ",70,4.0,"Restaurants, Italian, METADATA","132 Park Ave Rutherford, NJ 07070",Yes,$$,No,http://www.paisanos.com,(201) 935-5755,0

I'm tired and hungry, which causes me to start to get headache. Marriott asks for my name, so I can check in.  She then tells me...""Oh, you're not supposed to check in until tomorrow."" I'm thinking ""WTF, do you not see me here?""  Then proceeds to tell me there's no space available. She doesn't offer to help me find a new place.  Mind you this is my first time in Chicago and I have no idea where to stay. Luckily, my organizer just steps in from dinner.

My fiance and I went to a show at a club right down the street from the milshire........we drove 3 hours to see the concert, and wanted to stay the night, and didn't want to drive far to a hotel...... Well, we ended up going home anyway ater exoeriencing this hotel for only about 15 minutes.Absolutely disgusting. I knew it wasn't looking good as we were walking up the stairs to our room. It hadnt looked like the carpet ahd been vacuumed in months. There was a cigarette butt on the step. We paid 52$ for a private room, a single room means you pay 34$, but have to share a bathroom with your neighbor. Who the F@@@ wants to do that.This room was amaller than an efficiency apartment. There were missing tiles in the showers. It was dirty, filthy, and disgusting. The ceiling had a huge crack in it, with rust and paint chipping. There were two roaches in the drawers of the dresser. As i pulled back back the sheets to check them out, I saw cigarette burn holes and stains. THe plate that held a big cup for ice and plastic cups had cigarette burns on it also.The windows had paint chipping on them as well, with graffitti spray painted on two windows.This was the worst hotel I've ever seen. We did not stay the night. We wasted 52$ on some pig stye room. As we left I got the managers business card. i agree with a past review, this place is for hookers ands junkies.....and bums.....Really creepy atmosphere.I've stayed at the Dollar Inn before, and compared to this place, the Dollar Inn is a Hilton.  I don't understand how the Health Department hasn't been called on them. It is not sanitary whatsoever, how can a business be ran in the condition of this measure of nastiness.........I could go on and on about all the horrible things of this hotel, but i think ive said enough.Oh and I had to rate this hotel with at least one star, but it, in no way, deserves even one star......no stars for this place!!!!!!!

A real breakfast was included every morning, waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee and danish. The rooms have a fridge, microwave and a mini sink, The bathrooms are great. I was just more than impressed with my stay. The beds are a little on the firm side for me and it is my opinion and my skins opinion that they use a bit too much bleach on the linens.
