0;6/8/2011;MyNjnxzZVTPq;IFTr6_6NI4CgCVavIL9k5g;"Let me begin by saying that there are two kinds of people, those who will give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars and rave about it to everyone they know, or... people who can't get past the broken phone, blood stains, beeping fire alarms, peg-legged receptionist, lack of water pressure, cracked walls, strange smells, questionable elevator, televisions left to die after the digital conversion, and the possibility that the air conditioner may fall out the window at any moment. That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.";5;18;11;28;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg

2;6/26/2009;BfhqiyfC;CiwZ6S5ZizAFL5gypf8tLA;"I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me ""pre-homeless"". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me ""pre-unemployed"". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the ""Hotel Tokyo"". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.";5;12;14;23;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg

Pro:  It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs.

Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.";2;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an ""on"" setting and an ""off"" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel ""fitness center,"" the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.";3;3;0;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
8;10/26/2009;w;rIhwHyWLy4iyXOaqyqjJsw;"My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond ""charming"" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.";3;2;1;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills.  So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package.  Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per).  Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage.

The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!";4;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

At first, I was confused on the hotel: do I like it or hate it? The lobby is old fashioned in the sense with beautifully decorated with wooden crown moldings and leather sofa's. The receptionist didn't acknowledge us when we entered or exited, however, they were very attentive when I needed something. (IE: I wanted more towels & i got them in less than 5 minutes). The room was average, but very clean. At first, I was annoyed at how different the room looked in comparison to the photos, but my fiance made me change my mind: were we there to stay in a room the whole day or were we in Chicago to sight see? He was right: who cares? The best part: it was cheap ($85 a night) and walking distance to SO MANY attractions: a block away from million mile, short walk to the beach/Lake Michigan, 2 blocks from the Chicago Trolley, short walk to several bars and restaurants, to name a few. They also allowed me to receive and send faxes for free! For the price other hotels were charging, I would definately recommend this place!";4;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room.

""The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ...  its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me."" So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that.  Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for.  If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine.  So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room.  I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart.  Somewhere in the back/bottom...";1;0;0;1;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg

This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards.

The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring.

Our guests enjoyed staying there.  It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book.  My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding.  The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party.

It was intimate, people we're able to meet and talk.  Since we had a small party, everyone could fit comfortably into the large bar area. The food was from Philanders and it was awesome across the board- the fav main dish was the beef and tilapia. YUMMY! We received a complimentary room which worked out well, we used it as our home base. It was close to the reception area and was very well kept with a old fashioned flair. I'm very happy with how the reception turned out, I think the hotel is great for smaller weddings and is a wonderful place if you want to get away from the typical Holiday Inn reception. Our course it comes with a price tag, but it was worth it! One more side note for wheelchair users: I was concerned since a couple of the guests are wheelchair-bound and the hotel reception area is actually on a couple levels. The hotel isn't accessible with ramps throughout, but they have lifts throughout to accomodate even larger electric wheelchairs.

I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as ""artsy"". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only ""bad"" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite.

The comforters are pilling due to wear,  blankets old.  The pillows had yellow stains.  Furnishings look somewhat grungey on the surface, as though they haven't been wiped down properly.  The wallpaper and sofa had white stains.  The bathroom had mildew.   When the first room I had smelled of smoke (I have a severe smoke allergy), to the hotel's credit, I was (very nicely) given a second room without question.  While the smell of smoke in the second room was less, the room was no cleaner.  Both rooms hadn't been vacuumed well, and there was grit and dirt in the carpet.   In addition, a previous guest had spilled coffee grounds in one area, and no one had cleaned it up. I understand that due to the age of the building, that most funds must be put into the exterior, and keeping it up to code.  That being, said, for the money you are paying, I think the owners should seriously consider addressing some of these problems.";2;3;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms!

It markets itself as boutique hotel and it is indeed just that, so you can expect great 1:1 service but it's not going to be a systematic as your neighborhood Hilton. Maybe it's because I live in NY, but the room were much bigger than I anticipated and we had a great view of Chicago's Gold Coast. The beds were insanely comfortable and I found the bathroom to be clean (and also spacious). As I had last been to Chicago when I was a kid, I wasn't too familiar with what to do but found everyone at the front desk and concierge to be very helpful in recommending places to go visit/eat. I was initially unsure on how near/far the hotel was relative to other things in Chicago but quickly found its location to be very ideal. It's right off Michigan Ave so you have all the shopping/Maginificent Mile right there and only a few blocks away from the water. In fact, the only time we used a cab was to get to/from the airport and then coming back from going out at night. They do not have an ice machine on each floor so you have to call the front desk to order some which is fine with me but when we did call, we had to do so twice before it finally came up. A light bulb was out in our room and we also had to call twice before someone came. I am not sure if getting to the ice machine/mechanic just took that much time but that was only some significant ""complaint"" I had. Also, the TV was severaly outdated (think late 90's) and was angled to the left of our bed (opposed to in front) which was a little strange.

We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of a construction site, the Hancock building, and the American Girl doll shop. But for some reason, I can't get too into this place. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it lacked a decent screen on the 16th floor windows, paying $10/day for internet access (when I've had it free at plenty of others), the creepily trembling elevators, or that the staff were rude, but I just can't give this place five stars. However, despite those short comings, it was incredibly clean, the hotel is in a safe part of town, the beds are comfortable, and the drinks at the downstairs bar were fantastic.

The staff when I left was friendly. I was the staff in the middle I didn't really appreciate. I also didn't appreciate the ancient elevator or the fact that I did end up in a lovely penthouse with a view only to wake up in the morning and realize the shower didn't work.

ELEVATORS The elevators are small, very small.  Not a negative, since they move quickly.  I was very cramped when I was in there with 2 guys , a mom, her mom, and her kid.  Yikes, I was afraid the cables wouldn't hold.   CHECK IN/OUT The lobby is small, but the staff was very pleasant and welcoming!  I was pleased that we were able to check in early and check out late.  We checked in at noon and out at 1:00, huge plus!  They also kept our bags until we caught the train home later that day at 6.   STAFF Everyone that we had contact with was sweet and polite.  The consierge (sp???) was great!  Super helpful. RESTAURANT ON LOCATION Unless you got the Groupon that we did skip Mei Fornetto, it's not worth it for breakfast.  Pretty expensive.  We didn't eat there for any other meal.  The food we had was really good, though. ROOM Our room had a horrible view, but whatever, I could really care less.  I prefer to walk in it instead of just looking at it!  We had no issue with the shower at all.  We had no issue with hearing anyone around us.  The room was a little on the dark side.  The TV is in an odd location for watching TV in bed...until my husband figured out you can slide the doors in and pull the TV out.  Again, the beds totally rock.  Everything was clean.  I'm pretty leary about taking a bath in a hotel, but I did-several times and didn't worry about it at all.  I didn't like how we didn't have a coffee maker in the room.  I get up earlier than my husband and the first thing I like to do is have some coffee in my jammies.  I couldn't, unless I wanted to brave the lobby that way.  It also really pissed me off when they took the coffee away before 11 AM!!!  It's supposed to be out until then, but was taken away by 10:40 one of the mornings, grrr.  Don't mess with my coffee.  The coffee situation is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me.  The internet was included with our Groupon.  Had I paid for it I wouldn't have been to pleased, it was pretty sketchy.

My room had a sort of old charm.  I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early.  Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life.  But it was sufficient.

The location doesn't get much better.  You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance.  If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop.  Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy ""wired"" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did.  Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm.  So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead.  When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm.  Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90?  Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm.  I left at 4.";3;1;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

I thought I was supposed to be in a pinnacle king (which i booked on http://Hotels.com) and mentioned this to the lady who checked me in.  She told me ""yeah, you're in a superior king""  Only after I had unpacked all my stuff did I realize that there WAS a difference ( I thought maybe there were two names for the same room).  At that point, it wasn't worth calling to complain. Laid down to take a nap after I got into my room at 12:30.  Was woken up about an hour later by the lady who came to check the mini bar to see if the prior occupants had used anything.  Saw her doing the same two days later when I was leaving.  Why not do it when the room is being cleaned?    Still got charged for a Snickers i had to call and ask to be removed from my bill (I HATE snickers). At least twice when someone came to my room, I was in the bathroom, and heard them getting keys out to enter my room....had to hop off the toilet so they wouldn't find me in a compromising position. Last year thought the Whitehall was great.  This year....not so much.  These seem like system issues, not random issues that could happen to anyone. Stayed at the Whitehall a week for a conference. Pros:  Incredibly comfy beds and fine linens.  Large spacious room, considering it is an older hotel.  I had two queen beds, but there were also two sitting chairs with a table in between them.  Each bed had a bedside table.  Everything was well spread out, not cramped together.  Elevators were small, but fast (last year I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and routinely waited 5 minutes for an elevator, which irritated me).  Beautiful tile work in the bathroom.  Friendly, accomodating staff.  Lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom.  Close to Michigan Ave. Cons:  Small bathroom, although this is not unexpected given it is an older hotel.  No ice machines on the floors.  I really hated this.  Every time you want ice, you have to call room service.  Then I wasn't sure if I should tip for something I'd rather do myself anyways?  TV was old and of poor quality, and the movie channels (pay per view) didn't come in well.

82;9/11/2009;RTnNZv0nExodycq0O41jQQ;iSWsgppkv4dNyhDMGTpOJw;"After staying at a big hotel like the Hyatt, I really appreciated The Whitehall Hotel, and how quiet and cozy it is. Location, fabulous, a block away from the Hancock Observatory, and a few blocks away from Oak Street beach, and the red line. The room and bathroom were very nice (see pictures). Luis approved. Layout of room was OK, until I opened the drawers. The bed and drawers are too close to each other, if the drawers are open it blocks the path to walk to the other side of the room. I did not like this, it didn't make me feel fancy anymore. No nice view here. I don't know if I was just not lucky enough to get a nice view or if all rooms are like this. But since I didn't plan to look out the window that much, it didn't bother me. One more thing I will complain about is the temperature of the room. I don't know if it was me that didn't know how to work the thermostat thing or if It was set to a standard temperature. I love my room to be über cold, so I can sleep, and every time I would get back to my room after going out, it would be too hot for me. No likey my room warm. So I had to adjust it every time.  Annoying. The tv was pretty old too, a little upgrade and new furniture wouldn't hurt. Things I liked, were that it was quiet, it didn't feel like a mall, not a lot of people. Most of the time the elevator was not crowded, and it was fast. The service was very nice. The person at the front desk recommended me going to a nearby Internet cafe to use the computer instead of using the hotel's. That way I would get to use the Internet and get a nice cup of coffee instead of just spending my money at the hotel's business center. I thought that was nice of him. I stayed here for 4 days. I probably was that guy that came in at 2am every night, that someone commented earlier on their review, but I did not slam the door, the door makes a big noise when it locks. Sorry. Lol. Anyways. I loved coming back to my room and sleeping in that bed after a long night. I'd definitely stay here again. The things I complained about are no biggie, but if fixed they would get a 5 star.";4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

Cons:  It takes a bit for the staff to warm up to you.  They are brusque and professional, but it seems like you have to talk to them for several minutes before they start to be nice as well.  Also, it took the valet a long time to find my car.  Finally, about the re-model, I'd have liked them to follow through a bit more .

We were okay to hear this. When we got to our room...disappointed. The elevators are ghetto and old looking. The hallway to our room is dark and shabby looking. The cups in our room had finger prints all over them. The shower had mold in the caulk and in the corners. The caulking at the base of the tub and the floor was cracked and stained looking. The toilet was dirty looking. They do not have ice machines or a vending machine for snacks or a small hotel store. We needed some ice for drinks we bought to the room and they sent up a guy with an ice bucket. This guy was not professional at all. He came in with regular street clothes and he actually welcomed himself in the room without my okay for him to come in. The ice is from the chinese restaurant downstairs. There is nothing luxurious or hotel like about this place. It is as creepy as a run down motel. Checking out took us 15 minutes before the front desk guy even came to the front. He was very rude.

I travel a fair amount for twentysomething, and I was raised by a single mom without a ton of money to burn. So that's my perspective going into this. My mom was asked to come up to the city to have a corporate meeting and dinner with the suits afterwards. Since we're very close and I'll take any excuse to be in the city ('sup H&M and newly opened Topshop), she got the okay for me to come along. She was assured that the room was put on the company card and she wouldn't have to pay for it to be later reimbursed. She even got a printed confirmation of this, and the company card info. When we got there, this wasn't the case. I waited out front in the rain with the painfully friendly valet workers for a while and found out that they needed her to pay for the room after all, and it would only be straightened out once the corporate people got there. One of the employees wasn't too nice about it, and said that the refund could only be done by the manager the next morning. This was a lie, because a regular old employee did it anyway (still the next morning, however). The rooms are very spacious. There's a little kitchenette/minibar type situation (with no liquor, though, boo) with small appliances, a living room/office with a pullout couch, desk, chair, table, and a flatscreen. The bathroom is nice, and the shower has a tall showerhead (I'm almost six feet, rejoice). The bedroom is okay, with lots of pillows and another flatscreen. The brightness of the TVs auto adjusts to the light in the room, which I like. We were almost on the top floor, and when I was in my bed, I was looking right at the Hancock Building, which was across the street. WiFi costs $10 for 24 hours, which I did not see coming, and wasn't too happy about. Location is obviously fantastic, even if the closest train stop is slightly farther than convenient after a long day. If you can afford to stay here, you're probably not taking a train around town. At the end of the day, it was impressive in the ways it needs to be for its demographic. But for a college girl who knows the city like the back of her hand (read: just wants convenient trains to neighborhoods I care about, not to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and shop at Water Tower) and is used to free WiFi and breakfast in her hotel rooms, it left a few things to be desired.

We were very surprised at our room!  We loved that it was a suite with a frig and microwave.  It had a TV in the living room and bedroom.  We had a great view on the 24th floor, too.  For an even better view, go up to the pool on the 30th floor.  You can see for miles and miles up there!  My husband loved the Precor ellipticals in the fitness room. No free breakfast and even a Nutrigrain breakfast bar cost $2!  We didn't go to the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on that.   I would highly recommend this hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few downtown hotels!";4;1;0;0;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw

Couldnt get out of the bed in the a.m. LOVED my room on the 10th floor. -On the 10th floor, the shutters opened to a view of downtown -Most of the staff was really nice! -Lobby/Bar area is really cute -FREE Wi-fi   Cons -My friend didnt specify a preference and ended up on a smoking (4th) floor. The hotel was completely booked so she couldnt change. As soon as the elevator opened on her floor it reeked of smoke. Im not a smoker so it was completely suffocating for me when i visited her room for 5mins. She stayed 3nights and was completely miserable. (MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY) -The lady w/ the long dark hair was rude. -Ordered room service (the croissant sandwich) for bfast and it was absolutely horrible. Bacon tasted like rubber..Couldnt finish it.. -Cabs rarely come in front of the hotel so you'll need to walk down the block to Division (not far.. just inconvenient) to catch one. -Several bars, a Starbucks, & Walgreens in the area but not many good food choices... we cabbed it to other areas.";3;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

And speaking of coasts, this place had an uncanny resemblance to Alexander's Guesthouse on Key West. Hotel Indigo was VERY beachy, but also quite classy. Backwards script discussed ""phi"" along the walls (luckily, I can read backwards), which I thought looked cool but was weird (why was it backwards?). We approached the counter and the two men stayed near the back and glanced at us with a silent question in their facial expressions. ""Can we check in?"" That's when they jumped to attention. Weird that they didn't make the first move. The entry area to our room was the best. There was a small foyer area with a long table and mirror. To the right was our bathroom and the bedroom was to the left. The floors were ""wooden,"" and the walls were a pretty periwinkle with green accents. One wall had enlarged pictures of mussles. The view from our window was to a fire-escape with a brick wall beyond (not the beach I expected). Other things to note: - Aveda soaps/lotions/shampoo - comfortable bed - tube tv - unpopulated bar - breakfast place also seemed unpopular (there's a great breakfast place just two doors north of the hotel) - free wifi - we could hear other guests down the hall, but not loud enough to be bothersome";4;6;1;2;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
124;7/17/2011;ozz0pw1L9cjo8q6QVyifXQ;HF96EkVqJeSPTU-mMzJfow;"I needed a place to stay after moving out of my apartment on my way out of town for a new job.  I lived less than a block away from the Hotel Indigo, and with the Ambassador East under renovation, it was really the only choice in my neighborhood. The normal rates for this place are nuts - $180/night.  If you use Hotwire or Priceline you pay at least half that, but keep in mind you lose the ability to choose your bed type or smoking/non-smoking preferences.  I was placed in a smoking room - at the front desk, they cheerfully told me I could ""upgrade"" to a non-smoking room for $75/night (which basically nullifies the rate I found on Hotwire), and when I showed no interest in that, they brought it down to $40.  Since all I really needed was a bed, and a place to bathe, it wasn't the end of the world, and I declined all their upgrade offers. My room faintly smelled of cigarette smoke, and I could barely even notice it.  The hallway, on the other hand, had a noticeable odor.  Thankfully my room was near the elevators so I was exposed to that for only a few seconds. The room was adequate... I wouldn't define it as tiny but it might feel that way if two people were in the room.  The seashore motif was not that annoying.  The bed, however, was on wheels, and would start rolling away from the headboard (wall-mounted) which was very cumbersome.  Also, a large wooden tray with glasses and an ice bucket is on the bed and there really isn't any convenient place to put it when you're ready to lie down. In terms of other room features: the TV was dated (LodgeNet?  I had to laugh at the welcome screen's voice-over actress: Canadian - ""Welcome to Chicag-OH, and thank you for staying at Hootel Indig-OH"")  but I definitely enjoyed the Keurig coffee brewer, with a cup of tea at night before bed and a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  The bathroom was only a shower, with a strange showerhead that I eventually figured out, however all the fixtures were new, and the Aveda bath and body products were a nice touch.  The front desk staff were smart enough to give me the WiFi password when I checked in - I always hate getting to my room, pulling out my laptop, and having to call the desk to get the password. That said, the only problem I really had was with the lack of bellhops.  Normally I wouldn't need any help with my luggage, but since I was moving I had six pieces of luggage.  When I arrived, they didn't have anyone available immediately.  I waited about 15 minutes.  (The nice gentleman at the front desk literally had an aneurysm calling for assistance on the radio multiple times.)  The morning I left, I called early and gave them a half-hour's notice that I needed some help.  Nobody showed and I had to take care of everything myself - I was taking an airport shuttle and couldn't risk missing it. All in all, it was a decent place to stay, but just remember, if you book through a discounted booking site, you're not going to get a lot of options from this place.";3;2;0;1;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

Just take Division and it takes you right to the beach.

First, I have to say that this is a good hotel for a weekend getaway but I would not reccomend it for a long extended stay, since there is no closet space. I loved the lobby, it had a modern pallete and is scented based on the season. The scent was pineapple for the summer and it was just so refreshing. The front desk staff always remembered us and always said hello to us, which is a nice change from large chain hotels. The room itself is cozy, but I loved the king size bed and the great comforter that was on it. Also Aveda bath products were a plus. The few cons I have are the shower curtain never seemed to keep the water out. They really should just put a shower door. The air conditioner was either really cold or not cold enough and it was a bit noisy. The ice machine is on the 2nd floor and when I went, it was out of ice. I called and they brought me a HUGE bag of ice (way more than any one person could consume, so I had to put it in my sink), but they were quick in bringing it. Last, we said we were staying for our anniversary and they really didn't do anything for us. I don't expect anything, but always give props to hotels that go the one up.

I will start out with the good: - Beds are super soft - Wireless was fast and had a good connection - Close to Clinton Blue line Now the bad: Before taking a shower, I noticed that there was shampoo, and two bottles of lotion. My companion called the front desk to get some conditioner thinking the maid just mixed up the bottles because they look similar. Within minutes (good) a man was at our delivering four bottles. However, upon inspection we saw that it was two shampoos and two lotions. We were a bit mystified and wondering if you could use lotion for conditioner all rational thought says no, so we called the front desk again proposing the question. Her response was rather rude as she stated lotion was lotion not conditioner.   Next, the walls are thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway as well as the neighbors coming back in their drunken stupor at 4 am. Not to mention because the hotel is located close to the interstate and subway, there is a lot of noise at night. The hotel parking is not free. There is a $35/day charge but you can get it for $25 if you sign up for something for free. There is a parking lot located below that you can pay per day but it was very sketchy. As we were walking to the subway, three men were hanging in the area and yelled very rude comments and six hours later when we returned they were still there.

I stayed at this Holiday Inn because they were the only downtown hotel I could find that had a room and parking package that was within my per diem, and that will be the only reason I ever stay here again.";3;3;0;1;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA
144;8/20/2010;m8Z8;L3yDKTulyxiL_SOL40uzpw;"I will NEVER ever use travelocity's secret hotel application even if my life depended on it! Travelocity rated this hotel with 4/5 stars, which is pretty high since other hotels such as Inn of Chicago, Allerton, Drake, etc are also rated 4/5 or higher. The lobby was very VERY tiny and full of kids running around. The front desk personnel was helpful and friendly; she was very helpful and answered all the questions I had. I had booked a ""secret"" room through travelocity and luckily it ended up being a king. Upon entering my room, I noticed it smelled like wet towels that have been laying there for days. The room was rather small and the lights flickered. The bathroom took up 1/3 of the entire room! There were weird stains in the bathtub and the towels smelled like straight up bleach. There was a giant crack in the wall near the window (EEEEK!!!) Usually at other hotels, you can control the temperature in your own room. Not this hotel apparently. The AC kicks on whenever it feels like and every time it does, its so loud that your forced awake. It usually turns off by itself after a few minutes to let you fall asleep and then the cycle begins again! I paid an extra $30 a day for valet parking. To be honest, I was rather surprised this place offered that service to the guests. However when I asked for my car, the valet just simply handed me the key. I paid $30 for them to HAND me my key??? To make matters worse, it took me 30 minutes to find a cab in downtown Chicago around that area. The next morning, I woke up to what sounded like construction drilling. I checked out VERY early. I checked online and apparently, a room at this hotel for the night will cost you around $185!!! I only paid $75, but had I known, I would have gladly paid the $150 to be on Michigan Avenue. Overall, this place was a mess. I did like the customer service at the front desk; they were very polite and helpful. Other than that, the entire hotel is a giant dump that is not even worth 2 stars let alone 4/5!";1;1;0;0;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA

The location isn't dreadful, but it certainly isn't close to anything.  There's a Panera, Whole Foods, etc about a 6 block walk, but in January winter and 5"" of snow, count me out.  If you have a car, then life is good, otherwise plan on taking a cab to everything. Great fitness center on the top floor, all health club quality Precor equipment, a great multi-machine, and dumbbells up to 50lbs.  Kudos to the General Manager for making the investment here. Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need.  I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I see other reviews talking about the tiny lobby.  I use the lobby for checkin and checkout and don't hang out there, so it's small size doesn't bother me.  I did not experience the families, although I'm also not here during the high season. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window.  If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade.  Find out whatever the Crowne Plaza on Huron has, and make the investment into the same pipe.  It would also be nice to have coffee in the lobby.

I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable. There were 2 big TVs with a great range of channels - yup, I was stuck on the Food channel most of the time. Seneca was a bargain for this part of town";4;11;11;8;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

149;7/18/2008;a1AIpxn2OXX48s9RTmVr7g;wwNs_kMiVEn8V61uqP3ZzA;"Rate, location, security and staff were better than the vast majority of hotels I've stayed - which is bunches - I travel for business A LOT. For those that base their vacations on room decor, we may not see eye to eye. I couldn't care less about it, but to describe the room best I'd say  the decor was far from cutting edge (just shy of tacky yet nondescript), the room itself was big and comfortable. It could use new carpet and updated bedding but it had a nice desk, couch, king bed, 3 closets (seemed odd, but whatever) and a kitchenette that was really cutely tucked away within the room. I was very surprised to find a full size fridge, small sized stovetop oven (not that I needed it, but if I were coming over from Europe or anywhere else I'd be very psyched for that as a bonus). We did hear about other people with air conditioning issues with their room; we were totally uneffected. Just in case the room influences that, #1012 is a safe bet. At 129/night, I felt it was a bit of a gamble given this hotel's prime location literally behind the Hancock and kitty corner from Water Tower. You could practically throw a rock at either. I'm originally from Chicago and recently moved out east and was back on business for a week. Trust me, hotels in that location cost at least double. People who live on that block spend more money on their dogs than I will make in my lifetime. This hotel is easily 100/night less than counterparts in this neighborhood. Shopping is pinnacle Michigan Ave, and Oak Street beach is easily walked (a couple blocks). A few things you might not know (if you aren't from there): A neat place to grab a drink is the Hancock. Instead of the observation deck, go up for a cocktail and have the same view while having a nip. Also, on the 600 N. block of St. Clair (about 3 blocks South) is a great little italian place called Coco Pazzo Cafe. Reasonable prices, outdoor seating and outstanding food. If you ask the concierge about it, be sure they direct you to the St. Clair location and not Hubbard (though I'm sure it's just as good, it's not within walking distance). Two more things! Something that really caught me was the security. Nowhere that I've stayed in Chicago has had key entrances near the elevator bank. I thought this feature was a cupcake. Something all the downtown hotels should have everywhere! It gave me an extra bonus sense of security. Lastly, the staff was super friendly and efficient. We left the ""do not disturb"" sign on our room when we went out for the day and when we got back to the room we had a message on our phone from the head of the cleaning staff letting us know, in the most pleasant tone ever, that they had not cleaned our room so as not to disturb us and to call them if we needed anything(!). In fact, from arrival at the valet, through checkin and at checkout, all staff members were just that - super friendly, and most importantly, efficient. I agree with another reviewer that said this hotel was neither romantic nor trendy, but if you're looking for an attentive, quality hotel experience while adventuring into Chicago (especially if you're interested in the ""mag mile""), don't hesitate.";4;3;1;1;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

They were friendly and always promptly responded if I needed assistance (like extra coffee or an ironing board). I felt COMPLETELY safe in the hotel and in the surrounding proximity. The hotel is half a block from Lake Michigan and Buckingham Fountain. It's close to the red line, major cta bus routes, and Lou Malnati's pizza.

I was searching for a hotel in the downtown area for my trip to Chicago and Expedia threw up this Travelodge which was almost in the heart of downtown and good subway connections. With such a great location, they should be trying to make the best of it but instead, this hotel seems to have given up competely with any other effort to create a good hotel experience. This started off at check in when they observed the 3pm check in time to the minute. Any classy hotel chain would allow some leeway if the rooms are ready. So there was a huge queue of disgruntled customers all piled up at the desk at 3pm. There seemed to be little effort by the staff to appear helpful or particularly friendly. The room was adequate in a hostel standard type of way. In a way, it was good beause it forced me to get out and explore Chicago more althought I was feeling tired and jetlagged.

I did not freak out till I found that my room's door was not locking at all. I had already left my valuables and gone out running once before I realized it. And I when I realized it, I was on my way for an appointment. When it became clear that I had to choose between leaving my door wide ajar as the handyman fixed it and being 1.5 hours late for my appointment I had just had enough.

What I cannot handle is elevators that do not run properly, are extremely stuffy and slow, and GET STUCK, requiring you to press the call button to be rescued from the elevator by the maintenance crew. This hotel has 2 modern elevators and 1 manual elevator. Why they still have a manual elevator is beyond me, but thank god for that thing because during my stay only 1 of the modern elevators was ever running, and when we got stuck in it the manual elevator aided in our rescue mission. Only staff can run the manual lift, so that meant that all guests across 12 floors were using 1 elevator. This created a big hassle and long waits to get to and from your room (we were on the 12th floor - stairs not really an option). I also just did not feel safe in the elevators. The location is great, staff are nice and competent (expect for the housekeeper - she was rudeness to the max), wi-fi is free, and luckily our room was quiet. But the furnishings are very cheap and outdated. The double beds are just doubles, not queen size. And housekeeping would only give us 1 roll of toilet paper at a time. We had 4 people in the room! Needless to say we ran out of toilet paper each day of our stay. Also, we had a suite with a ""kitchenette,"" but there was really nothing that you could do in this kitchenette other than store leftovers in the fridge, heat them up in the microwave, and then eat them with your bare hands. There was no silverware, plates, glasses, nothing - just some paper cups. So if you want to take advantage of the ""kitchenette"" you'll have to bring the same type of gear you'd bring on a picnic.

Despite the strike, which apparently has been going for a while (their strike signs looked worn)  the place is operating, but not fully.  There was an escalator going up to the hall that did not work.  There were toilets that did not work and were covered with plastic.  You could tell these items had been not functioning a while.  The place could have been cleaner, maybe it just needed some paint.  The food at the reception was ok, but even in the dimmed lights you could see that even the mashed potatoes had been made carelessly: they were dark and oxidized.   Just a small careless error, a detail, but it was another piece in the puzzle. They could have tried harder. Congress neglects  their building the details and apparently their employees too.

I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms.  I'd booked one of their ""junior suites,"" which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette.  Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment.  The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings.  The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall!  I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer.  The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room.  I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there.  I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.";4;0;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

And yes, I am giving them 5 stars.  I know, I know!  It's not a luxury hotel like the Ritz or Four Season, but for a nice, newer hotel in the area that caters more towards a business crowd, it is one of the best I've been to.

Upon arrival (at the self proclaimed 3 star hotel) I was disappointed to find that it was in a not-so-nice part of town. However, I quickly got over the fact because all I was looking for was a bed to sleep on. When I got to my room, changed, and left to grab food, I noticed the door to my hotel room would not lock from the outside. I called the front desk and asked to either be switched to another room or to have someone come fix it. Unfortunately, the handy man didn't arrive until 11:30... which meant I was sitting in my room, awake, foodless, waiting for him to arrive. After he came it took him an hour to fix my door. I wrote an angry letter to hotel management the next day and got the room comped for the night. However, I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to sleep very well, which definitely affected my performance at work the next day.

Aside from its location, SLH is also less than satisfactory.  SLH doesn't promise alot of amenities on their website, but they didn't carry through on some of the things that they did state.  The most annoying of these was their lack of internet access.  According to their website, they have net access, but neither room or business center access existed.   Also, the walls were pretty thin, but this was tempered by the fact that not many guests were staying there.  The west side of the hotel is backed up to the El and the windows did little to reduce the passing train cars' noise.  Over time the El started to sound like a waterfall or a river, not the most bothersome of sounds.  Even their television channel selection was poor.  There are more disappointing things to mention, but the aforementioned are more than enough things to help you make an informed hotel decision.  The only service that was good was their housekeeping staff.  They did a lot of stuff for us that wasn't prompted and asked for, but ended up being really useful for us.   After a couple of days, we moved on to better digs.  While my review may make SLH sound like the worst hotel ever, it's just that I've definitely experienced much better.  If you have a conference coming up and you want to save some dollars on a bare bones hotel, this can fit your bill.  I definitely would not endorse staying here on their regular price.  Get a reservation on Hotwire or something similar.  That way, you can live with yourself for choosing the CSLH.";2;3;2;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Let's talk about the ""services"" that are on their webpage: Continental Breakfast: No sight of it! Day Spa Services: Where? 24 Hour Fitness Center: There's a room with a treadmill and an exercise cycle. Gourmet Coffee Shop: ... There's a place that serves coffee.  Their hours are awful (and disagree with what they post), and the food isn't ""gourmet"" at all.  It's mostly packaged stuff they heat up for you at a premium.  Oh, and if you have any questions about it, the staff will gladly tell you that the coffee shop is a separate company and they have no idea about it. Gift Shoppe / Art Gallery: Worse hours than the coffee shop.  I've been here for three days, and I haven't seen it open yet. Meeting & Banquet Facilities: no idea. 24 Hour Business Center & Free Wi-Fi: There's a room with some computers and some printers.  The wi-fi is free, when it's working.  Unfortunately the staff know less about it than they do the coffee shop, and can only suggest using an ethernet cable (which they will provide, also free) if you have any problems. Limousine Services: They have the number for a limo company up front, yes. Wedding and Tour Packages: I've got nothing. Ample Parking: True.  This is because the place is abandoned, you and the other guest at the hotel have your choice of many spaces. Along with all of that, the staff seem like they're just off their game.  None of the rooms (I've unfortunately seen more than one) are well cleaned, and the hallways and common areas (except for the lobby) are in worse shape than the rooms.  It looks like there's been a fresh coat of paint by someone who lost interest before they finished (areas where the paint just... stops...). At the rate they're charging (~$140/night with tax), there's no way this is worth it.  At the hotwire rate ($60/night including tax), well, it's better. Finally, the area of town it's in is kind of sketchy.  It's close to Chinatown, and I expected to walk there for food and whatnot.  The staff strongly advised me against making that walk in the evenings or night time.  I did once at night, a bunch of times during the day, and it was fine.  However, I'm a large dude, and others might be less comfortable with it.  Once you get into Chinatown it's fine, but between here and there is a bit shady. I get the feeling that this hotel just isn't doing well enough to survive.  I overheard the staff saying that they had something like 50 rooms full this weekend.  That's close to 1/5 full.  Ouch...";2;6;1;3;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

If you stay here make sure to get your reservation on http://hotels.com or Travelocity or what ever your favorite travel site is.  It will be cheaper than calling them.  I called just to ask about getting the same price they said they couldn't which I found odd.  But hey what ever floats their boat.  The price was very good for staying in Chicago plus free parking.  Our tab was $82 a night. It was near china town which was great because I love chinese food.  Plus it was only like a 10 min walk to the red line which I used during my whole trip.";3;2;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
233;8/2/2009;XnI2xKMUAkYcW5XSTyBSKg;0CPgZHlqXUg013MJ9tZMiw;"This hotel is located in a total wasteland in the middle of nowhere. There are vacant lots on three out of four sides. There are no businesses  within walking distance in any direction. There is no pedestrian traffic outside at any hour. If you don't believe us, check out Google Street View for this block. It gives you a VERY accurate sense of what this neighborhood is like. The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work.  Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi.  Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, ""I'm not IT and it's a free service."" At $109/night (still overpriced ""discount"" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered ""free""; I mean, the bed was free too, right?  Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning. When we sent them away so that we could get dressed before they did up the room, they never came back and consequently we had to do without towels that day. There was such a disconnect between what we experienced with this hotel and what we'd read in some of the reviews that we wondered if maybe people had gotten it confused with some other hotel. The best thing about this hotel by far is the parking. The parking is free and convenient. There are pretty much always spots available. Other than that...";2;4;0;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

I booked over the phone for him, and I have the gentlemen at the front desk the salesmen's contact information should the need arise. He briefly told me the times of check-in, but I didn't note them as being anything unusual. Come to find out, check-in here is between the hours of 3pm and 6pm EXPRESSLY. If you don't check in during those times, they lock the doors and their system cancels your reservation. My salesman's flight didn't even get in until 8pm, so color him surprised when he shows up to a darkened porch and a locked door. Jorge, the manager on-site came to open the door after a certain amount of noise was made and let him in begrudgingly. He told him he was late and that they assumed he wasn't coming. They couldn't call to check? To make matters worse, on my salesmans 3rd day, he returned to the hotel to find Jorge waiting for him with bad news. Because he checked in late and his reservation was cancelled, they had double-booked the room. The couple waiting to check-in to his room was currently waiting in the bar. He was given 20 minutes to pack and get out. When he asked Jorge to call him a cab, Jorge told him that cabs don't come to that area and that he would have to walk four blocks to catch a cab or a bus. HONESTLY! My salesman is a better person than I as he handled it with grace, but I am furious over the way he was treated and how the situation was handled. It's a shame too, because the space is gorgeous and we would probably use it again if it weren't for the ludicrous business habits of the staff. Stay away unless you plan to play by their crazy rules and pay their crazy prices.";1;4;0;1;gAZVMESj-7Va8zntfZCvNQ

What the Manager's Reception is, is a 2-hour Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 P.M. With a hotel key, hotel guests have unlimited alcohol beverages at no cost from 5:30-7:30 P.M. plus snacks. The alcohol drinks range from draft Budweiser to Bahama Mamas and Blue Hawaiins (my favorite). All drinks are served by personable bar tenders. And not only are there drinks, there are  snacks. My favorite is the tri-color tortilla chips with salsa (served on certain days).  I rate the Manager Reception 5 stars. If you are having a bad day, by two hours the Manager's Reception should change your bad day into a great night.";5;1;0;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

Otherwise, this hotel was a great deal for all of the perks they offer and somewhere I'd definitely stay again, especially for a girl's night or weekend.";4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
240;9/16/2012;9HP;DdkiQ8aJO68OotgjH5bgvw;"First off about my perspective in reviewing this hotel.  I love value and convenience.  I hate lines and crowds.  I am also a fan of Embassy Suites, so I am taking into consideration my stays at other E.S. properties. We stayed here for the final two nights of our family vacation trip, and I picked this hotel for its central location in downtown Chicago, the free breakfast, and the overall price / value compared to other nice hotels in the area. When we arrived it was a little confusing.  After parking in the public parking garage (E.S. does not have its own parking, although you can do valet), and taking the elevator to the Embassy Suites / street level.  Around the corner was the bell / valet counter, and then around the corner from that was another elevator to take up to the lobby level.  Although the atrium is huge, the front desk area is actual somewhat cramped when waiting in a long line to check-in.  Finally, 20-25 minutes after parking we were able to take the third elevator ride up to the room.   The room itself  was spacious and comfortable , with a set-up typical of an Embassy Suites.  It is a huge hotel with a vast atrium in the middle.  Overall this is a nice property.   One of my favorite things about Embassy Suites is the free, made to order breakfast, however, the first morning, going down to breakfast, I was frustrated to see a massive line for the made to order.  So I decided to forego it and just do the buffet.  There was a good selection and the food was fine, although finding a table was a challenge.  My oldest son did wait in line for a omelet -- took over 20 minutes.  The next morning I made it a point to get up early; the line was shorter, but still almost took 15 minutes.  Interesting, also, the helper asked about what sides you wanted, and put them on a plate before the omelet was started, so they were cold before the omelet was finished.  Along the same lines, we went down for the evening reception, and the line for drinks was just as bad as the omelet line  -- not worth it to me, considering the idea of having a drink is to relax -- waiting in line for 15 minutes is not relaxing.  Perhaps the hotel is too big for every thing Embassy Suites promises. A couple other things.  I will never understand why I can pay $59 at a Super 8 and get free wi-fi, but a $250 hotel needs to charge $15 / day -- not per room, but per device (we decided internet could wait).  Also, we heard voices from other rooms while in our room. Overall, the stay was fine, but for what we paid, I did not consider it a great value.";3;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
241;3/11/2012;bNoFDguT9BdIrDb1TxsEcg;Mt31ShDTsvPfjKoTsFJmbQ;"I have stayed here a few times and my experience has been mixed. On the plus side, the hotel has a gorgeous lobby, with great views of the city around it.  It feels bright and open, much more so than most cookie cutter Embassy Suites. The rooms (suites) are nice and standard, and staff has been courteous and helpful on all occasions.  The pool that is right off the lobby is nice, as is the jacuzzi. On the minus side, the lines for breakfast can be atrocious, especially on weekend mornings when families stay at the hotel.  I am talking about 20 or 30 minutes buffet lines - forget about ordering a custom breakfast.  You really need to be there at 7 AM to avoid the lines, but that means you need to alter your schedule to account for the hotel's inability to handle a crowd.  The same is true of the evening reception - lines of 15, 20, 30 people to order a drink - frustrating. So I can recommend the hotel, but if the complimentary amenities are a reason for choosing this hotel, be prepared to dedicate extra time.";3;3;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

245;6/25/2012;0AqtWHFZIaVGylR69wuxXA;LxPE1kW-kkYr_PcpZKl9jQ;"Nice hotel with big comfortable rooms.  Parking is really expensive (~$44 per day to self-park w/o in-and-out priv., ~$53 to valet w/in-and-out priv.), but not out of the ordinary for the area.  The hotel begins on the 5th floor of the building, where the Sky Lobby is located.  Rooms go up onto the higher floors from there.  So, from the street, you should expect 2 elevator rides and a walk across the Sky Lobby no matter where your room is.  The location is very good, near the river, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive, Tribune Tower, NBC Tower, and the Chicago Loop.  They are well within walking distance to most of those places and plenty to do (plus, plenty of places to eat).  I did not take advantage of the bar, the manager's reception, or the breakfast.  However, the breakfast did look pretty busy, so keep that in mind as you read other reviews mentioning it. My only real complaint about the hotel is their keys.  If you insert and remove the key too fast or too slow, it won't work.  It's hard to gauge exactly how to do it right, consistently.  I heard others complain about this, too, on the elevator.  After a long day, when you're really tired, the last thing you want to have to do is fight with your room key.   Other than that, highly recommended.";4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The atrium in the middle of the hotel brings in a lot of light and the glass railings are both cool and scary!  The extras that they throw in are what made me love my 3-day stay.  Free breakfast buffet, free happy hour from 5-7, a free US weekly newspaper at your door in the morning, and really nice Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos and soaps (this seems basic, but lots of hotels don't give you free shampoos anymore). Oh and they have an internet room that has free printing so you can check-in to your flights or check email.  All of this for less than what I paid for a single room at the Sheraton which was decent, but nothing special.  (No free anything at Sheraton!  Not even good soap!)   I have to admit I didn't have the breakfast here as I was too busy, but the fact that it is offered is a total plus in my book!  Yes there were lots of people in line during breakfast, but I asked a couple how the food was and they said the make your own omelets and fresh fruits were good.   The bell hops and valets downstairs are also curteous and friendly.  They will help you with your bags or get you a cab in a second.   One tip -- get your hotel on http://priceline.com for the best deal ever!";5;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory. Although we weren't directly located next to anything, it worked out perfect to me in close to everything rather than closer to some places than other. Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. (Time varies by the day) - Made to order omelets of your choice. - Complimentary happy hour w/ chips & salsa and other snacks. - The nicest bellperson(s). Greeted everyday entering and leaving.

The hotel valet enterance is easily missed (on a one way street), but made it in the 2nd loop. Also the valet area is very crowded with people checking in and out, as well as cabbies. We waited for a few minutes before we could pull in. (Our car blocked the drive during check out, but we were prepared to load up and go. So only about a 3 minute hold up...) Upon checking in, the car was moved safely into a heated garage space by the valet (yes we snuck out and checked later). The hotel registration is up the elevators to the right. After we cheked in, we went up to our floor, and was welcomed by a grand view (see posted picures to see what I am talking about.) Already mentioned in a lot of other reviews, but... 1) Cooked-To-Order Breakfast (6:30am - 9:00am) is basically a tailored omlette your choices of spinach, chedder cheese, ham, bacon, jalapenos, peppers, onions, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. I just went for everything! 2) Managers reception (from 5:30 till 7:30pm) is basically free drinks and appetizers (chips and fries). A nice perk. 3) The room has a bedroom with either two full or one king (we stayed at the one king room suite) and a door that separates into the living room with a pull out sofa bed. (I heard that it was on the stiff side, but hey I didn't have to sleep in it.) 4) Pool, gym and sauna (6:00am till midnight) are available for people who want to work out. I went for couple laps at the pool, and used the sauna. Very refreshing in the morning. 5) Walking distance to main shopping area of town (i.e. Michigan Ave.). 6) Navy pier is two blocks from this place.

The biggest thing I didn't like was the check out time was 11 am.  Way too early in my opinion.  Also, the check in time was 4 pm.. a little too late.  But they have a great concierge service to leave your luggage with them.";5;0;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

Still, I guess I have a thing with them because I feel like there's a cost you pay for having a suite and having free breakfast. The workout room is slightly above average, the breakfast is pretty good and the staff is quite friendly. Big negative in getting a smoking room, though I didn't mind that much since it didn't smell. Also, negatives for not recognizing my status (yeah, I have it so I'm officially that guy) and for making me pay for the internet. The manager's special is a nice touch, though you only get well drinks and draft beers. The food is slightly edible.

However there was NOTHING fancy about the room, it was the exact one you get at a Country Inn & Suites suite for a lot less. It was weird to have to take an elevator to the lobby, then another to the room. There were kids everywhere. Too many kids, you would think there was a water park in it or something. I'm a Mom myself but this was a kid-free (our own at least) girls trip with 4 of my friends (we all fit in the room fine btw) and I wasn't in the mood to deal with apparently orphaned kids running amok, with parents nowhere in sight. A group of 4 or 5 kids decided to sit on the floor in the hallway  in front of their room 2 doors down from us and hang out. At 10:30 p.m. We went to use the Jacuzzi, it it was full of..you guessed it, kids. More like teenagers but still kids! Also at 10:30 p.m. I called the front desk, who said they would call security and make them leave since kids weren't supposed to be in there. Went back down and there they were. UGH! We never did get to use it, or the narrow tiny pool (also brat filled) Waited FOREVER to get a drink at the manager's reception (didn't mind though since we brought our own drinks from the room, and by the time we got to the front they had been drank.) The drinks were gross, my friends' apple martini was disgusting! And I have never been known to turn one down. I slept through breakfast but my friends said it was good.

I think it was the time frame we were there but the hotel seemed to have a lot of families.  Nothing wrong with that, just take it as a comment.  I'm more used to staying in hotels that were more business people or couples.  When you add in a bunch of children it changes the dynamics a bit. Breakfast -- Crowded but seemed to work itself out.  You either went early or went last minute.  If you wanted the ""made to order"" then you would need to be there early (tips are accepted).  The cook was amazing.  Also amazing were the people who cleaned up after the hordes.  These folks kept tables cleaned and new people got tables. The food was broken into three areas.  Made to order, hot dishes (eggs, bacon, pancakes) and then continental breakfast. Kudos to Oscar -- always had a smile and kept tables moving... Rooms - Ours had a comfy bed and the rest of the furniture was a hodge-podge.  The televisions had a limited number of channels and the only pay per view worth watching was ""The Kings Speech"", but why spend time in the room.  There was a fridge and a small microwave.  You will have to borrow some plates/silverware for your food. Dominicks is across the street so you can get food from there if you really need it. Evening food/drinks -- yep, it's there.  Nothing to go nuts over (no pun intended).  Small drinks (beer, wine) and some mixed drinks.  You save a little with not going to a bar but it depends what you like.  Munchies were of the nuts, salsa/chips variety. Noise -- even with the noise of the families your room isn't that bad.  Yes you can hear them next door but if they aren't the party type then all is good.  Put the TV up a little. Elevators -- very fast Internet - go across the street to Dominicks or down the street to Panera Bread and use theirs.  Also there is a business center on the ballroom floor that you can hook at cat5 cable into and not use the wireless but it is a small room. Workers there were very very nice -- even with the rude tourists.  I never saw them lose control.  Even the mother who dumped orange juice all over the place and proceeded to yell at everyone.  They cleaned it up and kept things moving.  I like the people there.

Grocery store across the street was cool for getting stuff to put in room and a Walgreens a block away. On the negative side: It was crawling with little kiddies of which one we heard crying at night through our room walls (very thin walls I think), the room had no safe or makeup mirror, it had a sink in the bedroom which I thought was rather odd, it took a hella long time for them to bring our bags up after we checked in, they say it takes 20mins to get your car out of valet and for you to call well in advance, OMG you could hear the drunks at the atrium bar at night even with our tv on (the sound just echoed up 10 floors), front desk only had 1-2 people working it at any given time and the concierge was not very helpful or friendly when she was there - which wasn't often, this was the first ES we've been to where they had signs up in the elevators telling you what times breakfast would be more crowded than others, and let me tell you about that!!! Made to order breakfast often had a long line unless you hit it just right and all I saw people get were omelette's and bacon, sausage, and potatoes.  Breakfast was THE SAME everyday!  Two buffet lines with eggs that looked and tasted like powdered eggs, bacon and sausage links, pancakes, and yogurt.  Also watery oatmeal, 3 dried cereals, lots of donuts, and toast and English muffins.  One buffet line had food that was always not warm and you only got orange or apple juice as your choices.  The managers reception in evening was alright. Cell phone reception was zip in our room and valet parking with in and out privileges was 49$ but self park without in and out was 42$.";2;0;0;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night.

An extremely rude manager came up and told us that we were being too loud, he could hear us downstairs, and that there had been 2 complaints. If there was a 3rd complaint, we would have to leave the hotel, which we should have done anyway. First of all, 2 of our friends were resting in the bedroom because they had headaches and barely heard us. We were on the 5th floor. So if they could hear us in the lobby, the construction must be outrageously poor. 5 minutes later, they sent a cop up, who was actually very pleasant. But really, a cop?

The rules sign says children under 14 are not permitted but both times we tried to visit it there were children. The first time a mom brought 4 young children in who were splashing around and knocking into me and my boyfriend. I mentioned to her that children weren't allowed but she didn't do anything. I told the front desk as we were leaving that day. The next time I noticed it before we got in, so I called from a hotel phone to the front desk to let them know. They said they would take care of it, but I did not see a hotel representative during the next hour or so we were there, and again, children were in the whirlpool. I feel that the staff of the hotel should regularly monitor and enforce this rule, since the parents seem unwilling to follow it on their own. We tend to really enjoy the pool/hottub at hotels we visit, so I'm not sure I'd come here again...

It's very near to all the good restaurants and Chicago River Walk.Clubs like Excalibur, Andy's live jazz and restuarants like Shaw Crab house,Braazars,Benny's Steak House are very close. -Room: My room was quite big with all the facilities like a small fridge, microwave,coffee machine,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.The room had a very good Wi-Fi connection.Closet with security safe.

They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting a cab or getting tickets for the local cubs game. -Hotel: It had a business centre which has Internet,printer and fax facility. The pool and jacuzzi area is clean enough to be used.Gym is very basic,they should add some more equimenmts. -Food: The complimentary breakfast was very good.It consisted of waffles,coffee,cakes,eggs,juice machine,fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits,sausage and different variety of cereals. The bad part is if you are staying too long in the Hotel like I did, one does get bored with the same breakfast daily. I did request them to change their menu.Will have to stay again at Hampton to check if they changed it or not. -Drawbacks: It's very near to fire station so there is a constant disturbance due to fire alarm voice.

It modern, tasteful, and looks like something you'd see in the most upscale NY Hotel. - The beds are super comfortable. - The water pressure in the shower is excellent. (Nothing is worse than discovering a hotel with low flow shower heads!) - The happy hour and night life is great. (And this was on a Tue and Wed - The weekends are probably even better.) - You can walk to lots of great restaurants and shopping. - They have bikes that you can borrow - FOR FREE! - Wifi is free and easy to access. The Cons: - None, Zero, Zilch I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.";5;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

The restaurant downstairs had great food and divine desserts, and very good coffee.  There was a bar that was quite full the whole period of my stay and a decent selection of wine. I love the room decor and I had a nice view out my window as well. The bathroom was teeny tiny but it was adequate for one person. The room itself was spacious enough and uncluttered, just the way I like it. I think the location is wonderful, the general area was pretty safe. I'd say that the main negative for me was the noise level from outside the room during the day (while cleaning? not sure) but it was fairly quiet at night.";4;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

Except for the valet attendants... and that is where things got really bad for us.  We parked our car there both at an hourly rate and overnight over the two days that we stayed there (the first night I drove home to the suburbs to be with our baby)s....  I paid for the valet, tipped the attendants who had parked my car waaaay off to the side (of course!) and got home after our stay to find that my brand new car was damaged noticeably in two places--the fender and the bumper.  Mind you, this isn't the 'I didn't notice' kind of damage.  Rather, someone tapped (rather hard) against a wall or another car, and another car skinned my car's rear bumper.  And so begins my conversion from lukewarm guest to horribly dissatisfied guest.   The hotel gave me the number of the valet company and told me not to call that day because the owner, with whom I would need to speak, would be out of the office.  I called the next morning and spoke with Kathy from GP parking who said she would call me back.  Three days later, still no return call, I call Kathy, ask to speak to Tom, the owner, she says that she is actually the person I should talk to and 'why did I wait so long to say anything--and why didn't I say something when I picked the car up from the attendants--and not to say that you would, but you could have had an incident on the way home that caused this damage but you want to blame it on us so that we pay for it.....'  She continued like that, accusing me of lying and being overall incredibly rude, disinterested and insulting about the whole thing.   So I called the hotel.  The ladies at the hotel (first Emelia, then MaryBeth) were nice as pie to me and supposedly did get in touch with their valet company.  By their accounts the valet company conducted a thorough (impartial????) investigation and will not take any responsibility for my vehicle's damage.   I am, absolutely, without a doubt, 100% certain that they did, in fact, damage my car.  And I PAID THEM TO DO IT!  I EVEN TIPPED THEM!!!!!   My friends' Most Expensive Wedding I Ever Paid For As An Attendee/Maid of Honor continues to suck my wallet dry.  The damage most certainly exceeds the cost of my hotel room (and I mentioned we stayed in a suite, right?).  Of course, Public Chicago is not responsible because the hotel hired the horribly rude folk from GP parking to do their valet for them, but they do charge for the valet directly through the hotel.  They didn't even, as a simple gesture, offer to refund the valet fee.  Or any portion of my hotel stay.  Or agree to fire their valet service, which frankly would have been a slightly satisfactory response.....  If they had just told me then and there that they had damaged my car, I would have been okay with it--and I really would have appreciated their honesty.  But they didn't have the decency to do so, and now I hemorrhage more money.  And, did I mention, I absolutely DETEST the institution they call the Public Hotel Chicago????  I do.  I am horribly dissappointed and insulted by the way I was treated.";1;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
292;2/26/2012;BZNqgeDceYtzMJIPGy6EzQ;idtf-MaJZo6F5jL3NcBB_w;"I love staying in new ""concept"" hotels so when Public opened last year, I wanted to check it out. We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it but it didn't make as big as an impression on us like the Conrad and Palomar did. This is the former Ambassador hotel and Public plays with a lot of the Ambassador style.  This was not a total renovation. Public simply added a few modern touches. Rooms are minimal in style but effective and comfortable. Our room had a very narrow entryway in which a room service tray could barely fit through.  Doors on the closet and bathroom are the originals left over from the Ambassador so they are old and don't close very well.  I love the placement of quirky photos around the room. My biggest complaint with the rooms would have to be the fairly thin walls. If the person in the next room talks slightly above a normal speaking voice be prepared to hear everything. Bathroom was small but had nice clean lines. The bathtub walls were really high for some reason. We ordered their room service, Public Express, for dinner and breakfast. While the dinner was exceptional, breakfast was just okay. Better than Burger King but I've had better at other hotels. The rest of the hotel looks great and the lobby and restaurant are packed on the weekends. Fitness center is very well equipped. But as other people have noted on here, the hallways and especially the elevators are too dark. You can't see which button to push to get to your floor.  Location is nice since it's close to Michigan Avenue but not directly on the busy street.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. So why don't I love it? Like I said, Hotel Palomar and the Conrad ""wow"" me with their style and service. I think Public is going more for an ""understated"" vibe which is good. I guess I like my automatic upgrades for being a Hilton Diamond member @ Conrad. Or I look forward to my wine hour and zebra print robes @ Palomar. It's a hotel. I kind of prefer ""fancy"" not ""understated"".";4;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

All in all it was a pleasant experience, I enjoyed the residential location as well as the decor and the fact that there is a Jean-Georges outpost on site. Somewhere the tag line ""At PUBLIC, service matters most."" doesn't quite translate successfully.  The staff, although attentive, is not quite there in terms of anticipating a guest's needs.  A birthday cake was delivered without silverware or plates to eat it with.  A quick call to the front desk solved the problem in less than 10 minutes.   I requested said cake too late in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request.  The concierge was at a loss as well.  I had to suggest to her to see if there were any bakeries near by which could come thru.  I was able to arrange for the cake from 35,000 feet in the air.  I would think that a good concierge would have been able to manage it from less than  1/2 mile away. If the hotel were not to bill itself as a new breed focused on service then I would have given them all 5 stars.  But when they are so focused on selling themselves as a service institution and then come short, I simply cannot be an 100% fan.";3;0;0;1;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

Travel Date:  July 2-8, 2012 We were greeted at our car by an eager bellboy.  He quickly packed the luggage cart with the aid of our Echo Limousine driver (recommended).  The common spaces are lovely and well appointed.  At check-in my partner and I were promptly assisted.  The desk clerk noticed I had booked a smokin' hot special online for a regular queen room.  When she saw the height of my partner, 6'3"", she said, ""let's see if we can find something a little bigger.""  She upgraded our room, at no additional cost, to a corner King Deluxe.  We had three large windows, a full walk-in closet and plenty of room for our week long stay.   The building is two blocks from the Lake and in a beautiful Near North neighborhood.  Just a few blocks south is the Rush St and Division St scene.  Good nightlife, restaurants, music and cocktails.  A taxi was always waiting and if you prefer public transportation the Red Line has a station at State/Division.  If you like car service, UBER has fantastic coverage in the downtown area and is never more than a couple of minutes from Public. Pump Room provided a fantastic Fourth of July Dinner for 11 guests at a moment's notice.  They even comped a selection of flatbreads.   Our stay was not without hiccups...  We experienced Chicago's hottest July Fourth in over 100 years.  This caused the satellite receivers to overheat and we lost TV reception for two partial days and one full day.  Upon inquiring about the loss of signal, several options were provided, free movie tickets, free bike rentals or assistance booking other entertainment, spa services & tours.  Our shower head had a leak that sprayed water backwards directly on the wall and ceiling.  It didn't bother me but I figured I'd let them know to avoid future damage to the walls.  They sent a repairman after we left the room for the day and when we returned we had a voice-mail from guest services notifying us of the repair and apologizing for the (nonexistent) inconvenience.   Everyone we encountered was fantastic; great service in Pump Room, fantastic mixologists in both bars, quick room service and helpful guest relations.   The only thing missing is a day spa, of course I knew this when I booked the room.  They partner with a place just down the street but I feel that a Hotel of this caliber should have an in-house facility.

I have always been a fan of the Ian Schrager Hotel group and I was thrilled to hear that they were opening in a grand old dame of properties, the former Ambassador East.   I wasn't quite sure how a finger on the pulse, New York second kind of guy would treat the aging beauty but I was dumbfounded by the gentle transititon that holds true the elegance of the days of grandiose with slick and contemporary style. Gratefful a dear friend was touring with an old school rocker that was housed in this gem and got to take a mini staycation while hanging out with rockstars.   So yes, the Pump Room was not my Grandma's cocktail salon and Kup and Harry Caray were just hovering from the heavens above but it was a definitely a hot crowd full of ""all the young dudes"" and lots of smoking hot beauties holding court.   Staff was fantastic as is expected from the Rockit Ranch crew and service was fast and furious. Rooms were spacious for a Schrager property says the girl who has spend extended stays at Paramount, Royalton and Morgans in my day.   Like double the size.  Ikea like in nature but sleek and comfy none the less.  Exquisite linens and lux robes and towels were my saving grace.   I will note I mistook a mirror for a door at one point and may or may not have lifted it off the wall but we'll leave that for later.   Staycation was amazing....... Public rooms are exquisite with soft yet sleek design elements, engaging staff and absolutely gorgeous finishes.   Clean, chic, sophisticated cool.  Worlds collide.  In a nutshell: old dog did new tricks quite well.";5;5;2;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

We ate at the restaurant that evening, and the food was excellent.  I had the Pork Tenderloin and my wife had their Weiner Schnitzel.  The Schnitzel was outstanding.  They also had a good wine list, however later i found out the glass of $12 Chardonnay i was drinking retailed for $10.99 a bottle.  That is some mark up. After dinner we had another drink in the lobby which turned into a total 40 to 60 year old meat market.  We went to sleep early, but i hear the crowd gets younger as thee night goes on.  It was good people watching anyway. Brunch in the morning wasn't bad, but next time i will meander over to the Original House of Pancakes off Rush street.

Unfortunately because we were not ready for the room to be serviced at 8:45, it was not cleaned! This happened two days in a row. It just seems senseless to me to not plan to clean rooms that will remain occupied for a few more days later than 8:45. I didnt have any of the issues with the televisions (big flat screen in our room) or elevators (fast and always available). I would definitely stay here again, but would have had a better experience if the room cleaning had been different.";3;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

It was a horribly rainy day when we arrived, but the lobby was spotless and fresh smelling. We were checked in quickly and got our free cookies... WOOHOO!! (Got one later too!) The room was spotless with a great view. Extememly quiet and the bed was like a cloud.

She decided to go around this by booking us on a red-eye out, hoping she could pass out and wake up refreshed in Chicago....Perfect plan, except..... Our plane touched down in Chicago at 5:45am...Most hotels don't let you check in until 3pm. This was going to be interesting. We arrived at Doubletree shortly after and were greeted by the front desk person...Or maybe ""greeted"" is too generous. I'm pretty sure he kinda just nodded. Hmmm. We asked if there was anyway to check in early but he explained that they were completely booked solid and he didn't have anything available. I asked if we could get a room once people started checking out and he told me, ""I don't know, you're going to have to get with the first shift about that"" Huh? I don't speak hotel lingo, but I'm no idiot. He basically said, ""I don't care, it's not my problem but the next shift might care and want to fix your problem"" Whatever. We checked our bags and hit the pavement. Great location....comfy beds....and cookies....Einstein Bagels downstairs with my favorite coffee.....Pluses! I couldn't 4 star this joint because of the busted elevator, or maybe it wasn't busted but there was only one that worked at any given time....took forever.....sardine can style every ride no matter what time of day or night... And of course the douchey night audit guy we met our first morning there...what a miserable little person.

Both ceremony and reception took place here in their LaSalle Ballroom and I will post pictures once I get them from my photographer.  The ballroom is decorated with beautiful chandeliers in an amber wash but the carpet, though new, is slightly hideous - but I guess hotels have to have ""busy"" carpets to keep the dirt from showing. Rebecca Kuzelka - the most amazing and organized wedding coordinator ever!  There is something to be said about someone who already has a full plate on her hands, yet she does an incredible jobs of making ME, the bride, feel like I am her ONLY account.  Her attention to detail, her proactive spirit to make sure I have not forgotten anything (when there is so much going on, only a professional like Rebecca can point out the little details that may have been overlooked).  I had 10 months to plan my wedding and unfortunately, the person that I signed the contract with decided not to show up to work one day and I was lost without a coordinator for over two months.  Rebecca took on the position in June and was on top of everything as soon as she started.  What also made it really easy was that her ""style"" was similar to mine - Minimalistic and trendy - so the way she executed her job was the same way I envisioned my wedding.  Of course, I did my homework and outlined everything I needed done and was worried that the actual day wouldn't go smoothly - However, the day was seamless and I put my FULL trust in her and she made my day the happiest day of my life (well almost, marrying my best friend was even better)!  She organized all my vendors, all the staff, ensured everyone was where they needed to be and had everything done before I even thought about it.  I couldn't have been happier! Ben - I guess he is the lead doorman - Wow - he treated my guests with a smile all the time, no matter how long his shift was!  Thanks Ben! Alfredo - awesome concierge - really took care of me and my out of town guests who probably bombarded him with questions and reservations of all sorts - Friendly and professional Chef Alfredo - Executive Chef - I had always wanted an Asian Fusion menu for my wedding because I knew that the traditional Chinese banquet would not suit all the palates of my friends. He welcomed all my suggestions to incorporate many of the Chinese traditions of a wedding menu.  We were able to include roast pork, peking duck, udon noodles, wasabi, ginger, enoki mushrooms, bok choy and fish into the menus and the food was incredible!  We requested medium rare filets for all who ordered it and they were all cooked PERFECTLY medium rare!  It's not easy to cook for 85 guests to perfection but all of my guest said that this was the BEST wedding meal they have EVER had in their life.  I think the Hors D'oeurves were really the star of the show, people couldn't stop eating them! Waitstaff during the reception - I don't remember the name of the head honcho there, but he was extremely attentive to our needs during dinner, making sure that we enjoyed our food and it was hot enough etc.  His wait staff was classy and elegant serving everything butler style in tuxedos and white gloves!  Loved it! Bridal Suite - We were booked into room 2616 which is the Michigan Suite - gorgeous city views with a HUGE dining table, wet bar, seating area for 10, a Murphy Bed - then adjacent to the room was the master bedroom and a giant bathroom with a standing shower and a bathtub fit for two.  Largely impressed with this and tastefully decorated (recently renovated).  It also had an alarm clock with iPod connections but the TV was outdated and no DVD player in the room.  Our king sized bed was super comfy and the murphy bed even, was AWESOME - my maid of honor slept there the night before and she has insomnia - even she was able to catch a couple hours of zzz's prior to the big day! I'm so thankful for the people at the Doubletree who made this a great day for us!  I recommend the staff and services of this hotel to anyone looking for a wedding venue in downtown Chicago.";5;7;4;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

I overheard a lady talking in the restaurant how she must have moved something on the weight-sensitive trays and was charged. I don't know why they have to set it up that way. It should allow for a delay in case something is picked up and examined. Maybe five minutes. I was also a little disappointed that the free breakfast with my Gold status with Hilton was only a continental breakfast and to get anything hot it was an extra $6.

338;7/31/2012;I5dccP69n9D2rQWpNE-zNA;jTlvFiQ-AtzGlb7QjARHnQ;"So...for this review I decided to wait and see if I was less irritated and my memories of a wonderful night were more blurred by time. Not going to happen apparently. This review should begin with me finding a great deal at this hotel, one within walking distance of an L stop, Navy Pier, and super close to my dinner date destination. I made reservations, gave a credit card number and everything. In preparation for my romantic weekend, I called the hotel to ask about parking and other random questions. I got all the answers I needed from a super helpful desk attendant and gave a rave YELP tip accordingly. Fast forward to the actual weekend. We parked in the adjoining parking garage, no breaks on price even though you're staying with the connected hotel, at 9AM and started our day around town. After trekking our butts around all day, we finally got to the hotel and started to check in. Since this was a surprise for the bf, I was in charge. Let me take this chance to say they checked me in as the wrong person. They took my name, double checked that with my ID and charged my card. They said they'd put a ""hold"" on my card until the next morning when the bill was settled, but online banking and handy text alerts let me know they charged my card 2 minutes after checking me into my room. The odd check-in procedure where they welcomed me back (I'd never stayed there before), tried to have a reservation for one (when there were clearly two of us; I said we were celebrating a late Valentine's for God sake) and looked down right confused when I said I'd only be staying for one night, should have tipped me off, but I was ready to take off my boots and sit the f*ck down. The person it should have tipped off was the desk attendant checking me in. Regardless, they produced two keys for an amazing room. The satisfaction on my bf's face alone was worth the hassle, so far. We got ready for dinner, the concierge called us a cab and we were out for the night. Fast forward to 1AM. The bf and I return from the best steak dinner and drinks we've had in forever, we're a little tipsy and ready to pass out, snuggle style. This hotel uses keys to operate the elevator, safety first, hell ya. So we use our keys and get to our floor. (Note: the keys work). We get to our room and try my key. Doesn't work. Maybe I'm more intoxicated than I thought. Try my bf's. Also doesn't work. Flabbergasted and quickly sobering up, riding down to the lobby. After a bit of chatting with the attendants, we find out there was a mistake and they checked me in as the wrong person so they'd have to CHECK MY ID to give me new keys to the room. Security is one thing, but YOU let me into your hotel, charged MY card and have ALL of my things in your room, which I can't access because of YOUR mistake. A few weird looks from the staff and two new keys later, we were back in our room. They slipped the bill under the door sometime in the morning and apparently that meant we were checked out. Though that was not apparent to me, so I spent 10 minutes waiting in line to check out, only to have them look at me like I had five heads. The bottom line: parking is super expensive (9am Friday to 2pm Sat = $146) and super convenient for the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and has a decent location,  but the customer service leaves something to be desired.";2;2;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

So awesome! The attached Starbucks was super handy, the rooms were small but comfortable and we were central to everywhere we wanted to go- everything was a short walk away. One hiccup to our stay was housekeeping, we were gone Saturday from 10 am- 4:30 pm, and our room wasn't touched. They got us fresh towels as soon as we asked, and it's not like I make my bed at home, so this was a minor issue. Also, they had charged us for parking ($42 a day, W.T.F!!!!) even though we flew down. Whatevs, the cranky Sunday front desk woman eventually took care of the charge... she also messed up our late check out, but since I'm so kind and flexible, it wasn't an issue ;) This place is no frills and not cheap if you don't have points, but it seems reasonable enough for the location.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!";5;0;1;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

The attached restaurant, Viand, was okay - the eggs and sausage were a little pricy compared to other restaurants a few blocks away.  Will definitely consider this place for a possible vacation stay.";4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

The staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was big and very clean and comfortable.  We had a nice view as we were up pretty high.  It wasn't noisy in the hotel and the beds were heavenly.  Plus, they get an A+ for having curtains that actually close all the way over the windows! My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge, which was a bummer since we had a lot of leftovers we wanted to eat for lunch the next day. All in all, this was a great hotel and in a really perfect location.  A short walk over to Rush, Navy Pier, the river, downtown, and the Red Line.";4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

This is why I'm super impressed with my stay at this Marriott and plan to write a personal email to the front desk managers to honor some extraordinary staff members of his such as Crystal Kwak and John. My stay at the hotel began with a sour note, due to my flight delay i didnt not arrive until 11pm and came to find out that there is no room at this marriot for me even though I have a confirmed reservation. John, the front desk staff, explained the situation and a room was quickly rebooked for me at James Hotel which is just 1 block away. Without me requesting it, a staff member, Rick, walked with me to James hotel for safety measures. Exhausted from 15+hour of travel, my stay at the James hotel was a pleasant one. The next day, when I ""re-check in"" at the front desk I was greeted with Crystal Kwak, an assistant front desk manager. I told her my name and she had the look immediate that she knew me, she told me how sorry she was to know that I had to get re-booked to another hotel last night and that she's so glad I'm staying here now. Her warmth and sincerity resonated with me and I, too,  was glad to be back in Marrriott. Afterward unpacking my bags, I had a surprise room delivery of a complimentary bottle of Merlot, 2 iced bottled water and a large box of mint chocolate. Needless to say, I went back to Crystal the next day and thanked her personally to make my stay a pleasant one. This hotel has amazing location, close proximity to just about everything, staff is courteous and thoughtful, and this is for an extremely busy hotel that's buzzing all the time (yes even at 11pm!) Which only makes me appreciate all the personal touches even more because it's easy to forget a customer's value in a sea of customers but they didn't do that.

I pointed her to my watch and indicated that it was still before check-out time, so I'd please like my room. I also mentioned that I have Platinum status with Marriott. She quickly reinstated my reservation and checked me in. The room was just right for a Courtyard with a view looking west. Oddly, it was two separate windows with one of the support pillars in between. After crashing for a few hours, at 2 PM I took the ""do not disturb"" off the door and headed back to the client. Returning much later, the room had not been done up. I was too tired to complain. The little tent card in the room clearly said that rooms are cleaned until 5 PM. Oh well. Bed? Comfortable. Room?

I don't know, but upon entering my room, I felt almost as if I were at the Ritz. No doubt, however: this _is_ a very upscale Courtyard, despite being no pricier than usual. My room and bathroom were spotless and actually glamorous under the incandescence and the city lights, if that makes any sense. In the daytime, the room would look less relaxing.

Because they have a restaurant on-site, room service is available.

Michelle and Melissa in Sales were great.  The hotel just renovated most, if not all of it's rooms and all of our guests loved it.  They gave us great upgrades as well.

The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner.  Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up.  They also demonstrated empathy.  Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.   The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc.  We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers.  If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it.  Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot.  (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).   In summary, the courtyard has the best of all worlds: good location, free useful amenities, approachable staff, AND one can actually earn points for a stay.";5;0;0;1;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

When I asked the concierge, he responded that it would be open shortly. A few minutes later, I see an employee hurry in preparing to open. When I asked her when they would be ready, she responded that they open at 7AM. WTF. Third, the hotel offers a ""green choice"" program where you receive either 500 Starwood points or a $5 voucher if you choose not to have your sheets/towels replaced for a day. I opted for this offer but didn't receiver EITHER points or a voucher when I checked out. Fourth, the room service charges are ABSURD:""$5 delivery charge, 24% service charge, and 11% sales tax."" Despite having the luxury to expense my meals during my stay, I refuse to pay for such a rip-off.";2;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
376;6/22/2011;JP3qruylt68ktCZPQGZ3Dg;komqeuyKSNErTspXCtKAkg;"stayed at the Westin on N. Michigan Avenue during Memorial Day Weekend. First off, we landed in O'Hare and took the subway to the hotel. After switching trains in downtown Chicago and walking 6 blocks we finally arrived at the hotel. There are only two things going for the Westin on Michigan Ave, it's location to shopping and the Westin Heavenly Bed. One of which you could get at another Westin or Starwoods property and the other via taxi. Check in was quick and since I am a ""preferred Starwoods Member"" I was told I was upgraded to a higher floor reserved for ""preferred members"". The room did not appear to be ""preferred"". It was directly behind the service elevators and I could hear the elevators operating all day and night. Luckily I brought ear plugs to wear while sleeping otherwise I would have gotten no sleep. Additionally, the rooms themselves are not quiet. You could hear anyone and everyone in the hallways (and there were lots of unruly screaming children running down the halls too). The room itself was on the smaller side, a king size bed, two night stands, a bureau with TV on top, desk and soft chair with ottoman. My one complaint about the furniture, which I don't usually comment on, was that there were not drawers on the nightstands only doors that opened to the space below. Additionally, there were no drawers in the desk either. The only drawers in the room were the 4 small drawers in the bureau under the TV. The other part of the bureau housed the refrigerator with stocked overpriced items. The bathroom was standard for a hotel room and appeared clean although the housekeeping staff never gave us an extra towel or soap or shampoo. Being a preferred member I also got free Wi-fi access, however, the wi-fi here was pathetic. I had faster service on my 3G phone than the wifi, it was a worthless benefit. A big beef I have with hotels is that the beds are not completely made. After sleeping in the bed once I once again found that the sheets did not reach the bottom of the bed and the mattress and the small mattress pad were exposed. I had to pull off all the sheets and covers so that the staff would correct it. Additionally, the Westin usually gives you extra pillows in the room, this Westin did not, however, housekeeping did provide us with a few extra pillows. Westin offers a workout facility in each of their hotels. I've been to some really nice hotel facilities and some not-so nice ones, this hotel ranks in the middle. They did provide dumbbells but had no cable machine and 4 plate type machines. There were also a couple of aerobic machines (treadmill/ellipticals) but not many. Our room did not have a view either. We overlooked another building across the way. As I stated in the beginning, the Westin Heavenly bed was the only plus to our visit. Would be stay here again? No, while we like Starwood properties, we would try another first. When you pay more money for a Starwood property, you expect higher service and quality. This property did not deliver.";2;4;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

They said yes on Friday, but when I checked out on Monday I was pleasantly surprised with several internet charges that they're not taking off. Also - if you're expecting to sleep soundly til say 9, you'll be awakened by the sounds of their maintenance and renovation crews drilling things into the wall or dropping things on the ground. Which is something they don't tell you about when you check in.   Yes the beds are comfortable but there's another Westin on River North that's really easily accessible.

Once we did check in and went to our room, it was nice but in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room makes everything look jaundiced. In our particular case, there was an annoying, loud fan blowing which could only be turned off by calling maintenance, which I did 3 times, with a fourth stop at the front desk before the matter was resolved.

I'm kind of conflicted with this place.  The location is awesome.  Seriously.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop within a 15 min walk.  The area is very posh and clean - it's the Magnificent Mile for goodness sake! However, a few things kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of them are things that the Westin could improve, others are just things you'd find anywhere in downtown Chicago and I should learn to deal with. First of all, forget self-parking unless you want to park at the Hancock across the street - even then I think you'll pay ~$40/day.   Parking at the Westin is $53/day.  I thought San Francisco was bad at $30 ish/day.  Oh well, that's part of staying downtown and it's not like the Westin is the only one price gouging.  OK, I'll move on. The rooms were small and boring - far too clinical for my taste.  Boring white walls, etc. The beds are awesome - that comes with the territory when you're dealing with Westin or the W. My bathroom had a faulty toilet. There was a TON of mold/mildew built up in the corners of the tub (both outside and inside).  What's disturbing is that they just tried to rub caulking over it rather than actually fix the problem.  I meant to take pictures and forgot.  However, feel free to visit room 949 and you'll get to enjoy it as well.  :p Wireless internet access is pretty awful (when you can get it to work).  It sucks being tethered to the desk but I had no choice most of the time. Room service prices were STUPID. Example: Small Cobb Salad and bowl of soup w/ glass of water.  $40.  WTF?  $5 delivery charge, 5% service charge, etc. They charged me double for parking on one of the days - that's $106 folks!  They fixed it of course. The front desk personnel are great - no issues with them at all.  I really liked the servers at The Grill (during breakfast).  They pretty much rocked and actually had a personality. So, if this Westin was in a worse location, I'd never return.  However, it is in a great location and they do run specials from time to time.  I just can't help but think that there might be better options out there for the money.";3;2;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

The only thing that I might complain about was the noise from the elevators (try to get a room away from them), but I won't dwell on that, because the staff was fantastic.

The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on.  Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.   It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat.  But sadly and surprisingly, Starwood has allowed this hotel to deteriorate.  Even an average Westin at this location would be incredible -- I hope they pull it together because today, this hotel aspires to average.";2;1;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

When I got engaged, I traversed the whole city in search of a reception venue that screamed ""Chicago.""  Originally, I was determined to have a non-traditional venue, but I begrudgingly checked out some downtown hotels-- and was really surprised at how much I liked the Westin. The ballroom looked out onto Michigan Ave, everything was inclusive of sales tax/service charge so the prices you saw were what you were charged (the 30% was not tacked on afterward like comparable downtown hotels), the decor was clean & contemporary without being too trendy, and best of all, it was nice but without the snootiness. (Seriously, I cannot stand pretentiousness!) The biggest gamble was the food as you sign the contract before the tasting, but it all turned out splendidly in the end. The food was awesome at the tasting and I was just praying it would be the same at the event-- and it was. People are still raving to us & our families about how great it all was, especially the steak. I can attest to its quality myself, as you bet your ass I made sure that I would be eating the meal I was paying for. :-) And while I didn't stay in a typical room, I did get a kickass suite to get ready in, and I took advantage of getting it at the discounted room block rate for the night before as well. Check-in wasn't until 3, but the room was ready for me at noon. It had an awesome view looking out onto Michigan Ave & the bed was plush & comfy-- super important for a stressed out insomniac bride-to-be! This is not your cheapest option for a Chicago wedding, but it truly is a good value for a downtown hotel right on Michigan Avenue, and less expensive than the nearby comparable hotels. P.S. If you do host an event here, and have the money upfront & can make the payments in full, get a Starwood Amex credit card. You'll thank me later. :-)";5;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag. When I'm paying for this service, it should be done correctly. The service at this hotel is ridiculously unexcusable!!!";1;4;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

If not for the following inconveniences and lack of service, I would probably give it 4 stars: Check-in was a huge hassle because I unwittingly used http://getaroom.com, when I thought I was calling the hotel directly.  Eventually, after waiting over 20 minutes, the people at the desk were willing to put a hold on my credit card while they waited for http://getaroom.com to get back to them about my reservation, which was already paid for.  But they could have done that from the start, rather than making me stand in the lobby for all of that time. Also, I was told internet would be free in my room.  It asked to charge me at log on, so I called to the front desk.  they told me to accept the charges, and assured me that I would not be charged.  At check-out, the charge was on my invoice.  The person at the counter printed me a new invoice, and assured me I would not be charged.  Two days later, I notice that my bank account has been charged $13 for internet usage.  I am now waiting for the hotel to refund it. In addition, very early on Sunday morning, the housekeeping attempted to open my door, because I forgot to put up a ""do not disturb"" sign. I thought that was rude and I am glad that I had latched the interior door lock, otherwise she would have walked right in. Also, be aware that parking is $60 per day and valet only. When I got my car, the window was rolled halfway down on the passenger side, which makes me believe it was probably left that way all night.   Overall, not the worst hotel I have stayed at, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location and price were ok, but the service really kind of sucked.";3;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

My room was at the front of the hotel and I didn't find the noise of the train to bother me at all. The staff was very friendly, and the room was extremely clean (I cleaned rooms in a former life so I'm picky). I plan on using this hotel again when I come back and the price was such a bargain for the room and the parking, that it makes it hard for me not to use them again.

From the doorman, to bellman, to desk clerk-- each and every one was above and beyond in courtesy and professionalism. I've stayed at many five star hotels and this staff is second to none. The hotel itself is cute on the inside. I was initially concerned because it's right on the el tracks, but once inside, didn't notice the sound unless I was specifically listening for it. The room was lovely. We had a suite with a king bedroom. The bathroom is enormous. Everything looked new and clean. (FYI, the suite has a double door between the living area and sleeping area, but the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. I think it's to help air circulation. Since my son was on the sofa bed, this was a bit of a concern, but the sound was still muted between the two areas, so you can watch tv without disturbing little ones with early bed times.) There was a mini fridge in the room. The lobby is lovely, but the bar is in the diner restaurant on the first level. I inquired and the desk clerk told me it's fine to bring cocktails from the restaurant to the lobby. I'd recommend that. The restaurant serves comfort food. Nothing outstanding.

The location cannot be beat, at least for our purposes: close to both the Blue and Red lines and a couple blocks from the Metra station and Millenium Park, it's right in the middle of everything. The staff was without exception friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating.  They have a wine hour for guests from 5-6pm which featured a selection of two wines from California and a very nice sangria the night we attended.  They also have an assortment of coffee and tea available in the lobby in the mornings.  We did not try the lobby restaurant, but observed that the bar seems to close kind of early for a hotel bar. Wireless is free if you sign up for their affinity program, which we did.  At least in our room, though the signal was plenty strong, the connection seemed very slow even for the purposes of checking e-mail.

Another plus was the free wine in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful and comfortable) every day between 4-6pm (I think). Also I thought the nightly rates were very reasonable for the wonderful location. Unfortunately, everyone can have different experiences in the same establishment, and if we had been in another room or another floor it could have been a 5 star experience. BUT, the toilet in our room exploded and flooded the ENTIRE hotel room while we were gone (Thank God) due to a plumbing issue in their building. It was disgusting. They moved us to another room (and most of our stuff thankfully stayed dry). To apologize to us they took our home address and promised to send a lovely basket or something. NEVER CAME. Also they didn't knock off any $$ for the stay. They gave us a certificate for one free drink at their bar, but that was it. Doesn't that seem like bad service?

The restoration job Kimpton has done on Daniel Burnham's 1895 predecessor to today's skyscraper is truly wonderful. I was much happier staying at this little boutique hotel this past week on my business trip than one of the other big name neighbors. Its ideally located to all that the Loop offers. If given a choice - I'll be back here again when staying in Chicago. From the moment you walk into the dark wood reception area with its quaint little sitting area, you are greeted by smiling faces eager to make your stay a success. Like most other Kimpton properties they offer an evening wine reception and have a generous pet policy. It pays to be a member of their Kimpton In Touch program (free) as you get free internet access, $10 mini-bar credit and free continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. A couple of tips for this particular location: - You will get an actual key to your room. At first I loved concept this antiquated concept, hearkening back to a simpler time. But after a week of the key jingling in my pocket and trying not to lose the darn thing - I think I'd rather leave this part of history behind and have the added security of modern key cards. - There aren't hairdryers in the rooms (at least in mine) but they will bring one up to you. - Rooms are a little small. Try to get at least a queen or king room - at 5.4 my footsies were hanging off the double bed unless I scrunched all the way up on my pillows. Issue solved by sleeping diagonally - but the larger bed would have been nice. - Request an upper floor room. I was the 5th floor overlooking Washington and State, but I could still hear quite a bit of noise from the street and ""L"". Didn't keep me from sleeping well though.";4;3;3;3;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel...  Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras!  Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room!  Ok a fluke...  Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street.  No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep.  So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street.

I have to say that while this Red Roof Inn was run down, it wasn't dirty or grimy. The staff was non-existent.

One guest got turned away because he arrived late, which is something that should not happen for a group. I never followed up on it, so I'm not sure what happened exactly but thats what I heard. Either way they should have made some arrangment to get them situated. We also had some problems with guests getting rooms in our block, people saying that the block was full when it really wasn't.

Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream ""generic chain"" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back!

I booked through a show I go to 6 times a year and it was my first time at the Amalfi.  I got a room on the alley (lovely I know), and there was constant noise ALL NIGHT LONG! Glass breaking, loud party goers, blasted trash trucks at all hours! Maybe invest in better windows Amalfi? My favorite part was on the day I checked out the maids came to all the rooms on my floor knocking at 7:30 and when I said I was still using the room she shouted through the door ""When are you leaving!"", um... not the friendliest service! I also had an issue with my shower and called down and asked them to service it 2 days in a row and don't think anyone ever came to fix it because it still had issues. My company had to send me a box and they charged me a $5 recieving fee?  They never even brought the box to my room, I had to go down two days in a row and ask for it. Good qualities: Nice rooms for the price, Chicago is PRICEY! Within walking distance to my destination the Merchandise Mart.  Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice touch.

I see people complain about the food, that they don't have room service, yes I agree that it sucks to have Harry Cary's as the only option.

For a quick family trip (my mom, dad and brother), we decided to head to Chicago to visit old friends. Unfortunately, because of the convention, every last hotel room in the city was booked. Finally, we were able to find one last room at the Amalfi Hotel. As a 20 something, the prospect of sharing one hotel room with my parents and my younger brother was frightening. Fortunately, the Amalfi made it an amazing experience. The room was spacious enough with it's 2 queen sized beds and large bathroom to accomodate us and our stuff. Upon check in the concierge remembered my mother from their phone conversation a few days prior and was so sweet, friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for places to go for dinner and drinks which really made the trip all the more worthwhile. One of the best perks is the free happy hour from 5:30-7pm every night. They served tons of antipasti appetizers - cheeses, breads, olives, bruschetta, etc. They also had a bartender making any drink you wished. The complimentary breakfast was great too! They had one on every floor and served standard croissants, bagels, yogurt etc. The gym was also great - plenty of cardio equipment, free weights, and fun movies playing on the tv to keep you entertained. The location was great too, which a few bars and restaurants within a few blocks and the Magnificent Mile a few blocks more. This hotel had everything you needed and wanted for a place to stay in Chicago and great staff and amenities to make the trip even more pleasant.

I'm not sure if all the rooms were like the one we got, or if we just lucked out completely, but WOW. Modern yet comfortable furnishings. Large and spacious bathroom with colorful polka dots EVERYWHERE. And even though the room itself left little space to run around and do cartwheels, we were pleasantly happy with our stay. We got a good deal (price divided by 2), and it was a pedestrian friendly commute to and from the bar/club scene.

The main reason is that it is centrally located right in the heart of downtown; 3 blocks from The Merchandise Mart where I usually work and only slightly further from all the fabulous shopping on Michigan Avenue. Conveniently located right across the street from Harry Carreys and right next door to Keefers...both great choices for food and drink. My only problem is that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade...it literally hasn't changed since I first stayed here 5 days ago.

There are no patches of grass in River North (only noticeable if you have to walk a dog). 2. There are a lot of hotels in River North (why didn't I notice this when I lived in Chicago?). 3. Despite the fact that it's a tourist trap, the nearby House of Blues hosts some great acts (blues and non-blues). 4. The Chicago River (and the buildings along it) at night is still a damn gorgeous sight to behold. 5. It's fun to be a tourist in a city you know how to get around. Staying at the Amalfi was also a fresh experience, as I had never been at a ""boutique hotel"" before: 1. It has a mod lobby in orange and turquoise.  No floral upholstery here! 2. Hotel staff wear clothing that matches the hotel decor (I'm serious!). 3. Free FRESH breakfast is provided.  I could have stashed a couple of those chocolate croissants and slices of cinnamon bread in my bag. 4. Cleaning staff are friendly.  Actually, this is not a good thing because I hate having someone clean up after me.  So I always clean up before the cleaning staff clean.  No, it does not make sense. 5. No extra fee is charged for having a pet. 6. Free cocktails and appetizers are provided in the evenings.  I'm still dreaming about the skinny breadsticks with sundried tomato and black bean and corn dips. 7. Cost was reasonable.  I always compare to the Federal government per diem rates for lodging, which tend to be on the low side, and the special rates at Amalfi were actually lower.";4;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

510;4/28/2011;CzUBmT0OTr-nZBbFqiOB5g;JkTtsONJBP08GbpA23FFtw;"Our stay at the Amalfi was fabulous in nearly every possible way!   -The location is terrific-River North but very close to the loop.  There are several close L stops.  Use Clark/Lake if you're arriving via CTA from the airport.  It's almost as close as State/Lake but Clark has escalators and is a larger, easier to navigate station when you're dragging luggage.  The walk to the hotel is pleasant and short. -We spent little time in the lobby but did like the deskside check in.  It's a lot more personal and relaxing than the typical ""wait in line to stand at the counter for 10 minutes"" check-in. -Our room was great!  We had an extremely comfortable king bed. The bed linens were soft and cozy.  There were plenty of pillows and the padded headboard was comfortable to prop against for reading or tv watching.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The Aveda toiletries were really nice.  The bathroom had a large counter, lots of floor area, and a lighted make up mirror.  The tub was a standard tub but had a double shower head and a curved shower curtain rod to help with that ""closed in"" feeling.  My only complaint about the bathroom was that the towels were a bit on the rough/scratchy side rather than fluffy and soft. -We were on the 4th floor overlooking Harry Carray's restaurant.  There was some noise bleeding in from outside but it was street and traffic noise, not bar goers or pedestrians.  IMO, it was similar to the noise level in any downtown hotel when you're only a few floors above street level.  We had a view of the Trump and the Marina Towers.  Not like having a spectaular skyline view but it certainly wasn't a bad view. -We loved the complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast was a couple of steps up from a typical continental breakfast.  There were a variety of pastries, bagels, doughnuts, cereal, yogurt, and fresh whole fruit.  Milk, apple juice, and orange juice were available as well as tea and coffee.  The coffee was really quite good and it was great to be able to get refills so easily. -We also really enjoyed the free drinks and appetizers each evening at the cocktail reception.  They have a nice selection of premium liquor, two white wines, two reds, two beers, and two pre-mixed specialty cocktails.  It's a small bar so they don't have every possible option but the selection is adequate.  And c'mon-it's FREE.  The food is good if largely unchanging.  Each night there was a selection of Italian cold meats, breads, cheese, and other antipasto standards-olives, artichoke hearts, peppers, etc.  One night they had Caprese salad and it was delicious.  The lounge is rather small.  If the hotel is crowded, I doubt everyone would have a seat.  We were there at an uncrowded time and one night it was still very hard to find a seat. -The business center was well-appointed with several computers (both Macs and Dells) and a quality, fast printer.  It made printing our boarding passes easier than just about anywhere I've ever stayed. -The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  When we had spotty wireless reception (which is included, by the way), they were very responsive and sent an ""engineer"" up right away to investigate the issue. -Our only real complaint was with the televisions in the rooms.  We had cold, wet weather and spent our evenings mostly relaxing in our room.  The (smallish) flat screen tvs were a disappointment.  There were no HD channels, multiple pay or ""hotel"" channels, and the reception was spotty.  Also, the remote was awful and it was excruciatingly slow changing channels or even turning up the volume!  There was a dvd player with a (small, quite limited) selection of dvds to ""check out"" in the lobby-nice touch but it wouldn't hurt to update and enlarge the library. Overall we had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Amalfi and will recommend it to friends and family.  I hope we'll be able to return sometime soon!";5;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

I'd have given the Amalfi 4 stars if not for a couple problems.  First the room, while appealing in decor, looked a little like it had been done on the cheap.  Some of the furnishings looked good but didn't have the level of quality as comparable hotels.  Plus, the carpet was really dirty in spots.  Since the place is really new, I suspect it's going to look worn before long.  There is no view as others pointed out, and the street noise can be troubling.  Finally, we had a billing issue where the rate didn't match what we'd booked on the internet.  We got it worked out but it punctuated a decent but not great stay. The overall value can be really good if you get a favorable rate.  If not, and you want an interesting newer place to stay in the same neighborhood, try the Hotel Sax.";3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
512;3/30/2011;hUoc;peVjUm6PnufDzI44vGU0Wg;"Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.";2;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

So I went down to the desk and asked the lady if there was a corner king available?  If not, not a big deal as long as she could credit me the difference in price for the room. They ended up giving us a Corner King that was nice.  It was not available until later so they let us keep our stuff in the other room, while we went out for the day, and then upgraded us when we returned from shopping. The Corner King was nice.  Extremely comfortable beds, the windows around the whole room were nice, but a lot to close up at night.  Nice views, much better than the original room where we looked into another building.  I will say other than the corridor where you walked into the room, space wise it wasn't that much different than the original room.  Not really worth the upgrade unless you want the better view and all the natural light. Breakfast and the Happy hour was a great touch.  Fruit and bagels for breakfast with your choices of juices, coffee, and tea.  nothing special but perfect for us. The Free Happy Hour was very nice - they had Sky and Belvedere Vodka, Jim Beam, Captain Morgan, and others.  White and Red wines and a couple Italian beer selections.  Nice little apps too.  anti-pasta setup, cheeses, and breads.

I would ding this hotel for not restocking shower gel - we've stayed here for 4 nights and only do I get extra shower gel on the 3rd day when we ran out  and bumped into our housekeeper that morning.   For a Fairmont, I was surprised they didn't replenish.  I understand being ""green"" and good for the environment but we paid to stay and should have essentials restocked. Hotel is definitely in a nice location and close to the Navy Pier,  Millenium Park, riverboat cruises, and Wildberry Pancake House (a great place to get breakfast).  Overall the hotel looks and feels nice.  Noise level minimal since we were on the 18th floor.  Our car was brought up promptly so service was great there. With kids, a pool is necessary and this hotel does not offer it but we were able to get access through long corridors to the Swiss Hotel's indoor ""in the sky"" pool.  Just speak to the Fairmont concierge.  From this pool location, you could get a closer view of the Navy Pier.";4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

I had the hummus plate one night and the lobster roll on another night. The conference rooms were also spacious and well equipped. The hotel catered our breakfast and lunch everyday and it was some of the best conference food I have had. There was a lot of variety for each meal, and there was dessert with lunch everyday! My one and only complaint is that my room was never restocked with the essentials. I had to call to have more coffee brought up. Also, the cups I used disappeared but new ones were not put in there place. A minor nuisance in the grand scheme of things, but it is those small details that make all the difference!

(I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.";4;7;8;6;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

The room was small and out-dated. We also had a small coffee table that's totally broken. The bathroom did not have the usual toiletries that you see at other 4-5 star hotels, q-tips/cotton balls etc, and the shower area had a strong moldy smell. The only good thing about it was that they had Miller Harris toiletries (which was not that great either.) No in-room coffee and no starbucks in the hotel. I had to walk to N Michigan Ave. for a cup of latte every morning.

The location of the Fairmont is very nice - just a short 20 minute walk out and you can get around to Navy Pier and lots of other cool locations. Walk out further 20-30 minutes and you can get your way to a sweet bar selling sweet microbrews. Yum. The rooms are really nice especially for a double bed. I can't imagine a room with larger beds or one singular king-sized bed, but I would think that it would be pretty nice! They have lots of dresser space to put your clothes in, really nice pillows and blankets, the beds definitely let your legs dangle in a child-like fashion if you wanted to, the windows don't open up a lot but they do for some air, the heater/ac works accordingly, and the bathroom.. YAY. I love clean bathrooms. And awesome baths. Really nice standing up showers. A little hide-a-seek toilet room.

We stayed for the 2010 Chicago Marathon.  If running the marathon, do not make the Fairmont your first choice, regardless of how close it is to the starting/finish line & runner reunite stations. So many things went wrong with our visit and I would be reluctant to book with them again for the 2011 marathon. When we checked in, we were given a smoking room despite requesting a non-smoking room. The room reeked of smoke...as if someone just had a cigarette in the room right before we entered.  I was with my husband and children (3-years and a 15-months), and it was completely unacceptable to have them breathing this polluted air.  And I would be running 26.2 miles...it was beyond upsetting that I'd be breathing this air the night before the big run.  The one bed also seemed a bit 'off' like it was hastily made. We called the front desk to explain the situation and were told the hotel was fully booked and the best they could do was have maintenance clean the room again.  They could not commit to a time though, told us to go out for a few hours, and hopefully it would be in better shape when we got back.  Staff was not terribly rude, but they were certainly less than helpful or sympathetic to our issues. We proceeded to look for other accommodations rather than stay here.  While we were looking for hotels, my kids knocked over the wastebasket.  Lo and behold, they found a box of cigarettes, a bottle of beer, and a used condom (not in its wrapper) and the torn condom wrapper.  Thankfully the condom was stuck to the bottom of the wastebasket, so my kids didn't touch it.  We immediately called the Front Desk, let them know what we discovered, and within 5 minutes, they called us back and moved us to a nicer, non-smoking room. Obviously, the room was not cleaned before we arrived (or at least cleaned properly), and I assume someone may have even been in there moments before we arrived which could explain the strong cigarette smell that we encountered and mussed up bed. Again, I'm extremely disappointed to have to write a terrible review, because the Fairmont is in a wonderful location and seems to be as classy as the other reviewers note.  We often use the Fairmont in my company as well, and I've heard good things about them.  But obviously our experience does not say much for their cleanliness. I do give it two stars because I appreciate the staff getting us into another room quickly, though, I wish we didn't have to come across a used room and condom to get there.  Oh, and in-room dining was good, including the big bowl of pasta I had to prepare me for the marathon.";2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

Stayed two nights here this past week and was very impressed with everything about the hotel.  Not only is the staff very friendly but they addressed any issues that came up with my stay immediately.  Since I am sure you are curious the two issues were (1) my keys didn't work one night when I came back to the room (they ran two new keys up to my floor while I waited) and (2) I needed something out of my car which I had valet parked.  They also brought it up to my room within 10-15 minutes of my request.  Very impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and very spacious.  Excellent views of the city (from the 23rd floor).  The hotel has a nice spa in the lower level of the hotel.  In addition the hotel is connected to Chicgao's ""pedway"" which is an underground tunnel system connecting man of the buildings to one another.  Thus, I was able to get Starbucks in the morning without having to go outside. The only downside to this hotel was the conference rooms.  As I mentioned I was here for a work conference.  The rooms were cold as hell.  Hmmm...not such a great analogy come to think of it.  Needless to say many people were wearing jackets etc during the conference to stay warm.  It was ridiculous especially since it is April and wasn't warm outside.

The TV was huge. one strange thing - i could hear EVERY time my neighbor showered or flushed the toilet. Very weird. And annoying. The lobby is ginourmous, with a small bar in the center with a nice selection of wines. I did like the revolving door that activated when you approached it. So yeah, the hotel is nice. But over the weekend, when I was footing the bill, I moved across the river to the Courtyard Marriott on E Hubbard street. The location was equally convenient, though we did have to walk 2 more blocks to Millenium Park. The rooms were smaller, the finishes less nice, but the service was superior. Everyone was so nice! The security guard got me ice when he was passing me in the hall and noticed the ice maker wasn't working for me. And they had a pool/jaccuzzi complimentary to guests, AND I didn't have to pay $14.95 for internet. BTW, the $14.95 for internet is for a 24 hour period that starts at midnight and goes until the next midnight. If you, for example, went out to a work dinner as soon as you got in and then wanted to check your email when you got back to the room at 11 PM, you'd pay $14.95 for the one hour until midnight, and then have to pay for it again at midnight. Apparently the internet is complimentary for gold club special people, which I was not one of. Either way, it was spotty, which is annoying especially if you're paying for it. Next time I visit Chicago, I'll probably stay elsewhere.

The bathroom is probably the biggest reason for the low marks. Everything in there seemed cramped and less than functional. While there for an event I experienced one of the ballrooms and the Moulin Rouge room. The ballroom needed some serious updating, everything just felt old and out of date. the catering was also mediocre. While in the Moulin Rouge room, there was an interesting layout with some great wallpaper, though the carpet horribly clashes and is distracting from some of the unique features of the room. Food there was much more interesting & satisfying. I've heard that Aria in the Fairmont is supposedly the best sushi in Chicago, though it's good & I loved that they were willing to make my favorite roll that was not on the menu, it is be no means the best I've ever had. The best thing about the Fairmont? The beds themselves. They were very comforting after a long day of traveling.";2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

We did get a really nice package deal, the romance package that included a bottle of sparkling wine, a chocolate fondue, and breakfast for 2 the next morning with late checkout.

Pros: Beautiful modern lobby, extremely comfortable beds (I slept SO well and woke with no aches), and immaculately clean rooms.  New carpet and linens.  Extremely friendly service at the front desk, and check-in was a breeze. In addition to the standard bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner, they give you a travel size toothpaste.  Gotta take pleasure in the little things, right? :) Cons: Expensive parking - but if you're like me and not willing to pay $35+ per night, you can find free street parking a few blocks away, on the west side of McCormick place.  For a 4-star hotel, the room decor was pretty lackluster, the furnishings were updated, but not such that I felt like I was in a 4-star hotel.  No bathrobes, no showercap, no bath mat, no tea bags, no fridge, no complimentary high speed internet.  Poor TV channel selections, and though we're pretty tech-savvy, it was impossible to figure out how to order a movie (although the girl at the desk mentioned we could do that and charge it to the room).  When we checked in, I asked the girl at the front desk if we could get a room with a view of the city, and she did manage to get us up pretty high (17th floor) but on the south side of the building, so all we had was a view of McCormick place and a little bit of lake, really.  My husband and I noticed on our way out that most rooms on the north side probably don't have a good city view anymore, because there is a new building being constructed right next to this one blocking the skyline. Overall, the Hyatt Regency just doesn't seem to be my flavor of hotel.  I'm sure it's perfect for the business traveler attending a convention at McCormick, but I wouldn't dare pay retail price for it and I probably won't recommend it to my friends if they were visiting Chicago.   Hint: Get good at Priceline's 'name your own price'...

597;9/26/2012;NlMJYvvbTIhoRzEd1AmsTw;Quazn4nNfdqnFIJagiAfcA;"On Sept 4, I made a reservation for 2 nights at the Hyatt McCormick Place in Chicago. I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me ""It is what it is."" Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.";1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

You can insert/extract them slowly, medium speed, fast, ultra-fast and it's hit-or-miss on getting it to unlock the door. Same problem with both my card-keys, other folks were having the same problem which led to a lot of knocking noises at all hours. People would keep trying to get into their rooms or they would knock if someone was already in the room so they wouldn't have to use the key. The a/c is a bit touchy and makes the room either ice cold or super toasty, you have to keep adjusting it as the temperature isn't constant. Rooms are a bit dark and needs more lighting, the closet is in the shadows with no light. The bedside clock/radio has both an iPod/iPhone dock and a USB port which is very handy to recharge things. Only one outlet on the desk lamp so you'll have to crawl under the desk to plug-in something else or you can plug something on the other side of the room. The WiFi is free but has a 200MB data cap for a single device, if you want unlimited data it's an extra charge. This is the standard Hyatt data plan, also if you go for the premium data package ($15 extra/day) make sure you do it over WiFi so you can use up to 3 devices for that package. If you use the ethernet jack you will be limited to that specific jacked-in device. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere if you want to puchase things like food or other things. There are 4 places to eat in the hotel with the cafe being the most convenient option selling cold deli sandwiches, chips, drinks, beer, Chicago dogs, etc. I didn't eat at the restaurants. Little coffeemaker in the room with complimentary coffee/tea and housekeeping staff is very good about keeping it well stocked if you use supplies. Front desk staff is friendly, bellmen and other staff members are all friendly and helpful so they do have a good crew from what I experienced. Bathroom was fine, the bath mat towel on one day was frayed and torn with a faded nasty looking stain on it. Complimentary toothpaste is nice, the glasses for water are ridiculously fancy and on the small side so if you use them to pour a drink on ice you'll be refilling it a lot. Had a conference at the exhibit hall which is across the street from the hotel (there are a couple of enclosed bridges connecting the hotel to the exhibition hall for use during bad weather, just walk at street level in nice weather as it's faster). For the amount of money paid the value isn't really there. The exhibition hall venue was a bit disappointing and though it's not the hotel I thought I should mention it: No soap in bathroom dispensers, late coffee service for our workshops everyday, freezing cold venue, slow food service catered through the hotel (they kept running out of food, didn't have enough tables/chairs). The good part about the venue is it's fairly easy to find an outlet to charge laptops, free WiFi.";2;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

The room itself was average at best, definitely not worth the price. The staff aren't great either. The front desk staff are rude. The restaurant staff are inept. If you're visiting Chicago and your company isn't putting you up here, don't stay here.

First of all I was staying here for the Chicago 1/2 marathon this past August. I stayed here last year and didn't have this many problems until this stay. First of all, they let you check in early online which is nice and then print out this barcode that you can scan at their kiosk near the front counter to get your room keys.  When I got there NONE of the 4 kiosks were working.  When I went to stand in the LONG line (which is why I checked in online to avoid this) the front desk attendant told me that i should check all the kiosks. I said NONE of them are working, shouldn't you know this?  They didn't have a clue what was going on. Second, right near the breakfast/starbucks area to get coffee smelled of BO! It was horrendous. It smelled like that last year and it was worse this time. How can they NOT do something about that. It was just disgusting. You felt like you wanted to throw up Thirdly, at around 4am we heard drunk guys outside our hallway screaming obscenities at either other for about a half hour. It woke us all up and we were trying to get a good night sleep for our race the next day.   Finally, you have to pay for parking, which we get. BUT it was a hassle leaving b/c they were so congested and the scanner thing wasn't working on the way out so we had to wait for assistance. I received  a survey from the Hyatt asking how my stay was. Well I filled it out and let them know I wasn't happy with things and will not be staying there ever again due to all the issues we had. Guess what? I NEVER heard back from their management. Disappointed that they do not care to better their services and keep customers coming back.

One time, I hadn't slept in three days and was looking down at my phone while walking, so I even saw the ladies room. It smelled like roses. As someone who travels a lot, the single most important thing to me is service. You get used to the TSA, you can live with bad food, but the last thing you want is someone pissing you off or not meeting your expectations. This Hyatt consistently went above and beyond and earned every one of their five stars. What's good? Very nice building/rooms, amazing view, incredibly friendly staff, easy taxi access, nice gym, and pretty good food. What could use work? The prices are tough - room service is overpriced, and if you aren't a Diamond member, wifi could get expensive. Also, although it's extremely close to downtown, it's not quite walkable, and there isn't much directly surrounding the hotel. Staying there as much as I did, it was like being at home. 99% of the time everything was perfect (I even got scotch and cake on my birthday). What mattered more, though, was that when things weren't right, like a messed up reservation or loud neighbors, they were taken care of immediately. The Hyatt O'Hare is a slightly more modern hotel (less convention-y) but I stay here whenever I can. I saw the staff do extraordinary things for people time and time again, so I know this wasn't all because I stayed there so much. I'm actually coming back in August with some friends just to visit.

It's out of the way of downtown and, although the Chinatown L stop is only a few short blocks away, it's doesn't seem like a safe walk after dark or for a female walking solo (like me!). I did like that I was upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and that they had a boarding pass printing station in the lobby. The free WiFi was hit or miss; you literally had to be a few feet from the lobby to get a good signal. Not a major issue for me, but if you're traveling on business it might be good to know.

For gym enthusiasts: free towels, including chilled ones - free headphones, free water, music playing, TVs on, tons of cardio machines, free weights, jump ropes, resistance bands, medicine balls, balance balls, a full range of ROM weight machines, roman chair, etc. - really - AMAZING. The locker rooms have lockers, showers, sauna!! The pool is silly, it's more of a kiddie pool than anything, but the gym is 24 hours, so that's a huge plus. There aren't a million TV channels, and the internet is for-cost but those weren't material to us. It would've been nice to access the internet for questions about where to go to dinner, but the concierge was more than helpful about that. The hotel has really thin walls, we travel with a sound machine, but I could still hear TV in other rooms at 4am - lots of doors opening/closing late at night in the hall, too. Toiletries were above average and nice smelling. Plenty of towels. Room included iron, hairdryer (on closet shelf), bible, chairs, floorspace, mirror, bench. The split bathroom was nice for people traveling with more than one person. Temperature in the hotel was just fine for us, perfect for sleeping. For-cost amenities are over-priced, but we avoided them by bringing out own snacks/drinks and eating elsewhere. I would stay here again!";4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

Trying to contact a helpful person at this hotel is like pulling teeth.  I called to see what needed to be done to get welcome gifts placed in each guests room (about 10 guests).  I was transferred around on the phone a total of 6 times and still no one could answer my question.  I was told a manager would call me about it later---never got that call. Once I finally did get answers to my questions, I dropped the gifts off on a Friday to be placed in guests rooms over the weekend (I gave clear instructions to the manager with a list of full names)  She assured me that they would get these gifts in the room (mind you its $3 per drop off). I called on Monday to confirm the drop offs.  First time I called and asked I was placed on hold for 15 minutes.  I ended up hanging up, calling back and spoke to the same manager I left instructions with on friday---nope, no drop offs---and no explanation. So I had to go into bitch mode, to make sure these gifts were delivered ASAP (she actually asked me ""when would you like me to get them to their rooms?"" I wanted to scream: YESTERDAY!) Is it just me or shouldn't a hotel have exceptional customer service--atleast a hotel at the Hyatt level?  Very disappointing.";1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

Room Window opened 5 inches-good by today's standards. Air conditioning was adequate through the night. (some hotels cut down on AC late at night) Only one front desk person was outstanding.  Two were rude. I rented two rooms, one for me, one for a friend.  In order to get to the room at night, if you have a rental car, you must pass your key card to get into the parking lot, pass it again to get into the elevator and again to get into your room. the key failed at one of the three key  points, on nearly every trip. At one point i had them make me three keys, and NONE worked.  my friend made through the three-key gauntlet only once without a front desk change of keys... other than that, the beds were great, room was clean. soaps were a little heavy--if  you want something unscented or not waxy bring your own.  All in all, a fine generic hotel experience with the usual chain store problems--no one in the hotel seemed to take responsibility for the issues.";4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

Some things I really loved and appreciated: The room: -L'occitane bath products, the amazingly comfortable pillow top bed, the humongous windows, temperature control, beautiful bathroom, and a waiting bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries to welcome us!   -The window drapes totally block out any bit of light which leads to amazing sleep. -Also appreciated the phone in the bathroom (which actually came in handy once when I needed to call down but didn't want to wake up my boyfriend), turn-down service which comes with bottled water, a wonderful view of the city.   -He also asked to have chocolate cake sent up to celebrate my birthday and what arrived at 8:30 on the dot was an amazing chocolate cupcake complete with candles, matches, and a bottle of Evian to enjoy. The hotel: -The lobby is gorgeous, with crystal chandeliers and a fountain and a jazz band playing in the evening.   -The service was super nice.  I actually had a cold and needed some Advil, and called down late to see if the gift shop was still open.  They asked me to come down to the front desk, where I was asked if I was looking for medication (indeed I was) and offered a tray of options.  Cost $9 but was totally needed and I'm glad I didn't have to make a late-night run to find a convenience store. -Also each time you call the operator for help they call you by your name which is a nice touch. -Attached to Water Tower which was great for a little shopping I had been meaning to catch up on. Some random things that could be better, but are not enough of a big deal to change the rating from 5 to 4 stars: -You have to take to sets of elevators to get to your room, and the elevators are a little small so sometimes you have to wait a little -Although my boyfriend added my name to the room (we checked in separately)--when I arrived I was treated a little like I was trying to sneak in or something, and it's interesting how the service is for a customer vs. a potential customer.  Very mild difference, but definitely different.   -There is a way to plug in your Iphone/Ipod into the TV to play music--however it is cumbersome (you have to download and sign up for this app called LodgeNet Mobile) and it takes a bit of time, and even then I couldn't figure out how to use it. -The wifi is free but not that good, actually turned it off and used my 3G network which worked a lot better.

Coming from a Chicagoan, the location of the hotel could not be any more central; it's steps from all the major spots in the city. The lobby at the Ritz is lovely, but getting there can be a bit confusing as it isn't actually on the ground floor. I had my car valet parked (the prices are much higher than any garage), and then I was instructed to take the elevators to the 12th floor. Once I arrived, we went to the cafe for drinks. I had some of the best cappuccino I have ever had. I have no idea what it cost, but they were made with good espresso and had proper foam. I don't think I judge anything harsher in life than cappuccinos, haha, so if I say it was good, it was GOOD! They are 1/3 of a Starbucks tall (read: size of a real capp in Europe) but so good that I savoured every molecule vs. the mammoth Starbucks size which I gulp down in a few minutes. If it was $4-5, I would gladly pay that here because, although a fraction of the size, the quality was worth it. It also came with a wonderful biscotti that had cranberries in it, I believe.. Yum. Just yum. Our tray of pistachios was constantly replenished as were glasses of water; the servers were very attentive. There is also free Wi-Fi. My only complaint would be that there is no bathroom at the bottom. I didn't realize that I had to go until I was waiting for my car, and from there I discovered that I would either have to go back to the 12th-floor lobby or up to the food court at neighboring Water Tower.

Classic moldings, gorgeous floral arrangements (although I am pretty sure the orchids are fake), and picture perfect seating arrangements makes the lobby a great place for a drink, a date or afternoon tea with friends. I had a dirty vodka martini and my friend had the toasted almond martini... both were delicious.  Service was excellent, very attentive :)  I like that. What I love most about this place is that it's not a place to be seen. Just an elegant setting with great ambiance and service. I'll update the review when I stay at the hotel.";4;8;5;4;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
660;8/27/2010;iiektqngqcr1l3DVsaXouA;mHPauyLvuuPLXRUXvzi7tQ;"This hotel has the most beautiful lobby in all of Chicago.  Guaranteed.  I know because we visited every darn hotel in downtown Chicago looking for the best lobby to take wedding photos in.  This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight.  Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too!  We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city.  It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos....  And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night.  I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.";5;3;3;3;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
661;9/17/2008;H5t9;0R5mhF_e9pf8ko5g8IHBqQ;"This review is for afternoon tea only. My Mom and I love afternoon tea. We go whenever possible no matter what city we're in and usually the Ritz no matter the city is outstanding. It's usually a safe bet for excellent service and quality. Not so here. Now, I'm familiar with the Chicago Ritz. I've dined here many times for dinner and the greenhouse room is a gorgeous place to stop by for a drink (pink champagne is a must). But the tea? Expensive? Yes. Worth it? No way. So disappointing! Everything had been pre-done the night or days before and then must have sat in a refrigerator. It tasted like it too. It had that old food taste. And not just the soggy and stale sandwiches. Everything tasted old. My Mom thinks now that her salmon turned. She later complained of a stomach ache from something but we're not too sure what got her ill there. I probably dodged that bullet because after my one bite of turkey that tasted day old or older I was done with the sandwich portion. My poor Mom felt better the next day but had a bad night. So it was sort of like bad icing on a really nasty cake. There was nothing fresh. Even the scones seemed nuked and were cold in places rather than being recently baked. The rolls seemed pre-done somewhere else. And who eats a cold roll with hot tea? The tea was fair. I'm something of a tea snob and would guess they're buying in massive bulk at a cheap price. It's not Mariage Frères or anything high quality by any stretch of the imagination--but they'll charge you like it is. They treat their teas badly too. They plunked the green and the black teas down on our table at the same high temperatures and then let the leaves sit the entire hour we were there meaning the last cup of tea had turned bitter by then. It's like they filled the pots from the red spigot by the industrial coffee maker. This is not how tea has ever been served to us at any other Ritzes before. Each tea has it's own temperature and time. Usually this is completely respected and every attention is paid to the finest of details. Uh...not here. Add to that not one of the three servers working the entire room could give us any help in tea selection. We each said what types of teas we enjoyed and asked them to recommend some things and the servers went and asked each other before deciding they couldn't ""decide for us"" Huh? Hoookay...... I asked for milk for my tea (East coast girls don't do cream XD) and it took over twenty minutes for the milk to arrive. The ONE time tea was poured for us (the first), (and the pots were HEAVY--too heavy for my  Mom so I had to pour for her the entire time) was when I was in the ladies room. I came out to find tepid tea waiting for me. I also couldn't find a server to help when my cup had a huge sharp chip on the rim. After ten minutes of looking around, I gave up and drank from the other side. Ridiculous to have to do that at $30+! One of our water glasses had someone else's old lipstick on the rim. Yuck. We kept asking each other is this the Ritz? Srsly? Ew. Pretty room. Bad service. Bad quality. Horrible after experience with my Mom getting ill. Next time I'll try somewhere else. This is not worth it at all.";1;4;1;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

Since it was a minor inconvenience, the manager offered us 2 complimentary glasses of the Cabernet Sauvignon we were drinking.  I thought that was pretty nice...  I had the ""Four Storey Hill Farm Young Chicken, Yukon Gold Potato Purée, Baby Turnips, Crimini Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Jus"".  That was probably the most memorable restaurant chicken meal I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and had excellent flavor. Not too overpowering... The vegetables were perfect.   As we got to our room, our luggage was already set up for us.  I'm not going to blabber about the details in the room.  The pictures speak for themselves... That night, we attended a black tie event in the greenhouse area.  There was a live band, our own private ice sculpture at our table! And a gourmet buffet adorned with fresh sushi, rack of lamb, caviar, French breads and cheeses, oysters, and so much more.  It was a feast! The last night we were there, I also had tried the ""Butternut Squash Lasagna, Butternut Squash Purée, Ricotta Cheese, Walnuts, Spinach""  -absolutely amazing... If you don't mind spending some coin for a luxurious hotel stay, this is the place to go.  Excellent service, convenient, great location, right at the center of the Magnificent Mile.  And I almost forget to mention I'm one of those gals that like 'free' stuff. -ha...

The location, staff, and room service were all at a five star level but, sadly other aspects of our stay made us feel like this hotel is just not worth the price tag. Our room was a bit shabby, the mini bar looked to be on it's last leg and the carpet was coming up all along the edges of the room. While I was waiting for my husb to arrive, I tried to watch some TV. The cable service was terrible. Half the channels were out and it took about 3-5 seconds for the picture to appear when changing channels. There was also a slight error in our room service order (received decaf coffee instead of regular). We would have thought nothing of these small inconveniences had we been paying about $200 less for the room.  Next time we stay downtown we'll be doing  just that by booking a room somewhere else.";3;1;1;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

This was definitely not the case. My first impression basically sums up my experience here. My friend had picked me up at the airport and dropped me off because A) she's an awesome friend and B) I had just had knee surgery and had a full-leg brace and crutches and could barely walk, let alone manage my things. As we pull up to the hotel, NEITHER of the TWO BELLHOPS took one step towards us. Even after seeing me struggle to get out of the car, after watching me wrestle with my luggage (4 bags), and even after making eye contact with me, they didn't even flinch from their spots. I had to call them over before one of them reluctantly (and I could see it on his face) mosied his way towards me. MOSY?!? I can barely hold my purse and manage my crutches at the same time and this guy is MOSY-ING? It gets worse. He then proceeds to not say one word to us...no greeting, not apologies, nothing...and takes only ONE BAG! Did I mention I had FOUR? Before I could ask him to take the others, he was gone. In effort to keep this somewhat brief, let me list off the other terrible attributes of the stay: 1) after complaining to the front desk about the bellhop as I was checking in, she just stared at me blankly and gave a half-hearted apology. Nothing else was done. No comps, no speaking with the manager, nothing. 2) when checking in, she told me she no longer had king beds available and I would have to take a room with two doubles. That would be fine if I didn't have to sleep with a GIGANTIC BRACE on my leg with my husband next to me. Being that it was a romantic getaway, sleeping in separate beds was not the suggestion I wanted to hear from the front desk. 3) Although they moved us to a king room the next night, the second room had a constant yet intermittent rattle that would sound like someone knocking on our door. All. Throughout. The. Night. 4) They erroneously charged us for mini-bar items TWICE! Once upon checkout and then again when I just happened to check my credit card!!! What if I hadn't? I would've never known. 5) Lastly, when I called the front desk to challenge said mini-bar charge, they stated they would have someone from finance call me back. It has been over a week and I had to call them back myself. Never again will I stay at a Ritz Carlton. Not what I would've expected from such a reputable hotel. Truly disappointing and a waste of my money.";1;6;2;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

The lobby has marble floors, thick carpet, lots of pillars, a fountain and chandeliers which gives it a very grand look. After the check in with friendly staff i headed to my rooms.

But I have no choice when comparing my experience relative to my high expectations. To begin with, this particular Ritz can't seem to decide whether it's Pottery Barn or Roarin' 20s. Every time I walked from the 1920s bedroom area to the ultramodern bathroom it was like being sucked through a magical time warp. And yet, it took me literally 10 very annoying minutes to figure out how the ""ultramodern"" bathroom's shower worked because the valve's settings were all screwed up. And as for the 1920s aspect of the decor... it's just not my thing. I wouldn't downgrade the hotel by one star just because of that, but I'm just not a fan of the World War I era feel when I have the privilege of spending a few nights in the heart of downtown Chicago (which has quickly become one of my favorite cities in America, by the way). No other complaints whatsoever. The rooms are spacious. The views from my windows were awesome as they included both downtown and part of the lake. The service is top notch. The hotel is so fully-staffed that you can't walk 10 feet without finding someone to help you, which is nice because the hotel is so massive. I ate a few meals over 2 days inside the hotel and they were good (not excellent, but good). The location is of course perfect, if you want to be in the heart of downtown.

We had a standard room, which regularly goes for $190/night (although we had a Goupon for $89).  The room was spartan and small - the king size bed taking up nearly the entire floor space.  The bathroom has a tiny, uncomfortable toilet and the sliding door, while stylish, provides no privacy or sound dampening (hope you enjoy hearing everyone do their business).  The bed itself, however, was quite comfortable. If you forget anything (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc), the hotel has you covered - for prices that would make the mafia proud.  No complimentary toiletry items here, but you can buy a toothbrush for $5 or toothpaste for $8 from the minibar.  WiFi is $10 per day, which I found to be rather ridiculous.  Free WiFi is standard these days in almost every coffee shop, yet at $200 hotel it is extra?

I found this place on http://hotels.com and it was the cheapest on a Friday ( considering it was a holiday weekend) and looked decent , and was across from the drake close to all the touristy things to do in Chicago. The downside is that we drove from Milwaukee and parking in Chicago is atrocious enough as it is but the hotels valet service costs $50-ish bucks and I was not happy about that. The good thing is there is a parking garage LITERALLY across the street that is only $35.. you can't take your car in and out though and that's only for 24 hours. SO we did that, problem solved. Deets on the Digs: Presumably re-vamped recently, outside of the rooms were kinda run down, I don't know if they pay attention to these things but door frames and floor boards were filthy and in need of a good coat of paint. The elevator was terrifying. I mean, talk about a death box. I am claustrophobic enough as it is but I could barely move with all our luggage. I overlooked these things because of the price and location and then get into the room and it is small but very luxurious. I read others reviews here about the showers and laughed because there's instructions IN the shower on how to use them and I have to say I don't think I've taken that many showers in a 24 hour period, ever. I loved it. The marble in the bathroom echoed and it kinda made me self conscious about using the loo considering you could hear everything. I would suggest some kind of better rug or something in there that would muffle the noise. Also the toilet was confusing, The flusher was on the wall above the toilet and has two buttons that do the same thing. I guess it's a ""fancy"" thing I don't understand but I thought it was unnecessary The bed was AMAZING.. if not for the fact that we wanted to sight see I would have stayed in and slept. I was so comfortable in fact I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Our bed at home is now an utter disappointment. We ordered room service twice and I have to say it was quiet reasonable. We split pancakes in the morning and they were delicious. My boy got late night cheesecake the night before and because they were missing an ingredient they gave us two pieces! Quite nice.

This one failed to measure up in too many ways for me to return. I went up with a group this trip and we didn't request rooms near each other, they did offer us adjoining rooms so that was very nice except they never sent anyone up to unlock the interior door so we just swapped a key and had to go in and out in the hall. Not too big of a deal but maybe annoying for the rooms next to us hearing the doors slam over and over. The elevators were tiny and although there were 3 one was broken with the door stuck half open. I will agree the bathrooms have zero privacy with every sound clearly coming into the room. No-name shampoo/conditioner and soap was pretty boring. Was also sad about the $10/day wi-fi and I don't know how they can continue that $50/day parking when there are 2 lots within 5 minutes of them that are $25 and $30/day. The valet parking does have unlimited in and out while the other lots do not. We wanted to have a drink in the lobby hotel when we got back from our nightly entertainment but when we walked up they were removing the bottles of alcohol and storing them away for the night. As we stood there discussing if we wanted to try walking elsewhere, a lady came up and ordered a vodka tonic with lemon. He made a tonic with lemon instead of telling her they were closed so then when she tried to pay and he said No charge, she got all confused (this wasn't her first vodka tonic!) and kept demanding they add vodka. He was telling her to go to her room and add it from the mini bar but I think if he would've just said we are closed, I can give you the mixer and you add the vodka, right from the beginning, there would've been less of a scene. Also, in the morning as we came down on our way to breakfast, we stopped for 4 coffees to drink on the way and it was over $20. For 4 black coffees, no lattes, no espressos, just drip brew flavored water. Didn't guess that was the average price or we would've waited until breakfast!

In terms of customer service, however, it failed miserably for me and my students. I was there with 6 students of mine for a field trip to visit art museums. So as a group, we checked out 5 rooms. First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368?

It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger.  Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road.

The ballroom was beautifully done and impressive with its high ceilings and flowery viney gilt doohickeys all over (I'm sure there's an architectural term for this of which I'm just wholly ignorant). Although the '80s-/'90s-/Miami-Vice-inspired light-up dance floor was slightly incongruous with these flowery viney ceiling and wall decorations, the light-up dance floor was definitely WAY awesome when the (horrifically outdated and spectacularly BAD) DJ played ""Billie Jean,"" the highlight of my evening. Was the DJ that bad? Yes, he really was THAT bad. If I knew who he was, his review would make my Barnes & Noble review look like a feather floating in the wind. I did find it a little odd that the ballroom was a two-story setup such that there were twelve tables or so on the second floor, too. This seems like poor planning, and while it makes for a pretty room and more space for the hotel to rent out, it also makes for an inefficient means for the people seated up there to access the dance floor. ANYway, while the decor was generally pretty beautiful and slightly eclectic, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Granted, it was hotel food. I understand that. Unfortunately, it was reeeeeally bad hotel food. A three course meal (salad, entree, and dessert), the salad was the best of the three and that's mainly because it's probably really hard to mess up a basic salad as long as the greens are fresh. The chicken was bland and the deceptively rich-and-creamy-looking sauce was just that -- DECEIVING! The cheesecake (not on my list of favorite desserts in the first place) was oddly-textured. So disappointing. In the end, although the Drake would have apparently cost ~40% more for our tickets, I would happily have paid that amount because my experience with their food was in the past much more satisfying and the single-story layout is more conducive to cohesive group identity (i.e. being able to stumble onto the dance floor together without having to navigate any stairs).";3;4;1;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

We needed a rental car for the remainder of our trip, so we picked one up at O'Hare and made the drive here. Finding the hotel was pretty easy. The valet parking? I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast. Head there for a meal if you're staying at the Knickerbocker. You won't be disappointed.";4;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

Of utmost importance to me is noise & cleanliness, so I give this place a thumbs-up. The A/C is rather loud, which forces me to hit three stars instead of four -- but I must also add that the AC works quite well even so.   The breakfast buffet is better than most, and if you just want to take a couple of items to go (as I find to be most useful), they charge you very reasonable a la carte prices (well, as reasonable a hotel fare goes). Staff is courteous & helpful; service is prompt, and they have good in-room coffee for brewing.  I always consider that a plus as it enables me to be civil once I'm ready to go downstairs & use the biz center or get breakfast. If you want to get nitpicky, the gym doesn't have any floor mats. So what? It's clean and the equipment is modern and clean. The comfort, convenience and service make this a great bargain.

Cons: Internet was $10 per day One day we needed to use the internet from the ""office"". That was $20 per hour. If you have a car, parking is over $50 per day. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away. This deserved 3 1/2 stars.

Each and every person we came in contact with was polite and helpful at every turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better evening. All of my guest were in awe of the beautiful space, delicious food, and 5 star service.  As were hubby and I. The champagne parade was a big hit.  We loved it! My husband was concerned that having our reception at such a luxe location would make him and his family/friends feel uncomfortable or out of place. I assured him otherwise and after 5 minutes of arriving at the cocktail hour he realized there was nothing to worry about.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a waiter and he had champagne in our hands almost instantly. Since there were only about 10 minutes left in the cocktail hour the waiters went out of their way to pick bride and groom out of the crowd so that we could get a taste of the delicous appetizers. Mm-mmmm the mini beef wellington...who knew such a small piece could be so flavorful. The only 'hiccup' occured when we got to Parlor G where the bridesmaids were scheduled to get hair and make-up only to find that many of the outlets in the room weren't working. This was definitely a problem with the hair dryers, curling irons, etc that needed to be plugged in. But about 5 minutes after placing a call to the front desk a maintenance staffer was at the room with extension cords and a power strip to get us by.  Also the internet access is like something out of the '90s...why not just charge it to the room?

The bedding was very comfortable, the whirlpool tub was great, and the TVs were awesome (although barely used). We appreciated the use of the steamer for my dress, the free internet and the tray of fruits and champagne. We enjoyed the carolers and extra Holiday cheer in the lobby. It was a shame that the renovations were not able to be completed, though it is beautiful all the same. And everyone was very friendly to us. And, of course, the location is unbeatable. The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us. Thankfully, all was fine, and they were able to compensate us satisfactorily for the scare, although it took some work to get to that point.

You don't need dinner because of all the restaurants within walking distance you will want to try from the Cheesecake Factory to The Rosebud Steak House, etc. The breakfast menu is simple and delicious and fairly priced. We had breakfast for $80 with tip for four adults. The omelets were perfectly made and the contents fresh and perfectly sautéed. The oatmeal, my favorite, was made well and that means it was freshly made with attention to detail. The bacon was well cooked, but not burnt as I asked. One note, basic single rooms have one king sized bed in a smaller room. If you need two double beds or a larger room there will be an up charge of about $30 or more per night. Parking approaches $60 plus tips for the door man so it is not recommended you stay here if you have a car to park.

Thanks to Chicago's crappy zoning regulations, one thing that's really a shame and will change Omni forever is the Ritz-Carlton.  Ritz-Carlton is building a massive hotel just to the South of Omni.  I mean there may be 6 inches if that between these hotels and the Ritz extends just a about 4 feet closer to Michigan completely ruining the South view and corner room views Omni had on Michigan.  What were once top rate, top price rooms, are now the worst rooms in the hotel.  What a bummer.  Omni can't be happy.

Although we had three government ID's the hotel was only able to give us two rooms at the governemnt employee rate. They said this was due to the hotel being sold out and so there were no more discount rates avaliable? This did not make any sense. We stayed for 6 nights and 7 days. Never once was the room service the same. One night they would turn dow the bed all the way, the next just take the pillows off, the next they would hide the pillows in the closet.... It was weird. The hotel offers a Select Guest program, which we signed up for before even going to Chicago. When we got there the check-in staff did not mention it at all, we had to bring it up. With the beverage program, as a part of the select guest thing: I would mark for them to knock and bring in our drinks, but the only time it was brought in was the day that I ask for it to be left out..... so strange. The selecet guest program stated that the hotel had a pillow bar, you could pick a feather pillow or a foam pillow. We ask for feather but never got it. We ask a couple of times. The select guest program stated it included a nightly treat and a bottle of water, yet we never got either brought to the room. The internet did not work half the time and we needed the internet as we had to work while we were on vacation. Elevators were weird, you couldn't even take the stairs if you wanted to....who does that? The billing was really weird as well. They charged our credit card 1800 dollars when we checked in and then when we reviewed out billing statment when we were leaving we noticed that they charged us for the internet that we were told was free so they had to go back and credit us. Then it took about a week for the internet charges to be credited. This type of billing caused the fraud department on everyones credit cards to shut down the cards until we called to get things fixed ..... a hassel that could have been avoided had Omni charged per night or at the end of our stay. The location was nice, but we felt like we still had a long way to go for most things, other than shopping. Although this used to be the hotel that Oprah used, it looked more like something Jerry Springer would use. Overall it was just a plain old hotel.

All those times I complained about having to go further than 2 miles from the area I was missing out on so much outside of what tourism has become of Chicago. One take on the Architecture Tour will show you all the other neighborhoods you're missing out on. Regardless, the Omni is nice, high class, great accommodations and very attentive staff. In most cities it's one of the best hotels and in Chicago it's no different although I make a convincing argument for some great boutiques I've had a chance to stay with.

I spoke with their CS Rep online and wasn't given any remedy to make it right. Worst customer service call experience I ever had. Finally, the hotel manager offered a consolation to the misunderstanding. Before you book, also, make sure you save up for their Guest Rewards Programn, which entitles you to several freebies. The rooms are SWANKY! Very nice indeed. Modern furniture and the bed will make you just want to sink in it and never get up. Heck, you even get ROBES! The restaurant they have there is nice. Nice decor, decent food....but pricey. But hey, let's face it, if you're staying here, you're obviously not broke. Hotel staff is generally very helpful in anything you need, so don't be afraid to ask them. I had all my requests taken care of. It's prime location for all your shopping needs. My SO (Significant Other) was pleased with the location and was poised to make this spot for our stay as it is so close to so many retail stores. Downers about this place? The access to the lobby and elevators. They are on the 2nd floor which requires an elevator to get to. It's weird. Also, I'd like better customer service. Mine wasn't bad....but I've had better.

(but it's not free, boo) cons: 1. kind of a weird floor plan. you walk in, you take the elevator up to the 3rd floor (where the main lobby is), and then from there you can take an elevator up to your rooms. why not just have an elevator on the street that accesses rooms using room keys? 2. this really isn't a con, but i found this to be perplexing. the bathroom is huge. and there is only one tiny trash can, and it's against the far wall by the toilet. i would move the trash can so it would be more central, and every day, house keeping would move it back by the toilet. 3. the mini fridge is kind of small.  thankfully i'm the master of rearranging fridges to make things, like my cupcakes from more and my leftover gino's east pizza, fit in there.

It trends toward new-money opulence--modern but luxe (I'm thinking of this in comparison to, say, the SF Fairmont, which feels like walking into Buckingham bloody Palace). My pals managed to get a suite with two double beds they seemed to love, plus deluxe bathroom, and separate parlor, which is awesome and, apparently, standard. Genius. Combined with great location--right on the Mag Mile!--it would make for a super shopping weekend or even a nice base of operations for any of the many summer festivals and events. Also, you needn't fear shoddy cleanup service. Housekeeping is very diligent. When my friends decided they'd rather stay in and skip the housekeeping, the response was: ""What?

I would suggest upgrading to a room with a ""City View"" as the standard rooms all face surrounding buildings and you'll feel like you're in a prison block. The suites also have a couple large TVs (over 40 inches maybe?). Since I'm an unapologetic snob at times, I greatly appreciated the old fashion turn down service (for those of us who are too lazy to pull back our own bed covers and lay out our own robe before bed).

It's a beautiful hotel, although the lobby/reception is technically on the 3rd floor so you have to take 2 elevators to get to your hotel room.  Not a biggie but during busy times, you'll wait a long time for an elevator.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated and very clean.  No bed bugs issues either!  LOL.  Bed was pretty comfortable.  Bath amenities are nothing to write home about, but it is a clean, decent bathroom.   We had room 1118, and it is a bit of a bizarre L-shaped room.  Didn't really seem like a suite to me, and the bed didn't seem separate from the living area space.  it wasn't a huge room as some other reviewers reported and we only had one flat screen TV, so maybe we didn't get a true suite.  But it is still a nice room.  hey have a nice turn-down service, too.  But maybe we got 1118 because that's the Priceline special. Only two complaints I have are these:  (1) Parking (valet) costs $49.  There goes the bargain we got on Priceline. (2) The bed in 1118 shares the same wall as the bathroom in the next room.  So whenever the people in the next room go to the bathroom or turn on their shower, that noise blares in your ear.  Loud as hell.  Every time they ran their shower or used the toilet, we heard them.  Also, there is a hell of a lot of door slamming.  Too bad they can't do something to soften the sound of the door.";4;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

I know the area well and the hotel is definitely centrally located, walking distance to John Hancock, great stores and dining, and Millennium Park. It also appealed to me because all rooms are suites (which I assumed meant spacious) and the hotel has a pool. They assigned her a room on the 12th floor which had a horrific view of the building next door. Had I known it would be THAT bad, I would have definitely paid the extra $30 to get the room with a city view. I'm talking seal the window with bricks bad view. The living room area did not have a sofa but instead two armchairs, one of which did not have an accompanying ottoman. Website pictures made it look large and spacious but in reality that was not the case. Bedroom area was really good with enormous comfortable bed. Amenities: -Pool area was mediocre and filled with children when I went to take a look. -Also, the hotel has a complimentary car that guests can book during weekday business hours. A car was booked to take my mom to brunch - it was running late and she had to stand waiting with a friend on the ground floor area which had no seating. Her friend asked if they could just call them when the cab arrived while they waited in the seating area on the 3rd floor lobby. Hotel staff said they could not and admitted other guests had requested this service in the past. If the car booked is running late (fault of hotel) then it seems this is not too much to ask?

772;4/15/2012;UsbGD5IsBYksJUtXwVpihA;7t-rkbaAItmAyFDeLEI2Fg;"The location is prime. That's one of the biggest things you look for in a hotel when visiting a city for the first time. If you have never been to Chicago & are unsure of what area to stay in (as I was), don't worry, just go with Hotel 71. It is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. If you go right, you'll hit Millennium Park in 5 minutes. If you go left, you'll hit the start of The Magnificent Mile in about 5 minutes. The further down Michigan you walk, the more upscale the shops become. So yes, the location is prime. However, there are still some negative points worth noting. We stayed in room 2414; it is a corner room with magnificent views. It was also very cold, being as it is April. We blasted our heater full blast, but for the life of us, we could not get warm. I was beginning to think something was wrong with US, until I called the front desk to have someone take a look at our TV because it wasn't turning on. When the repairman came, he fixed the TV and I told him about our heater. Well, he fixed the heater, but then the cold air wouldn't work. Why do we need the cold air after I was just saying how cold we were? Well, we had the corner room with magnificent views, right? Which meant, windows around 3/4 of the room. Although it was cold and windy out, the sun was still shining, so when we would come back to our room in the afternoon, IT WAS BAKING HOT. The windows do not open out (& rightly so, as it is the 24th floor), but with the AC not working either, we had to close the curtains for some relief, which sucked because we did have such a beautiful view. There is a mini fridge under the TV. Perfect for keeping our water cold. It came in handy, too, for our leftover deep dish pizza. But when I called room service to ask for a set of utensils, they refused, saying that they can only bring me utensils if I ordered room service. Well then, why did you give me a damn fridge in the first place? I suggest that any hotel that gives you a fridge in your room should be willing to heat up your leftovers & supply you with utensils. It only makes sense, does it not? Valet is $49 a night. I didn't rent a car, so this didn't bother me, but still, that's a lot, City prices, I guess. What was annoying about checking in though was the nightly incidental charge. I prepaid through Expedia and then called the hotel directly to ask if they required a deposit for incidentals. They told me no. I specifically asked and again they said NO. Upon check in, the front desk tells me there is a deposit of $220, which came out to something like $70 a night. He tells me he cannot take cash for it, it must be put on a credit card. This was incredibly annoying because I did not account for an extra $220 in my travel budget. The clerk kept calling it a ""hold"" but come on friend, let's call it what it is - a fully refundable deposit, granted you do not order room service. Unless you want a fork, in which case you'd have to order room service. Blah. And how come the doorman doesn't open the door??? This is the ONLY hotel I have stayed in where the doorman doesn't open the door. If I have to open my own door, it's because there is NO DOORMAN. They don't even say HI or WELCOME BACK whenever we came back to the hotel. Maybe Hotel 71 should stop by a Kimpton hotel & see how they do things. There's one across the street... But location is prime & the views were magnificent. Free wi-fi, although it was spotty & only seemed to work in the bathroom, but we learn how to pick our battles, I guess..";4;3;0;2;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

My family and I stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend because we had a wedding to attend down the street. A bit pricey, but since almost every room was literally booked downtown that weekend, we decided to go for it.  It was a great decision mostly because we didn't have to drive back and forth between the burbs and city, and the fact that we felt super fancy having an awesome view of the river and Trump Tower. The hotel staff were all very accommodating, and really made us feel welcome.

How nice! The restaurant attached, Hoyt's, is pretty good.  They have a really great mac & cheese with bacon and truffle oil (yum!)  And as a bonus, the bar is open till 2am - which was nice for the wedding party :) We also had the rehearsal dinner here.  I worked with their catering manager, Rebecca, during the whole planning process and she was just wonderful.  She bore with me as I planned remotely, sending runners in to check out the space, and working with me to make the menu exactly what I wanted.  We originally had planned to have it on the 6th floor in one of their newly renovated spaces (which are very nice).  A few days before the event I got a call from her saying that the ballroom space was open and would we like to upgrade...no charge.  The views from the ballroom were absolutely amazing and it made for an unforgettable dinner with all the people who are closest to us! We had an absolutely amazing experience at Hotel 71.  The rooms themselves, the view and especially the service were above and beyond what I could have expected.  I'll never stay at another downtown hotel if I can help it!";5;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it.

The room was HUGEE (for comparison, it was about the same size or even slightly bigger than our 1 bedroom suite at the Intercontinental Chicago). The furnishing was relatively nice too, MUCH better than I anticipated (no ugly yellow checker-board pattern to my delight!) The only minus that prevents this from getting a 5 star is the horribly worn out bathroom. Our room was pleasant, but our bathroom was not. It's extremely old and worn out. Pro: VERY spacious room. You would not find a room this big ANYWHERE in Chicago for this price point. Con: Furnishing may not be up-to-par with other boutique hotels, but I personally think that the very spacious room easily makes up for that. It really comes down to decor VS. space.

The Groupon advised that we not call until the next day to book it.  Fine.  I called around 9:30.  The woman who answered was very rude and already flustered sounding.  So far we weren't off to a good start.   Then about a week later I have a charge on my credit card from Hotel 71 for $250!  In a panic I call and find out the woman had booked my date incorrectly and we were charged the no show fee.  With barely an apology it was refunded - which as everyone knows takes a few days to clear back onto your card.  Lovely when you're paying vendors left and right for wedding stuff.   The week before I called to verify we actually still had a room and we did, so so far so good I suppose. Day of wedding we arrive exhausted around 10:45p.  The front desk staff were super duper friendly and even went out of their way to go find a cork screw for us to open our bottle of wine the caterer had stashed away for us to take!   The room itself was eew.  Leopard print chaise lounge you didn't want to touch.  I didn't sleep a wink that night the bed was so uncomfortable - and considering how exhausted from the whole week of events leading up to the wedding, this was BAD.  I ended up watching the sun come up through the windows of the buildings across the river.  It was bad.   Again though, the staff was super sweet and friendly when we left!  The one redeeming quality about this place were the kind ones working - except for the icky woman on the phone.

Ok, that said, there were just a couple other things that I would have liked different.  For example, they had a coffee maker in the room and gave us coffee packets but no sugar or cream, not even powdered.  The shower had absolutely no water pressure, so it took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  And the hallways were really dismal and depressing looking.  There is also a huge gap between the room door and the hallway, so you might want to put a towel or something down to block out some of the voices, because you can hear every word spoken. I was also disappointed that there was no restaurant/bar in the lobby.  It is actually being renovated, but I knew that before we went on the trip by reading yelp reviews.  :)  They made up for it however, by rolling out a large cart (not as tacky as it sounds) and serving drinks in the lobby.

It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right. If you're not a chain hotel points whore or some super high maintenance jerk,  you should have no problem staying here.";4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

We got to the hotel, and we were actually able to check in about 4 hours before the 3pm check in time, which a huge positive! The space of the room was ok. Nothing special, definitely not boutique-like, as I was hoping it would be. The interior reminded me more of a Holiday Inn than of a hotel that...well, charges as much as this one does. The room size was perfect, even roomy I would say, for 2 adults, while the bathroom size was pretty standard. I know there are some complaints about the elevators, but we were on the 28th floor and had no problem at all. From the lobby, we actually didn't have to wait for one the whole time we were there, and anytime we needed one from our floor, we didn't wait longer than a minute. My biggest complaint was that every single night we stayed there (3 in total), I was woken up by noise in the hallway. Once from noisy elevator traffic and the other two times from a group of drunken girls yelling on the floor. As an NYC native, I have no problem sleeping through noise, and I actually brought/slept with earplugs in all nights, so I think this is really a testament to how thin the doors are. My only other big issue was that the bed was quite uncomfortable. I mean, when I'm traveling, I'm really paying for two things: a bed and good nights sleep; and this hotel couldn't meet either of those. Lucky for them, their location bumped up their rating from 1 star to 3. In all, if you can get a good deal on hotel71, then it might be worth the stay here. If you are a tourist like I was, it more than likely is worth the stay. If you end up having to pay full price, you may be disappointed.  Oh, and if you do end up booking some nights here, make sure to request a room on one of the higher floors.";3;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Service was also lacking.  The bar was small and indescript.  There was no ice bucket in the room and we had to call down for one.  And though the hotel seemed far from full, we were given a room RIGHT NEXT to the elevator.

Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite.

845;6/5/2012;Dse;jqp5BEMzEUIWTCt6pezS2Q;"I needed a hotel that was a little less spendy than the $200+ rack rate of the conference hotel (and yes, that was with the conference ""deal.""). Luckily for me, my travel agent (aka the bf) found Hotel Allegro, which was a mile away, for less than 50% of what I would have spent if I had stayed at the conference hotel. Yes, this is less than their advertised rack rate. I have a great travel agent. Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton hotel and after my experience, I must say I'm a fan. A complimentary wine hour (5-6 pm) every day? Don't mind if I do. In the afternoon, chilled water with slices of lemon and lime and either lemonade or a tea spritzer are available for you to quaff after walking around under the blistering sun. In the morning, coffee (hot and iced) and tea, along with a myriad of newspapers (by the way, you can get a paper delivered to your door gratuit), are awaiting you. Hotel lobbies are usually such dead spaces, but here, they're a lively and yet tranquil place for hotel guests to sit and relax. The only drawback is that the morning coffee is of Yale Club quality* (http://www.yelp.com/user…). The room was sumptuous and comfortable. After joining some hotel program, I had all the free wifi I wanted. The maid was scrupulously honest. I left some money as a tip for her (labeled in an envelope ""for the maid""), and when I came back, the money was left untouched because I guess she couldn't read English (I read somewhere that this was not uncommon). So the next day, I left the envelope on the bed where it was clear that the money was intended for her. The rest of the staff was also very courteous and accommodating. I had a lovely stay at Hotel Allegro and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. *If you can't be bothered to read my review, it means that the coffee is extremely weak and watered down.";4;4;2;2;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The area that the cocktail hour was held felt a bit crammed, but it was cozy. Since people were not sitting on the couches, they were just getting in the way. If possible I would suggest for them to move the couches around a little for the cocktail hour so there is more standing room and less of moving through a maze....

I am always in the lookout for a better pillow, I might actually email the hotel and ask what brand pillows they have so I can purchase some for my home!

The Bad:   The room was fairly small. Disappointing.  The desk and bathroom tops were not very clean - they were full of stains.  The biggest annoyance during my stay was how thin the walls were.  I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word.  I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is  $160+ a night.  Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room.  Nice. (not really)   Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive.  The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm.  Nice.   There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink).  Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more.  Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal.  For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room.  If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.";3;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
860;10/11/2011;SnbI949-yceutL9KH2d0ZA;woZhhAj9QrzMYBJ8M7uJFA;"Hello Chicago! On my 1st ever visit to Chicago I stayed 3 days/ 2 nights with the girlfriend at Hotel Allegro. She was there for work so I tagged along since I'd never been to Chicago. Hotel Allegro has a prime location in the Loop & was only a short walk after getting off the CTA Blue Line. The lobby & common areas of Hotel Allegro are grandly & sharply dressed. The girlfriend & I arrived early morning so our room wasn't ready yet. Front desk service was thoughtful as they offered to stow our luggage & call us as soon as our room was ready. Free coffee, tea, etc is available in the lobby in the morning. We grabbed coffees & set out for some breakfast & exploration while our room was prepped. The call came while we were still eating breakfast. That was fast. Back at the hotel, service continued to be thoughtful as staff confirmed that the girlfriend was on an extended business stay & made sure she had a quiet room high enough from the street, on the corner & away from the elevator. The room itself was clean, smartly decorated & felt like it had been recently renovated, but smelled faintly of paint. Being a Queen Deluxe room, it was on the small side. While it had all the basic amenities, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room if you're signed up with Kimpton's Loyalty Program. No problem. I see this as a better option than paying $10 - $20 for 24 hours of internet access. So I signed up, got free Wi-Fi & Kimpton has since been nice enough to not assault my email inbox with loads of junk. For my 1st time in Chicago, Hotel Allegro was a great place to stay. It's a hotel that's been deftly redone, is centrally located, pays particular attention to service & has nice but smallish rooms. Any future trip to Chicago may also include a stay at Hotel Allegro.";4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
861;10/15/2011;9vH;9unR5cAeDx1CPtKH2Hctfw;"Stayed here for a girls weekend because we got a great rate.  Location was very good.  We could walk to most of the Chicago tourist attractions.  The decor is modern and cool.  The rooms are tiny - I'd guess because it's a historic building - and there's no ventilation in the bathroom so everything stays wet all day.  There's also no coffee maker in the room, because they have coffee service in the lobby every morning.  They could use to update the elevator systems.  They're extremely slow and everyone lines up to cram into a car because they'd rather be up against someone else than wait another 10 minutes for the next one to come along.  A plus is the complimentary wine in the lobby every afternoon.  Overall we had a good stay, but I do think the quality doesn't quite live up to the price. Oh, and sign up for Kimpton preferred guest program (free) to access free wifi.";3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Parking was only (ha) $36 for the night I was researching places to stay in Chicago for a good week before deciding on Hotel Allegro. It was nice they weren't charging the $50-100 pet fee other hotels in the area seem to think is normal. Also, they didn't have a size restriction. Our dog isn't huge, but she's about 50lbs and a lot of other hotels have a max of 25-30lbs. Dog racists if you ask me! There isn't any grass near the hotel that we could find (within 5 blocks at least) so if your dog needs grass to go, I would look elsewhere. Parking was a bitch. The parking garage isn't connected to the hotel, so you're stuck lugging your suitcases, purse, dog etc. down the busy sidewalks of Chicago. It's only half a block away but when you have a ton of crap, it seems like miles. The room was nice and CLEAN. And it was really quiet the whole time we were there. My only complaint about the room itself was the fact our thermostat was broken and we were freezing the whole night. It was stuck in the ""on"" position at 67 degrees, there was no way to turn off the fan or anything. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave quite easily from this location, and the Sears tower is close by.";4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The decor in the lobby is funky/retro/neat but the rooms were tiny!. There was barely any space to pass between the dresser and the bed. Also the bathroom doors weren't real doors, they were more like shutters.

Yes, the rooms tend to be small - but it's an historic building in downtown Chicago, and that's to be expected! From what I've experienced staying in other hotels in that area the Allegro's rooms are a fine size, and much nicer than most as far as decor and amenities. On our last visit (a weekend trip) we were offered a last-minute upgrade and got a huge 2-room suite for a fantastic price. We loved it, jacuzzi tub and all. Also, they've updated the wallpaper, furniture, and bedding since our last stay -- gorgeous. Staff were nice and helpful as always, the evening wine/cheese party was a plus, and the location is perfect for a weekend touring around downtown. Probably the only complaint I might have is that noise can be a problem - we could hear the person in the room behind ours when he talked on the phone. Of course, that might have just been because he was shouting... Oh - last but not least, they have FABULOUS swag bags for the kids.

If you join the Kimpton InTouch membership club (free), you get free wifi connectivity in your room as well as Raid the Minibar privileges, which allow you to get up to 2 items, for a total of $10, from the minibar for free. The hotel has a lot of great lounge areas, and the 312 restaurant is good as well (separate review for that).  They did a fantastic job with the cocktail hour and reception, and everything else was great.

The lobby is fantastic, especially the hidden sitting room behind the fireplace wall.  I enjoy the Kimpton's hour long wine reception btw 5 and 6.  A perfect starter before heading out into the city for dinner.  They also have a Wii in the lobby which is a great distraction for the younger travelers.  There is both a restaurant and bar in the building as well. The elevator situation is less than ideal - long waits and overcrowded.  I suppose this is to be expected in any tall building - What can you do?  Location in the Loop is nice, and located not too far from access to the El and the subway. My husband gets the government rate - so if you book early enough, can't complain for $158 a night.  It was also an anniversay trip, so the hotel sent a bottle of champagne up to our room free of charge. The only negative at this point - I made a local call from the hotel room - and got charged $1.50.  Not the end of the world, but since when are there charges for local calls??";4;3;3;3;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The price is right, and the staff are actually pretty helpful.  We had a tub that wouldn't drain and by the time we got back from breakfast it was fixed.  Not bad. The TV is the sadly the same 2001 fakey flat screen Toshiba that I have at home -- and it had a bad hissing problem until I figured out the volume settings were all wonky.  But still, not bad.  The wifi was working and the Chivas in the wet bar was only 5 bucks so I was happy. Then came Monday morning.  9 am.  It sounded like a guy was having a wrestling match with his vacuum cleaner outside our door.  Tried as a might to sleep through it, I just couldn't.  The guy was yelling, banging around, vacuuming up a storm, seemingly in the same square foot of carpet right next to our door for at least a half hour.  And right as I'd given up all hope of not having to get out of bed and calling someone -- he moved on.  Not the way you'd want to be woken up after a long night. But aside from that incident and the small nit-picky things, it was a good place to stay.  It was too bad we weren't around for the free wine services -- that seemed like a nice bonus.  I can't say anything about the restaurant or the bar that are next door, they looked a bit over-priced and well, not the kind of places I'd go to.  But those places probably have their own yelp pages.";3;4;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

We had our ups and downs, but when we finally parted and settled our bill, I couldn't have asked for a better time together. Here are the straight up facts - wedding related, and not. 1. The wedding coordinator, Kerry, despite her insane schedule, got back to me in a reasonable amount of time.  While sometimes I wanted answers ASAP, I had to remember not everyone checks their work email at 6pm Sunday night. Kerry was extremely patient with my now husband and I while we flipped flopped between action stations and a plated meal until the last possible minute.  She understood our situation of planning from out of state and only being able to meet in person a couple times before the big day.  And throughout the process, Kerry was nice, yet didn't give us any B.S. 2. Free Wine Hour. 3. Food = awesome.  Fully surpassed everyone's thoughts on what wedding food usually tastes like.  People are still talking about the mashed potato bar, beef wellington puffs (appetizers), and the pasta bar. 4. Rooms. During my 4 night stay, I was in a spacious suite, but even guests and parents who stayed in regular rooms never complained about the size.  Everything was comfy, clean, and well decorated. Not to mention the location of the hotel was perfect for out of town guests to see Millennium Park, Daley Plaza, ""Marshall Fields"", State Street, etc. 5. Decor.  I heart the decor.  It made for awesome wedding photos! 6. Free Wine. 7. Room Block.  Due to the tanking economy, the Allegro kept dropping their rates.  We had to renegotiate our block rate a couple times, but in the end, everything worked out okay. 8. Free Wine.  Did I say that yet?  Because every guest staying at the hotel thoroughly enjoyed it.

The sucky part of the hotel is the actual room (I've stayed here a number of times, it's consistent).  Old A/C wall units will dry you out to a crisp, and a 1 degree change on the thermostat equates to a 10 degree swing.  The bathroom is uncomfortably small, even for a boutique hotel.  It's small, even if you were in Europe at a boutique hotel.  Lilliputian.  The basin is a joke, but at least the shower is made for adult-sized people.  Carpet is old, walls are thin.  Beds are decent though, and if you're an In-Touch member you do get $10 mini bar credit.

883;8/7/2010;7pS3qyZelxsOwQPqqxAnsw;aKN3Fq2uaRJTwZRPlI5GcQ;"Why is it that hotels feel they can impress you with a monster lobby and then cram you into a tiny room? I don't know about you, but that just don't seem to add up. In fact, the Allegro doesn't just have one lobby - it has two. You walk in on the ground floor, with a very impressive staircase leading upwards to, wait for it, the real lobby! It's an elegant, gorgeous and spacious room that's well-decorated and filled with people. It actually took me a moment to find the check-in desk, as it was tucked away in the corner of the room. ...or maybe I just got distracted by the free wine bar. As I would later learn, there is a complimentary wine tasting everyday which includes red, white and house sangria. Oh baby. I checked into the hotel, was given my room key, headed upstairs and found - a tiny room. A bed, a TV tucked in the corner and just enough room for a desk and a night table.  When the bathroom doors open, they almost touch the opposite wall. Everything felt cramped in the worst way possible. The room was also decorated with this 1970's wallpaper of a white background with brown circles and squares. I looked at it for a few minutes and actually felt reality start to slip away from me as I slowly began to loose my mind. Thanks Hotel Allegro for that experience. Plus, they had this funky rounded sink that splashed water on me every time I turned it on! Every time! Gah! There was free Internet, which was nice, but you had to first sign up for a really annoying honored guest program to get it. Somehow, I felt less than honored if I had to jump through hoops to get Internet - but that's just me. So, for the splendor and free wine of downstairs, I'm giving a 5, but for the room, I'm giving a 2 - and rounding down to about a 3. And that's what I have to say about that.";3;2;1;2;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The complimentary wine happy hour in the early evening was perfect. We took a few glasses up to our room after checking in with no problems and were pleasantly surprised with the hip decor of the rooms. The bed looked super cozy and proved later to be just that. The room and bathroom were a little on the smallish side but normal for Chicago standards. The concierge later recommended a great pizzeria for dinner and printed out a map for us to give the cab driver. He also suggested a few tourist things for us to do and reserved tickets for us on the Architectural Boat Tour. Very helpful!

This hotel has more of a modern twist to it than, say, the Drake or the Palomar House. The lobby and the suites are decked out in geometric and Art Deco patterns -- some pretty wacky and colorful, but tasteful at the same time. The room was smaller than average and lacked a decent view, but it did have a very nice flat screen TV and French doors leading to the bathroom. The booklets on the desk would have been helpful to me had I been a tourist. We had complimentary drinks in the lobby before dinner, along with some delicious little hors d'oeuvres. The banquet room is a little more old-world looking than the rest of the hotel. All the food was pretty delicious, from the Caesar salad to the chicken to the chocolate cake and coffee. The round tables for eight were nice and roomy. Sometimes I feel squished in and crowded at banquet tables, but not here. After dinner, we had some more drinks at Encore, the hotel bar. The round bar in the middle is nicely designed, and the cocktails are prepared with care rather than quickly thrown together. Bottom line, if you love Art Deco and want to stay somewhere close to the theater district in the city, this may be a good option. But with more classic hotels in the area offering similar prices and more of an old-Chicago atmosphere, I'd rather stay at one of those.";4;2;2;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

We checked out a number of historic hotels downtown and left each one feeling pretty ""meh."" We saw blah ballrooms, met with indifferent hotel event coordinators, and we were starting to think we wouldn't find the spot we were looking for, until we saw the Allegro. The ballroom is gorgeous and was perfect for our 150-person wedding. It's modern, but with many historic touches, and we loved the urban feel of having the L go by the ballroom windows during the evening reception (but you absolutely couldn't hear the train). And we got so many compliments from our guests on the food. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator, and yet every part of our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to the amazing Allegro staff. From the doormen to the bellhops to the desk staff, I have never met a friendlier and more helpful group of hotel employees.  The catering/event staff in particular made the entire experience painless. My feelings were reaffirmed when my husband and I came back to the Allegro to reshoot our wedding photos recently. Shortly after our wedding, we found out our photographer had lost our wedding photos (wedding tip: when researching photographers, ask them how and when they back up their photos).  We decided to throw on the ol' tux and white dress and take some new photos with a new photographer, and when I contacted catering managers Kerry and Alyssa they couldn't have been more sympathetic or helpful. When we came by to retake the photos they surprised us with the hospitality suite for the afternoon (easily one of the coolest hotel rooms in the city) and a bottle of bubbly. We got some great photos in the suite, lobby and ballroom. Kerry and Alyssa really helped make an unfortunate situation fun and memorable -- four whole months after our event.   The Allegro is a fun, stylish hotel all on its own, but the staff is what makes it a particularly special place for an event.";5;4;3;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

I ordered room service for breakfast and that was probably a mistake.  The coffee was terrible, tasted pretty water down so I didn't finish it.  It was also pretty spendy but room service usually is.  Don't order fruit yogurt, they take plain yogurt and add strawberry jam to it - or at least that's what it looked like.";3;2;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the ""Crimson Cooler"" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil.  It's my perfect drink.  The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying.

One of the best accommodations about this hotel was the complimentary breakfast--it is one of a kind. It is not the typical doughnuts and coffee table. It is a little bar area that a woman controls.

The more times I stayed here, the more I enjoyed it.  First off, I have always found the service to be great.  I feel welcomed when I check in, and feel like they appriciated my stay when I check out.  That is big... hotels are a service industry and many lose sight of that!  Overall, I would say the service here is top notch (and I have stayed at many of the more pricey places in the area too). The rooms could be hit or miss... but are always clean and everything is working order.  The closets can be small or not there, so when checking in be sure to make sure you get a room with a decent closet if you are staying a few days!  I have had tiny rooms, regular rooms and suites.  The suites are very large BTW. Here are the downsides or things to watch for (and again, I am giving it 4 stars so you could see it does not matter too much): No coffee makers in the room... I have coffee 24/7 so that is a bit of a challenge.  There is a Dunkin Donuts next door though, no biggie. The elevators could be SLOW during peak times.  If you need a speedy exit, choose a low floor or something close to the stairs. If you like it uber quiet, be sure to ask for something away from the trains. Upsides: Aveda bath soaps.  Sure it is a small thing, but they are nice products and not cheap. iHome alarm clocks (I forget if all rooms have them or just the suites).  Charge your iPod and wake up to your music.  Good stuff! Nice TV's.  I never turn mine on, but if you are a TV nut they are good. Eco-Friendly:  I'm not a tree hugger... but if you are the non-leg-shaving type you might admire their efforts! Free wine hour/happy hour:  Usually have some good apps and wine plus some seasonal drinks (spiked hot toddy the last time) Helpful staff:  Always a plus!

Encore Liquid Lounge was a perfect spot for us to unwind that first night, as well as a good starting point every night thereafter. This is a renovated hotel, so you need to come with proper expectations. You can tell this is a very old building, with rooms that are very small compared to newer hotels. But that's the way it was back then and I've experienced the same in similar hotels in other cities. Given all that, they've done an excellent job on the renovation. The rooms are clean and up-to-date. The bathrooms are beautiful. The lobby is done really well and makes a great place for the nightly wine-hour. The standout for us was the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was incredibly considerate and polite. We always ask everyone besides the concierge on what to do and where to go. Julio gave us great recommendations and presented genuine thoughtfulness. Definitely seek this gentleman out. We would and have recommended this hotel to others with proper expectations in mind. For the price, this is a great value. *I've seen other reviews with complaints about the thin walls and noisy hallways. Luckily for us, we didn't experience any of that.

First the location is great.  2 blocks from the Blue Line metro stop which runs straight for the airport.  It's close to Millenium Park where I'm going jogging in the morning, and close to the offices of the businesses I'm visiting. The hotel has been recently remodeled and upgraded.  The lobby is plush and comfy; the $109 room I got from http://Kayak.com was clean, modern, although not super big. Surprisingly this was the 2nd least expensive option available.  The cheapest option had abysmal Yelp reviews, everything else for $30 or $40 more didn't have stellar reviews either.  Allegro is a good middle of the road choice for the casual business traveler. What I also liked, and which prompted me to give the 5-start rating, is that they didn't nickle and dime me for things that should be a commodity.  I can't stand it when hotels charge me $10+ for 24 hours of wireless access.  The Allegro has free wireless if you sign up for their (free) customer loyalty program.  That's a fair trade.  Same with things like toothbrushes.  I'm always annoyed when I stay at a $150+ a night place and they charge me $5 for toothpaste.  That's just ridiculous.  The Allegro actually has a list posted in the bathroom of the toiletry items that are free (all the most common ones are) and the ones they charge for like nail clippers.  And the fee is moderate too. Tumbs up also for the fluffy duvets and super comfortable bed. It seems run by conscious people that care about the customer experience.  Recommended.";5;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Valet's good too - there was this guy Chuck at the valet when I stayed here a few months ago and he was just the nicest guy. Haven't seen him the last 2 times I stayed here though. Also ordered room service for breakfast once and it was great. Like others have mentioned, the rooms (and sinks and closets) are definitely smaller, but in my opinion they're enough for 2. I've stayed here with my partner for over a week before and we had everything we needed (although a microwave would have been nice). It just sort of feels like living in New York, you have to be neat and make sure every space is being used. I've also stayed at the King suite before - nice separate living room space, but you can only sleep 1 comfortably on the sofa bed. My friends opted to lay the pillows on the floor and slept on the floor instead. I get the feeling that the hotel doesn't have all its processes down yet. Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up. An unfortunate incident likely resulting from being in an older building, but somehow I still like this hotel a whole lot and keep going back. I now request for quiet rooms in my Kimpton profile, and it seems to have helped in my most recent stay.";4;1;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The website for this hotel was so gorgeous that my friends came expecting to be awed...instead what I got was probably the worst room in the entire hotel. It was the size of my college dorm room, the bathroom can be more or less described as an 'efficiency' and my view (way up high on the 10th floor)...brace yourself...was of a parking lot across the street. What made it worse was that it was 2 steps from the elevator so all I heard during the night were the dings of people going up and down. Which brings me up to my next point...I had 2 friends over to watch tv for a few hours before going out and management called my room 4 times to complain about the 'noise level'.  At one point they said 'we are going to have to ask you to leave if this keeps up' ...not a great thing to say to a guest? especially when that guest has to listen to the elevator all night. In summary, this hotel should not be considered a 4 star. I've stayed at holiday inns that were much more quiet, considerate and BIGGER. Maybe they just like to yank my chain because I bought it off of priceline but at this price point, I would've been better off putting up an extra 50 to be pampered, not insulted.";1;1;0;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

No worries; I got off on Cumberland and took the streets into downtown.  We pulled up to the Hotel at 7:38PM.  Yeah - I know right?  The doorman and bell person were ON POINT.  We simply hopped out, opened the trucks hatch, they took my last name and our bags, gave us 2 tickets; one for the valet and one to pick up out luggage upon check in.   Nice! We walked 7 seconds to the show next door with NO worries. Upon arriving back at the hotel to check in; we were given double bed rooms on a high floor as requested; small rooms but hell it was efficient.  We ordered room service, laughed loudly with no repercussions from the neighbors or the front desk, and when we went out dancing it didn't take forever for them to bring the wheels around. We all had a great time and would return.";4;0;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

After checking in and seeing the lobby I was a bit disappointed by the room.  The decor was nice, but the room was quite small and unfortunately the view, even from the 18th floor, was an eyesore.  But I've come to learn that's pretty much par for the course in Chicago.  Otherwise, the snack bar offered some healthy, organic treats and the toiletries weren't tested on animals which is important to me. The gym is impressive for a hotel and I was able to get a decent workout.  I didn't eat in the attached restaurants in part because the breakfast was outrageously expensive.  A coupon for dinner is provided for the attached restaurant, but I didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  The menu looked decent. I would stay here again and recommend it for sure.  I found a great deal on http://hotels.com, it's in a great location near an L stop and the shopping district on State Street, and I looked forward to coming back to Allegro after work each day.  The only qualm I have is the surcharge to use the internet.  In this day in age, most travelers bring their laptops everywhere they go and it's a common courtesy for any hotel to provide free internet access.";4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Like a few other people who booked there, I was expecting a room that was smaller, I guess I'm used to many historic type hotels rooms in NYC which have basically enough room for the bed and a little walking space, nice molding on the walls but not a whole lot of space to walk lol.  I had a premier king room which basically was a king room with a little more space, well, I had plenty of space.  Nice amenities (Aveda), housekeeping is fantastic as they cleaned my room somehow when I wasn't there.  I was impressed because I was in and out throughout my 3 day stay and never saw them in my room.  I was also impressed by the fact that I looked down onto the L tracks but never heard the train.  Maybe I was too immersed in my work but it definately wasn't like some street noise I've encountered at many other hotels.  Room service, the person answering the phone was very thorough and the food was fast, hot and correct.  The hotel is very conveniently located so that if you want to see/go anywhere in the loop you can really walk.  If you need to hop on the L, its centrally located to Wells and the Lake st stops.   Points to help out When you first walk in, there is a flight of stairs which you have to go up to get to the main lobby Definately join InTouch before you check in Use the hotels services ie concierge, fitness room";4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

I have stayed at the Allegro once before, well over a year ago and prior to the massive renovation. The good: - The location is touristy, but convenient. The El is very close by, as are multiple bars and restaurants. - The renovation is definitely a huge improvement. The palette is pleasing and the rooms are much more restful. - The beds are comfortable, as expected at a Kimpton hotel. The bad: - Leave your toiletries at home, because there is absolutely no space to place them in the bathroom. Literally...zero. - The closets are extremely bizarre. They removed the main rack to hang your clothing and replaced it with two face-out racks...you can't see your clothes all at once, as you are forced to stack them on top of each other. Also, you'll find tacky apparel the hotel is trying to get you to purchase, taking up the majority of hangers. - The doormen (with the exception of one, Fidel) are surly and I found this quite annoying. I was told which cab to get into, as though I'd never hailed a cab before (I am from NYC). While approaching the hotel on several occasions, the doormen would yell at me what door to use (there are three, all of which work...) yet not once did they bother to open it for me. Where is the service? - While check-in was pleasant, the woman who checked me out was both rude and abrupt. Not only was I not asked how my stay was, but I was hastily shoved a receipt (no envelope, no review of charges) and shoved aside for another guest who was checking in...at noon. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and normally have the Kimpton group on the very top of my hotel list.

These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a ""love kit"", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz.

Room size for several rooms is EXTREMELY small.  I think they tried to do what they could with what they had.  It is, after all, a vintage 1926 building.  I was extremely disappointed with the room size, and, at first, put off by the decor.  My eyes eventually settled and adjusted though.  Also, it seems to make sense with the boutique theme of the hotel. On the positive, the service was good but uneven at times.  ""Superbad"" at the counter was wonderful and even showed my friend and I a bigger room because we had asked to see one.  Other front desk folks were average to below average for a four star place.  I never used the concierge.  The doormen were friendly and helpful.  Location is good.  Readily accessible to the Washington/Wells station on the ""L"".  Also several bus lines run nearby.  You are literally next door to Chicago City Hall and in the same building as the Cadillac Theatre and a few minutes walk from the iconic Chicago Theatre and the Oriental Theatre.  You're about a 10-15 minute walk from the Willis Tower and about two blocks south of the Chicago River.   The free wine is a great amenity nightly, and they bring some nice appetizers over from the 312 Chicago...a restaurant that is co-located in the building.  The food was good (had room service breakfast) and the amenities were enjoyable.   Beds were nice and comfy.  Showers good and powerful.  The housekeeping crew was tremendously nice and helpful.  The place is brand new and clean having just been renovated last year. Negatives?  The wireless internet was a continuous problem.  Two days, it worked fabulously, and two days it just plain was un-usably slow.  I had to go down to the lobby.  The maintenance crew barged in on me after two quick knocks one day.  I get why they did it, but I still don't get the decor for sure.  It's such a mismash of things.  My bathroom in my room was very small.  The sink was very odd, too.  It tended to allow water to swash out everywhere. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill hotel experience, go to the Holiday Inn.  This is a boutique hotel, and it will not appeal to everyone.  I appreciate what Kimpton is trying to do with this property.  It's definitely a different experience than I've ever had at another hotel.   I might take another shot at the Allegro with another room someday.  Fun and disappointment mixed together for an average stay.";3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The reason I say this is because the rooms are really way to small - at least the Cozy rooms were. The room itself was also slightly old. You can tell from the walls and doors even though the decor in the rooms was modern. The bathroom was also way too small. There really was no space to move at all and this was the same with the spacing between the desk and the bed. It was very difficult to even slide the desk chair out. Another thing that bothered me during the stay was the fact the walls are paper thin. The room next to mine was definitely throwing a party and unfortunately, I could hear the television and the screaming pretty clearly. While the rooms themselves were cramped and older, the overall hotel decor was magnificent. The lobby was beautiful along with the second floor of the hotel - it'd be a great place to throw a party or event. I just wished that the spaciousness of the public areas applied to the guest rooms. The hotel service was pretty good though. I ordered late night room service and even though the kitchen messed up the order, they immediately sent up a different late night entree (on the house) and said that I can order whatever I like for breakfast the next day free of charge. My boyfriend and I definitely took advantage of that one and W Hotel did not say a word about it. Internet was also complimentary during our stay so that was definitely a plus. On another positive note, the location of the hotel couldn't be better so it was definitely very convenient to get around.";3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Bill was more than obliged to get accommodate my request. However, when I got into my room, the view was only a building. Ironically, a few minutes later, Bill called and wanted to make sure if the view was to my liking. While the room was very spacious and in the corner of the hotel, I admitted to him that the view was not to my taste. Bill then decided to call me back in a few minutes so he could look over the hotel layout in order to find me the perfect room. A few minutes later, he called back and presented me with a room that could be a hit/ miss. Not only did he come up personally to show me the room, but he also brought up the new keys and offered to carry my bags. This by far is the best ""above and beyond"" experience I have ever encountered. Major props to Bill! 2. Concierge was awesome! Eden was very sincere and helpful when it came to planning my brunch/ sightseeing. She also gave me her business card and hand wrote her name on the card so I could give to the hostess at the cafe, in order to be 1st on the list. Concierge connections such as that definitely brings value to rate! Thank you, Eden! 3. Stephen Bee (manager on duty), thank you!

Whenever."" motto.  They don't stand by it.   Anyway, besides that, my stay was nothing special.  Yeah the room's nice but gosh every time you flush the toilet you feel like you're flushing an airplane toilet; talk about high pressure.  Then you wonder if the rooms around you can hear you and you feel bad at the same time if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, which brings me back to the service.  They're so lazy they don't want to bother having plumbers on staff to fix a clogged toilet so they equip each room with the highest pressure toilet they can find.  Genius.";2;4;2;2;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

My room was tiny, even by Chicago standards, the bathroom so cramped and crowded that my makeup fell into the toilet.  The bed had a glowing light underneath that I couldn't figure out how to turn off.  I had to sleep with the light on. The water got turned off one day into the trip.  Hotel staff offered me a Fuji water to compensate for the fact that my co-worker and I could not flush our toilet, brush our teeth, or take a shower.  Gee, thanks. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm to find the water still turned off.  Front desk arranged for a transfer to W Lakeshore but was not courteous at all.  The woman I spoke to refused to let me speak to her manager.  We moved to another hotel and I complained to Starwood corporate.  The hotel compensated me some points, but the whole experience was way horrendous.";1;4;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Some tables on the other side of the room never got food, even though my cousin laid out very specific floor plans as to how many of each type of entree each table received. That's just atrocioius, who ever heard of a big fancy hotel not feeding all of its wedding guests? There are two bars, set up in tremendously inconvenient corners of the ball room, so that in order to grab a jack and coke, you had to squeeze yourself between a few tables and knock into about 15 people on your way. The wedding was a Greek wedding, so the reception followed in kind, with a lot of Greek dancing. One of these dances involves the relatives of the bride and groom throwing money at the new couple. Hotel staff was all too quick to sweep up this money on the floor and pocketed quite a bit of it (according to my cousin, anyway).

The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant.

Anyways, we navigated out way (with our suitcases) through a maze of couches and cosmo-sippers to the ""corner desk"" and finally made it to our room. I guess I'm just an old fart, but I thought it was a little too trendy. Like, why do I need lights eminating from under the bed? And why do I need inspirational phrases on the pillows & walls? Just give me a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. Bathroom was TINY, and the toilet was wedged between the sink and the wall with very little room to sit comfortably while you do your business.

The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to ""wicked"". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the ""hubub"" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back.

It was tucked away in the corner of the bathroom and there was literally only 2 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall. So bizarre, considering that the room itself had this big open welcome area that was directly adjacent to the bathroom. Other than those relatively minor complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much.

A good thing to note is that this location isn't particularly close to anything besides the Willis Tower and Millennium Park, meaning if you're in town and want to go out at night, the W Hotel - Lakeshore is a lot closer to a livelier nightlife.

I went with a bit of trepidation, given that I am not a particular fan of the W on Lex in NYC. A major discount on the regular rate was the motivation to give it a try. When you walk in the front door, you could swear you are walking into a mini versus of the NYC Lex W with Whiskey Blue on the left and a popular after hours lounge the right. However, after spending a few more minutes soaking in the atmosphere you'll notice the vaulted ceiling, tile, and marble accents that give it a warmer, more dignified feel. The elevators will almost knock you over with their 3-d holographic-like walls. Expecting the usual W-esque room, we were amazed to find out they upgraded us to a large junior suite. It looked like the head designer from Pottery Barn just redid the place. Very impressive. What was not impressive is that they want $15 to connect to the net for the day (and no Boingo), though the lobby wireless was free. The staff was especially pleasant. Though it was -30 windchill, the door man stood outside for almost 15 minutes trying to find us a cab. He then convinced the Acura driver to drive us to Midway for no charge. They have a joint promotion with Acura to drive you anywhere within 5 miles for free to show off their cars. We wish we knew this earlier. The only problem is the location if you are going for a weekend. It is only one block from the Quincy L stop, which is nice if you are coming from Midway. But you have to transfer (or jaunt up to Clark and Lake) if you plan to use the trains for anywhere else. It is not a bad walk to State Street to Marshall Fields (ugh....""Macys""....) but a bear to get up to Mag Mile if it is zero like it was the weekend we went. Cabs are the order of the day, but not easy to find in the financial district on the weekend. Very few decent restaurants in the area.

The purple lights and throbbing techno music don't do a whole lot for me, so I'm thankful that they're restricted to the first floor and the elevators. The room my partner and I stayed in was small but adequately furnished with sleek, modern furniture in neutral colors. There was a king sized bed, desk, chair, a few cabinets, and plenty of conveniently placed outlets for cellphone chargers, laptops, etc. Because we were placed in a corner room, the placement of our television was a bit awkward (it's my understanding that most of the rooms have the television positioned on a wall facing the bed, but our bed faced an exterior wall with windows and the television was mounted off to the side -- had we actually been using the television, this might have posed an issue.) The bathroom was adequately stocked with plush towels and Bliss brand toiletries. My only complaint is that the sink was borderline miniature. It seemed like no matter how careful I was when I brushed my teeth or washed my hands, I always ended up having to grab a hand towel and mop some water up off the floor. The hotel is located near stops for both the red and blue L lines, which was perfect for my partner and I. We utilized the L in favor of cabs throughout our stay and were able to get to the majority of our destinations via the red line (which conveniently runs all night.) The staff was friendly and efficient, willing to offer directions and dining recommendations. I used the ""Whatever/Whenever"" service once to request foam pillows instead of down (allergies!) and considering that I called well after midnight, they arrived promptly. My one real complaint (aside from the tiny bathroom sink) is that the in-room wireless is not complimentary. There is complimentary wireless in the lobby area, but the club decor/music in the lobby doesn't exactly facilitate a good working environment. So, if you need to keep up on your work e-mail and are without a smart phone, you'll likely have to shell out for in-room wireless.";3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

The rooms had a very modern appeal and the towels were very lush.  The square footage was small, but they made good use of their space to seem bigger. Quick room service.  Love the apples and little nooks in the lobby.  Two bars, one in the lobby and a larger one with a street entrance.

The front desk is in an odd location - it requires directions to find.  The decor in the hotel is modern. I checked in around midnight and had booked a room that was supposed to a ""Wonderful Room"" with 253 sq ft.  Instead, they sent me to a room about half that size.  The bathroom was so small that there was no room for the waste basket - which they positioned practically  in front of the toilet.  The vanity was so small that there was definitely no place to put the regular toiletries people bring when they travel.  I assume they think you will be running these back and forth between your luggage and the bathroom. The person checking me in informed me that this was a newly renovated room and it did smell that way.  However, they missed small details such as the air conditioner against the wall was not caulked and the old wall was showing behind it. When I called to let them know I was not satisfied with this accommodation, they offered to upgrade me for another $70/night.  Eventually, I went down to the front desk and the next person on duty was excellent.  He was anxious to make things right and immediately moved me to another room that was twice the size - probably the room I reserved at 253 sq ft. (no additional charge) The lounge was nice.  The service was good and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The security personnel were also nice as were the people at the bell desk. The exercise room was reasonable (called the Sweat Room) - but the thermostat was set too high and it was pretty warm in there.  I guess that's why they call it the sweat room:-)   There was a relatively small collection of equipment but it was in good condition and well maintained.

You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling.

The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects.

Light projections, art, velvet furniture, black lobby. 2 door guys, 1 concierge, 2 desk people, 1 very tall blonde and removed store clerk. Some very cute, kitschy and extremely specific items in the hotel shoppe. The hotel's restaurants and bars swing right off the lobby behind tall black walls. Initial impression was grande. The stay. The stay was super plush with a cushy king, proper amount of pillows for 2 plus a nice body pillow xtra. Toiletries included Bliss travel pack (found at Sephora for $25 a pop). Very nice. CS/Modern Luxury and Wired magazine in the room, nice details. Overall, the stay was comfy and friendly. We stayed in the Fabulous room. Service. Service was ok. It didn't seem to be very coordinated. I was supposed to have champagne and strawberries delivered for my birthday morning. Didn't happen and we got tired of waiting. They tried to reschedule for the evening and that really wasn't as seamless as you'd think, either. The first night of our stay, we requested extra hangers. We had to ask repeatedly and then we finally got them. Like a DOZEN of them, on our last day. Thanks. The Whiskey Blue was a nice hangout and you can't really beat the location as far as being able to walk to many of the touristy attractions and CTA. The hotel did seem to be a magnet for underage teens which was kind of odd to me. For some reason, I don't really notice teens in VA unless it's in Tysons Corner, where they persist in droves.

There is no pool.  OK, small oversight.  As I got settled in, I ordered room service for myself and their child. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I asked for a chicken sandwich (seriously, this was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was $14) and a peanut butter sandwich for the little guy. I specified 3 times to not put jelly on this sandwich.   I also ordered a glass of milk and a diet pepsi. The bill total was $44.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  I know that hotels way overcharge for room service but you can get some decent food...this was crap.  The sandwich was way over seasoned and mushy and the fries were stuck together and, again, way over seasoned.  The peanut butter sandwich came WITH JELLY on hard bread.  It did not get eaten.

When I asked where they were planning on staying, they replied 'Red Roof Inn'. Noooooooo! I quickly called Blu Aqua Hotel and booked a 2-night stay (my treat!) for them. Blu Aqua was awesome! They first looked to see if there were any specials they had for seniors. They didn't at the time, so they offered a breakfast and balcony room package deal. Blu Aqua upgraded my parents room to a corner room (much bigger) with wrap around balcony. They had beautiful chocolates waiting in their room (a birthday and anniversary gift from hotel). They also allowed my parents a super late check out. While in Chicago, my Dad got his wallet snatched (not anywhere near the hotel). The Concierge totally helped Dad cancel his cards by looking online for phone numbers, etc. This would have taken a huge amount of time (and a lot of stress) for my non-tech savvy parents to do this on their own. I totally appreciate how Blu Aqu took care of my parents (especially after the wallet snatching - and helped make such an enjoyable trip). My parents are older (Mom - 72, Dad - 81).

The beds are ridiculously comfortable, the shower is GIANT (some rooms have up-to-your-neck deep soaking tubs), the public spaces are inviting and comfortable. But, as an event planner, when I'm paying this much money for a room/event space, I expect some pretty high end functioning. We had several mix ups with our staff rooms and guest rooms (the hotel checking people out too soon or cancelling reservations even when we specifically stated the reservation needed to be changed, not cancelled), the shower handle in my bath broke, as did the knob that gave functionality to the handheld shower head. A member shut her glass shower door only to have it shatter (thankfully it's covered by a film that held the glass in place). And the room had a ridiculous espresso machine that didn't work properly. As far as the event space...again, aethetitically, it's great but it's not set up well for functionality. Screens are too small in meeting rooms, sound system is not created to work on an individual room basis so stand speakers that blocked the screen views were set up, and the registration area is a bar that has little functionality for the needs of registering several hundred people. As a plus, the service staff were extremely friendly and on top of things as soon as they needed to be done...which was a big plus, but not quite enough to make up for the other elements. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks before I get back there next year for our 2013 conference.";3;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

The shower has a rain fall shower head and also a wand that sprays water which after using once, I couldn't figure out how to turn on again. There's a huge bathtub to relax in. Cool little corner toilet which you can close off. And all this is WHITE WHITE WHITE - in other words.. CLEAN! Heater kept us warm. Large flat screen TV if that's important to ya. Free Wi-Fi. Free coffee/tea station in the room. Ipod/radio deck. Wine glasses, mugs, cups, AND to-go cups. bottle opener with a cork screw attached to it. Mini-bar/fridge. What else? 1 robe (why one?), ironing board, laptop sized safe.. plenty of conveniently placed plugs/outlets to charge phones and cameras. Literally like a block or so away from beautiful Millennium park. Few blocks from the trains. There's a CVS next door. Fillini downstairs is beautiful. We had two free drinks voucher so stopped by and had fancy cocktails before heading out. There are two floors dedicated to a pool area, game room (which consists of a pool table and cards table), a community room with a fireplace, food area with microwaves, gym with brand new equipment (lots of it!), basketball court, sauna & steam room, outdoor garden and running track. What doesn't this hotel have, right? If we weren't limited on time, I would've liked to actually use all the amenities. Best of all... they allow check out time as late as 6pm!! (depends on availability)... 6pm! That's practically a whole 'nother day/night. We didn't have to rush out of the hotel early with no where to go and luggages in tow.

After upgrading to a King room with a view, which they also informed us that they couldn't do this for free because we booked through Priceline, we tried getting settled in.  If you didn't catch that, they saved the worst rooms in the hotel for the Priceline guests.  They penalized us for booking through a 3rd party. Be warned, the pictures posted online for this hotel show some very nice rooms.  Those were not the rooms we saw.  The hotel is so dated, it's like going back in time.  My wife described the bed linnens as scratchy.  If there was one word to accurately described this hotel it is DATED.

The room was comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet.  We faced the river and the Metra station - I thought it would be loud, but it wasn't at all. The views are the real winner here.  It was a picture each time you looked out the window. The pool was big and my kids made sure we stopped there daily. The restaurant had a great menu with some excellent french fries!  We enjoyed the lunch/dinner menus.  We had breakfast there a couple of times. The buffet was ok - but I preferred to order off the menu. The pancakes were great! I'm a big fan of the hotel bar. It was a little pricey - but worth the location!!

Not a bad place but the rooms were a little outdated and it was in an isolated area.  Since i'm from Chicago, I navigated the area pretty well but for first timers, it may have been a little challenge.  It's VERY quiet after 8pm over there. Not far from the nightlife on Hubbard Street and decent staff(except for the one guy who gave me the wrong room and had an attitude). I got a $90 room from priceline but i DO NOT recommend paying $230 which is the regular price. There is a nice bar there with a view but we didn't go there. It's a no frills, decent hotel with slow free wi-fi.  It's definitely not high-end.  Also, parking is a cool $35 outdoors FYI.";3;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect!  (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location.  It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views!  The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding.  Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff.  I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them.  Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump.  We asked the concierge.  The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps.  We didn't get to Ace until they had closed.  So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again.  He called the engineer down to meet with us.  The engineer was able to blow up the tire.  The staff were so friendly and so helpful!   My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future!

First of all, the views are of downtown Chicago are breathtaking.  I'm not being biased but I really think the views from the ballroom are the best in the city.  You get views of both branches of the Chicago river. It's beautiful during the day and even more amazing at night.  Our guests complimented us all night long about the view. It's pretty incredible. Next the food is really delicious! We got married on a Friday and had the celebration buffet package.  The package itself is pretty reasonable and the food was delicious. We had Caesar salad, prime rib, chicken, mashed potatoes, fruit, and grilled vegetables. Everything was super delicious. The prime rib and the chicken were juicy and very tasty. The cake, which we got through the package from Alliance bakery was very moist and delicious. We got compliments on the food/cake from our guests as well :D Last but definitely not least, the Event Coordinator, Barbara Martin is just fabulous. She is organized, responds promptly and is very nice to work with.  She was one of the reasons we booked the venue. We knew with Barbara that we would be in good hands. Throughout the planning process we had great communication and she was extremely helpful getting things in order the day of the wedding. The Holiday Inn was recently remodeled with the newly added Wolf Point room. I think the secret is now getting out on how great it is.  The prices are very reasonable for a downtown venue.

Poor room size, furnishings, and amenities. Very poor view (interior 'courtyard' view of pool roof and concrete wall only). The separate main atrium had a very cold appearance and feel, could use color and/or planters in the 10+ levels of visible corridors. Clothes iron leaked water all over my dress shirt in the morning, so I had to reuse a shirt from the previous day, which is important not to do when visiting clients, or even coworkers. The clerk I brought the faulty iron to did not even ask what she could do to make my stay better, let alone apologize for the inconvenience. The front desk staff member who re-validated my parking was rude and confrontational. I waited in line for 5 minutes to re-validate something that was supposed to have been done the night before, and while 2 visitors were awaiting me in my rental car in the parking lot below. She initially said ""no way"" to being able to validate the parking, since I was going to spend that second night with my family nearby, even though 3 members of my party were staying the night at the same Holiday Inn. Finally, when the supervisor was involved, he took care of me right away. Validating a parking ticket should not be brain surgery, but the first clerk and the second ""rude"" one seemed to not understand the system or customer service at all. To add insult to injury, the self-serve breakfast BUFFET was $22, and they had the gall to include a line item for tip in the breakfast bill. I stayed/ate at a Hilton Garden Inn the previous two mornings, and their $11 breakfast buffet was better than this, and neither was much better than the FREE breakfast buffet at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. One last complaint: the business center charges for printing (except for boarding passes). Overall, this was the worst hotel stay that I have had in many years. ""Value"" was definitely missing from this particular hotel, even if my experience might not be representative of the whole chain. My preoccupation with these negative points brings forth a disturbing trend: hotels are keeping room charges at an apparently reasonable rate, but then are gouging guests with expensive parking rates, sky-high breakfast prices, extra-cost printing and sometimes internet service. In the end, it is better to stick with the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express, which include these items as standard.";1;2;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

There is an indoor pool too, which our nephews enjoyed. I walked in there once and it was nice, not overwhelming hot or chlorine smelling as most indoor pools tend to be. Large open lobby great for meeting up and taking wedding photo's. Lobby bar is nice too, which they had later hours. Pizza is good in there as well.

Every time I called they said my name was still on the rooms. I had them change it twice and when my friends got there to check in, my name was STILL on the rooms. I was also told I would get a discounted rate with 2 free breakfasts for EACH room. When my friends checked in, the discounted price was only on one room and it had to changed to all three.  I booked these rooms all together and I had the confirmations stating the prices.  When we tried to get the 2 free breakfasts on Saturday morning they said it was for only one room. I asked to talk to a manager and expressed what I was told over phone and she told me that was not what was said and basically called me a liar. What happened to the customer always being right?  I mean I was trying to scam anyone, just trying to get what I was told I was I supposed to get.  Upon checkout, the front desk person tried to charge me for 4 rooms when I only had 3. I thought we were good once I told him I only had 3. Well when I got home and checked my account, I had 4 charges from the Holiday Inn.

We reserved over the phone because my sister had a block of rooms reserved at a slightly reduced rate for the wedding guests.  I received an email a couple days before, confirming my reservation.  I was in the bridal party, so I was tied up after the ceremony, and left it to my fiancé to check us in.  As we were out taking photos, he called me in a slight panic telling me that the hotel did not have our reservation.  I said they had just sent me an email and to check again. When we arrived back at the hotel, I got in line to see what the issue was and to try to check in.  The woman looked it up again and said she didn't have it.  When I told her about the confirmation email, she said ""We don't do that"" (not true).  She said I would just have to get into my email and get my confirmation number. She then told me that she had a line of people behind me she needed to help, and basically ordered me to leave the front desk area, implying she needed to help her ""real"" customers!! Because of the hotel's crappy internet I could not get online.  My sister, the bride, who had a million other things to worry about, had to track down the hotel wedding planner, who took me into her office to get on my email.  In looking at the reservation, I saw that they had misspelled my last name.  Now, mind you, they had pulled up our reservation block at the desk and were apparently too inept or lazy to glance through the list and find my name- even though it was misspelled, it was only by ONE LETTER!!  There were only about 20 of us in the block, and they didn't even bother to go through the names one at a time to see if I was there. At this point we asked for the manager. We were missing the reception, and were getting pretty upset. He apologized (kind of) and told us he would have a porter bring my fiancé's bags to our room so that we could go and enjoy the reception. Upon returning to our room late that night, we discovered that none of the bags had been brought up as promised!!!  This included valuable items such as a laptop and camera.  We called the front desk and were told that WE would have to come down and get them.   The final straw was that when I had gone down in the morning for brunch (at $20, a total and complete ripoff, but that's where the wedding party was meeting so I had no choice), I asked at the desk if we could have a slightly later checkout time (1:00 instead of noon) because we were still recovering from the night before.  They said sure, no problem, but then at noon ON THE DOT they were banging on our door. I can't even fathom how the service might have been worse.  The only slightly redeeming thing was the wedding planner helping me out- if it hadn't been for her, I don't know how we would have worked anything out.";1;7;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

I'm giving this one a slightly below average rating because on one hand its tucked into a nice spot on a bend of a river so if you just so happen to get a corner suite you can look down the river west and watch the trains go in and out of the Oglivie transportation center, or you could look north as the happy northsiders go about their business.  On the other side it remains a standard issue Holiday Inn.

However, I've had better experiences at other hotels.  Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me.  It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view.  We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel.  They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded.  I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms?  I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view.

I want to expound on this a bit because this awesome breakfast buffet is a good enough reason alone to stay here (but the other amenities are superior, too!).   The $28.00 price tag is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!  Remember, you will likely NOT need another meal that day.   Not only does this buffet have  the traditional fresh omelets and Belgian waffles to order,  but it had TWO different types of smoked salmon (complete with condiments- capers/onions/cream cheese, etc); an array of fresh bagels/breads/muffins, etc; a fresh assortment of fruits, brie and other delicious ($$) cheeses; amazing ""Crab-cakes Benedict""; bacon, sausage (YUM!) and scrambled eggs that were so creamy, it left me wanting to speak with the chef about how he did that en masse!   I'm so impressed with this buffet (can you tell??)!  I have traveled the world and eaten at countless fine restaurants and I would be hard pressed to find a breakfast buffet that compares to this one.  ...perhaps the Auberge St. Antoinne in Quebec, but I digress.   The point is, this hotel (and breakfast buffet) is WORLD CLASS, as is the staff who work there.  Michael Jordan's Bar (in the hotel) has amazing burgers and macaroni & cheese and the hotel itself is something to behold, from the indoor coliseum-like pool area (which you can order drinks to) :) to the Grand Ballroom that houses the largest (12,000 lb) Baccarat crystal chandelier in North America.   All of this equals something to behold in this remarkable hotel.   OH!  And it's entrance opens up onto Michigan Avenue in Chicago...enough said!!

1104;8/23/2012;uYKq0WPnO;bnPpoAsVbULVN8EsUYGGCA;"I recently made the best discovery since Columbus: to stay at a hotel on North (and specifically North) Michigan Ave, you'd have to pay an arm and a leg, or maybe all four of them. If it weren't for consistently stalking internet deals, I'd be staying all the way in the South Side. Here's the thing about my hotel standards: don't care about fanciness, just be clean, roach/rat-free so I don't have nightmares and most of all, proximity. Intercontinental was quite accessible (as in walking distance) to the main attractions in Chicago, was clean and not as fancy as I had imagine it would be. I checked in early since I had an early flight arrival and was told I would be given a call/message when a room is available. Maybe I misinterpreted their implications by giving a call before the 3:00 p.m. usual check-in hour. When the clock hit 3:25, there was still no call but an immediate room when I stormed down there. I was placed in a room in the Main Building, with the whole Historical Building blocking my view of the Chicago River, not that I care too much  about it since I was barely in my room. Turn-off #2: No shower caps or slippers. I've been to cheaper hotels and they would provide them if you ask. Even after calling the front desk, which directed me to some other irrelevant service that made a ""note"", I never got my shower cap. Turn-off #3: Housekeeping. While the ladies do work hard to keep the room nice and tidy, their impatience really annoys me. I would get knocks on my door at 8 a.m. - 9 a.m. every morning, asking if we were ready. No, I am in the middle of my five-hour nap and I'm on vacation, so I will not wake up as if I'm going to work. The fridge was a bit of a problem, seeing I could only fit things up to the size of 2 cans. Only buy small things you know you can fit up to or if you want to do it like I did, place everything on top. Or go all the way down to the 7th floor to grab ice. The ice room is pretty disgusting with the dirty dishes lying around. I've read so many complaints about the paid wi-fi prior to booking, but here's a trick and pay attention carefully: take your laptop, iPad, ipaq by the Starbucks downstairs, connect to the wifi and toy around with it for a few minutes and it will last you throughout the whole night and morning in your room!

I pretty much slept like a (semi-drunk) rock here, I am pleased to report. The room was very small, but fairly nice. I'd agree that it's not a four star hotel - more like 3. I dunno if I'd stay here again, but I don't really have anything bad to say about it. My room was free, however, and I don't think I'd pay more than $200/night for this place, if that. Maybe I'm cheap? It's been a while since I've paid for a hotel room in the US since my bf travels a lot for business...

This hotel is the only one in the city with a street level lobby on Michigan Ave. The service is impeccable, and the facilities are gorgeous. I would give a full five stars, but some of the rooms in the new tower are a bit on the small side. If at all possible, try to stay in the historic tower. OH! and an insider tip! Be sure to ask the concierge about the self guided ipod tour of the property... it's an open secret that you will love to take advantage of. Another tip, if you need to catch a cab to take you south of the river, cross the street before you grab one.

Two strikes and you're down from your four stars to three.  Well, two and-a-half strikes, actually.  I really want to give the Intercontinental 4 stars...but I can't.  Here's why. Strike 1: First night, I return from dinner in the hopes of relaxation and a nice nightcap at ""Eno"" (the hotel's wine/chocolate/cheese spot).  After extensively perusing the insanely awesome wine list and getting my heart set on a particular glass, the girl behind the bar informs me that they'll be closing.  In 10 minutes.  So...""I can buy a bottle to take to my room...but...yeahhhh.""  (Don't want/need a bottle, so no Eno for me.  No.)  Seriously?  You're a hotel bar in downtown Chicago and you're closed by 9:30?  Hrm. Strike 2:  This morning, I wake up in the hopes of hitting the Fitness Center for an early (for me!) morning jog.  Exit elevator on the level labeled FC (fitness center). Woman behind counter:  ""Just looking around?"" Me:  ""Yeah.  I was just gonna get a quick work-out in."" Her:  ""Well, you're aware you have to pay, right?  16 bucks per day, or 20 to cover your usage for your entire stay.  Still want to work out?"" Me (confused, internal dialogue running wild, finally indignant):  ""I guess I'll just wait...?"" What?  I don't get it.  I just don't. Strike 2 and-a-half: I get back from a long day out and I'm seriously crashing from massive amounts of caffeine and all I want is to take my shoes off, and my room key doesn't work.  (Sigh.)  Truck downstairs, wait in line for the one front desk worker to be able to assist me.  Key re-activated, all is well, but still.  It was sort of the straw that broke this reviewer's back.

Um, OK.  Hopefully that was just a NYE thing because it was totally LAME (and I may have snucky some booze in anyway.

As for the good, our room was very nice.  The bed was heavenly and I think I could live in it (I found refuge in those pillows as we painfully watched the Bears blow it.  Awesome we had planned our evening around that).  I also found the room to be really clean (but who really knows these days, especially after watching Dateline when they show those microscopic bugs - ew). Highlights included the bar - great people watching, especially that night because there was a wedding.  Drinks were pricey as expected but the staff was nice.  I did find a SHARD of glass in my martini before I was, oh about to swallow it (wouldn't that have been a Happy New Year?) but the bartender apologetically gave me a new one at no charge.   Shards aside, I had a good experience at the Intercontinental.  It's pretty solid and RIGHT on Michigan across from Nordstrom.  I would recommend that an out-of-towner shacks up here for a visit.";4;6;5;6;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

If you haven't been it's a huge walk in with a curtain you draw. You could probably fit a good 7 people in that shower, which hey, could be fun, but I can't really see the Intercontinental being ""that"" kind of hotel. Anyway, here you are in this second room aka the shower and as you are going about your business you pull the curtain and walk back into the bathroom to find the entire floor soaked. How was this a good idea? First of all it's dangerous. Say you were drinking heavily in the hotel (not that I would know anything about that kind of behavior), but then say you took a shower and walked out to Lake Michigan Avenue on the slick marble floor. That just spells danger to me and a waste of towels since it took all but one of the supplied towels to mop it all up. Other than that, the room was HUGE and the views were great. i stayed in the historic tower and it was nice. Also the beds. WOW. I have trouble sleeping, but man o man, did I ever wake up with the best puffy eyed face and out of control bed head. In my world, that means I actually beat insomnia for one night and won! Other than those things it's just a nice hotel that I think a business traveler would enjoy. They do charge $9.95 a day for Internet which seems lame seeing as how you are already paying over $200 for the room, I mean come on, would it kill ya to comp that, but overall a fine place to rest your head.

1128;1/12/2010;mEGSSPkWctaxwP5KwXtFag;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;"Two words. Historic tower. Yes. If you are going to stay at the Intercontinental- you must stay in the historic tower. The Intercontinental Chicago is really two hotels in one. The historic tower was built in 1929 and was originally the Medinah Athletic Club. The ""north tower"" or main building was actually another hotel that was built in 1961 and was acquired by the Intercontinental and joined together. Thus the style differences between the two towers. While the historic tower costs more, in my opinion, it is worth the money. Look for deals (especially if you are staying over a weekend). My room rate was only $99 a night (had a Groupon for one night and found a deal for the other) This cheap rate got me a standard room in the main tower- but after a little dealing upon check in- I was able to get a corner room in the historic tower for a nominal upgrade fee. My room was lovely. A SE corner room with two windows- one looking over the river and one facing east with views of the lake and Navy Pier. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The staff at this hotel was on their game. Late night room service came within the promised 20 minutes. The valet brought my car around in 5 minutes, turn down service was followed up on, and the doorman was quick to take care of my every need. So why not a perfect score? I think they were a little cheap in some areas and as a frequent traveler, I expect alot. I'd rather pay a little more for the room and not be ""nickel and dimed"" to death throughout my stay. For example- they charged $17.95 a day for wi-fi, there were no high end toiletries in the bathroom, they were missing some expected amenities (complimentary water in bottles, q-tips, shower cap and cotton balls) . Even the business center charged for wi-fi- crazy! And the worst thing? Overnight parking in the hotel cost $53 a night. That's highway robbery and the same price is given for the public as those staying in the hotel. My advice? Drop your bags off with the bellman and then park around the corner in one of the cheaper lots. All in all, the Intercontinental is a great hotel and the location can't be beat. Just know before you go that it's the little things that are going to add up during your stay so plan accordingly.";4;7;3;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1129;9/16/2009;3e0lBvneXDifNOAfJhB2Nw;-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA;"The Intercontinental Chicago needs a lesson in Feng Shui. The room with double beds was small (not surprising considering it is a hotel in the city). Unfortunately the trick of using mirrors to expand a room was used ineffectively. Right next to the bed was very large mirror that took up practically the whole wall. I swear I didn't sleep well because of that. The only thing that the mirror accomplished was to highlight the circus like drapes of the room. I happened to like the whimsical decor but I didn't like having bad dreams. Unlike the mirrors in the bedroom, the Intercontinental is in an excellent location. It's right on Michigan Avenue and if you're into shopping then you're in luck. Bloomingdale's, Saks and American Girl are right next door. If you need to ride the L train it is also not too far away. The hotel has a fabulous pool fit for royalty. It's olympic sized and surrounded by Spanish tiles. The only thing missing was a poolboy who'll fan you and feed you grapes. Sadly, I was not able to spend some time poolside or in the water.

So, let's start with the mediocre first.  My hotel room was spacious, located in the historic tower  (I guess that's why it seemed that my room hadn't been updated in a very long time).  The bed was not comfortable and the lounge chairs were old and worn.  The rest of the furnishings were old and very used to the point of having drawer fronts askew on the desk and doors that wouldn't open properly on the TV stand.  Like I said, with a hotel of this reputation and price, I expect a comfy bed, some chairs that don't look like they've been around since 1964 and furniture that isn't out of grandma's attic. Then, there's the bathroom.  It's like they may have tried to update it at one point...and then gave up.  I had an impossible time maintaining one water temperature both in my sink and in the shower.  Imagine trading between scalding hot and lukewarm.  Gee, I'm now awake AND I've sustained 3rd degree burns.  AWESOME!  The towels were crustier than sand paper and, come on people, can we please have two-ply toilet paper??  Single ply is what I expect from your much cheaper cousin, the Holiday Inn. The redemption in the hotel room was the large, flat screen TV.  That I did enjoy (along with my $6 bottle of water). Now on to the good stuff...The meeting facilities.  These were simply wonderful.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They accommodated all of my vegetarian meal requests without blinking an eye.  The breakfast buffet was a breakfast lover's dream - everything imaginable and all of it very tasty.  The banquet lunches were quite good and all the meat eaters enjoyed their entrees.  The rooms where we had our meetings were well maintained and very clean.  Temperature was nicely maintained as well.  I would highly recommend their meetings services and facilities.   Of course, in the end, you're paying for the location.  Yeah, that can't be beat.  It's within walking distance of just about everything the Mag Mile has to offer - great restaurants, bars, shopping...";3;2;2;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

(4)  Comfy bed, but kind of scratchy sheets. (5)  Fancy looking bath products but I didn't really like them. HOWEVER...the location really can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Avenue.  About two blocks from the river.  A ~10 minute walk to most train lines.

First off, the hotel from the exterior is very impressive and the hotel is in a prime location right on Michigan Ave in walking distance to shopping and across the street from major bus lines.  Close to major sightseeing spots.  Overall, a prime location. According to a friend who came here for work, the meeting rooms are very fancy.  Except I wasn't here to use anything but the rooms and lobby. Apples to apples, for their 4+ star hotel rating it was an okay experience.  I was bumped to a suite which hey, I'm not gonna complain about!   Except a few things I found oddly sub-par - the picture quality and sound of the flat screen TV were very poor and the channel line up was very limited.  It was the shabbiest TV reception I've ever encountered at a hotel.  Even my 1 star hotel experience in Spain had better TV reception.  Each day I ended getting charged incorrectly by housekeeping for allegedly taking things out of the snack bar (which I did not).  The Ipod dock for my alarm clock did not work.  The Business Center which is contracted out to a third party, messed up my printing job and double charged me. Otherwise, the hotel is very impressive from the outside and opens up to a spacious and busy lobby when you walk in.  The decor is a little bland and old-fashioned but otherwise everything about my room comfortable and what you'd expect.   Some of the employees are polite and helpful, but not to any greater extent than what you'd encounter at Days Inn.  And some employees were brusque and not as helpful.  Overall, I thought the customer service was just meh. I would say this hotel was solid but I was not impressed.  I realized after my stay here that I am perfectly happy with a recently renovated room at 2 or 3 star non-boutique hotel with a younger, more modern decor.  Because that's usually where I stay as a budget savvy traveller.";3;1;1;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

I came here on a family trip, where the parents got a single room with a king-sized bed, and my sister and I shared a room with two queen-sized beds.  Despite the fact that the two rooms were the same price, there was a huge disparity in the quality.  The single room was much, much nicer, from the view to the coffeemaker to the furniture.  The double room was not much nicer than what I would expect from a Holiday Inn.   I agree with the previous reviewer that the placement of the mirror was bizarre to the point of distraction.  It was on the wall right next to one of the beds.  Personally, I tend to make good use of hotel mirrors when getting ready in the morning, and it's usually near a desk or something.  This particular mirror was completely useless and only served to try and make the room look bigger.  I noted that the mirror was in a more logical spot in the single room. I think my main problem with my room was that they had the kind of toilets you have in public restrooms, with the metal handle that comes up rather than a toilet tank with a flush handle on the side.  It just felt cheap, and it was leaky, so we had to grab it with a towel to avoid getting sprayed with toilet water every time we flushed.  It just wasn't what I expected from the Intercontinental.  Also, I found it really annoying that you have to scan your room card just to open the minibar.  We wanted to keep our bottled water in there, but we were afraid of getting charged, so we just drank it at room temperature. On the plus side, all the staff were really nice.  As mentioned above, the pool is fantastic.  I went once in the evening and again in the morning, and I had to share a lane both times, but it wasn't overly crowded.  It would have been useful to know beforehand that the pool is free for guests, but the gym costs $12.   Overall, I'm happy with the hotel considering that it was only $106 a night on Hotwire, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to pay full price for it.";3;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1138;6/9/2009;me2Hu5uxY;Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ;"Stayed here for my first anniversary and loved it. You really can't beat the location. As other folks have noted, the Intercontinental is really TWO buildings - the historic tower, and the addition, or ""new tower"" (I'm using the term ""new"" loosely), which is just to the north. The main hotel entrance is in the new tower, and that's where you'll check in, visit the concierge, etc. We had a corner room in the new tower, and it was great. Not large, by any means, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated (one window also opened!). Everyone from the bellhop to the check-in counter staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was flaky, but not a big deal. That said, the real allure of the Intercontinental is the historic tower. It has charm and history in spades. The first several floors are simply amazing. Each floor is decorated and painted in a medieval or renaissance manner which is astounding in detail. There are several small fountains, murals, nooks and crannies to explore. It's an entirely different experience from the new tower, and I feel sorry for the folks who stay at the hotel and never see the original building. We didn't stop at the hotel bar, but we did check out Eno, which is the wine, cheese and chocolate bar on the ground floor of the historic tower. The place is pricey, but fun if you're feeling indulgent. There are separate reviews of Eno on Yelp as well. The only other drawback was the expensive parking, which was over fifty a night. Keep in mind that parking costs are not included if you're booking the hotel thru a third party travel website.";4;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

My idea was to get a great night's sleep and be able to get ready for her wedding day in a beautiful setting. The Intercontinental lived up to all of my hopes. The Intercontinental takes classic hotel charm to a whole new level. The lobby is magnificent and the entire experience makes it worth every dollar spent to stay there. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the bathrooms are huge! A definite benefit when getting ready for a wedding. 2 things I really loved about this hotel: When our mini-bar fridge started wheezing and whining at 12AM, they sent a repairman up immediately to fix it. Instead of fixing it in the room and keeping us up for the 45 minutes it would take, he actually brought a whole new fridge and switched the broken one out in less than 10 minutes. Sleep lost: none! Second, there's a Starbucks in the lobby. As any Starbucks addict will tell you, being able to get your morning coffee in your pajamas is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Location is great if you're an out-of-towner, rooms are comfortable, service is excellent, and the decor is beautiful. If you can afford it and are looking for more of a classic hotel vs. a modern boutique hotel, definitely stay here on your next trip to the city.";5;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

I was in the historic tower which was nice, but unfortunately they only had 2 elevators to my floor, which made the wait quite bad some days.  The room itself was roomy and clean with a nice bed and tv/entertainment center.  Things were always clean. They charged for internet which was a pain since I was there for so long.  Also, the gym had a $18 one time fee which got you access to the pool (see other reviews...it is historic and nice) and a decent workout room. The service was good but I did not ask too much of them since I used yelp for most of my dining.

The room was nice, the bed was comfortable for 2, the flat panel TV was large (32"" or bigger), and everything else seemed to be up to par with a nice hotel. The location is the one thing it really has going for it. Right on Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the river, you'll get to pretty much everything from here on foot if you want to. But then there's the downsides. The ""high-speed internet access"" was a $13 per day wireless setup. When a hotel costs $350 per night for a room (full price, not what I paid), I'd expect that the internet access be reasonably priced if not free. $13 is ridiculous. And it wasn't all that ""high-speed"" either. On top of that, everything in the room had a price. Want a bottled water? That'll be $6.95 please. Forgot your toothbrush? Only $3 for this generic brush-on-a-stick. Grab a Coke out of the ""Refreshment Center?"" For $3.75, no problem! The drapes definitely didn't keep the light out as well as I'd hope, just as someone else mentioned. The towels were average, there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up, and the remote for the TV was near useless. A few people mentioned that the water in the shower/sink would constantly change temperature, and I noticed the same thing in my room (I just love having my warm shower turn into a scalding hot shower).

I wont say it was terrible but I have experienced better. It is a good thing I didn't have to pay for the stay or I would have been really mad. I had a standard room, it was clean and nicely decorated. In another review I saw someone complain about a chair with stuffing spilling out. I don't know if I was in the same room, but I also had a chair with stuffing hanging out. However, the leather that the chair was covered with was amazing, I only sat in that chair. I don't blame them for not getting rid of it and I don't think that it could be repaired. The internet is outrageously overpriced 14.95 per 24 hours. I was in desperate need of internet so I bit the bullet and signed on (I am responsible for incidentals). They had to take my card for incidentals and said they would put a $50 hold on my account. The second day I was there they had put additional holds on my account. I went to talk to the front desk about it. I am a veteran of the Restaurant industry and I know that treating people badly never gets you what you want, so even when complaining I am always calm, polite, and patient. In discussing the issue with the front desk they were polite and attentive but ultimately treated me like I was stupid. Kept saying there was nothing they could do about canceling the hold, I would have to call my bank. In the end I realize that the issue resulted from my not being informed. At check in I signed a form, I asked to see a copy of that form, it clearly explained there would be a $125 hold placed for each day that I stayed. A little excessive if you ask me. But why couldn't the front desk just explain to me that that was hotel policy? I would have understood. Instead they acted like they had no idea, and claimed there was nothing they could do. I was there for two nights, and did not want to pay $30 for internet access, so I only signed on the one day. At check out I made it a point to mention that the only incidentals would be the one day of internet, and confirmed that the holds would be credited back to me less one day on internet. Then the front desk tells me the internet was complementary! WTF it would have been nice to know that when I checked in!!!!!!!!

The three stars represent my persepective as a paying customer, not as someone with an expense account (I would give them four stars from that perspective). First of all, the staff here are fabulous. My room was spotless every night when I returned to it. The banquet staff who catered our seminar were cheerful and seemed to honestly care that we were getting good service. Food was kept hot and replenished regularly, and the service was seemless. In that respect we were well taken care of. The service itself was definitely 5 stars. I do feel, for this caliber of hotel, that the management nickles and dimes its customers, however. My room was almost three hundred a night, and along with that cost, I had to pay $17.99 for wi-fi access, a bottle of Evian in my room was priced at $7, a 375ml bottle of Clos de Bois in the mini bar was priced at $24 (come on man! this stuff is just two steps up from jug wine), and they wanted $5 for a toothbrush, which most hotels give away for free as a courtesy to harried travelers who forgot theirs. We didn't bring enough power strips for the seminar and was charged $25 per day to use one of thiers. Had I the time, I would have just run to Office Depot to buy one instead of spending $100 of my company's money that could have gone into my bonus check. Lame. The location is very convenient, with lots of stores and restaurants nearby, but the area is a bit to hoity toity for my tastes over the span of 4 days.

As in, 2 of the 3 nights were miserable because there was no sleeping to be had.  Yes, we should have asked the front desk, but the first night I had no idea it wouldn't turn off, the second night I was so exhausted that I just passed out, and the third night we asked the room service guy who said he could call engineering after unsuccessfully trying to turn that damn fan off.  Sigh.  But the room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and everyone we dealt with were super helpful.  One weird thing: They have a little basket of snacks atop the minibar for sale, and mixed in with that, is an ""Intimacy Kit."" I don't know why, but I was a little creeped out by condoms/lube sitting in between snickers and doritos.";3;0;0;2;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

The conference facilities are nice, and what one would expect from a hotel located in a downtown district. The rooms were clean, and updated with a contemporary look. The lobby is large and open. The pros: -location -staff is very helpful and friendly -lobby bar is lively and serves decent drinks The cons: -the wifi access throughout the facility is spotty and extremely cumbersome. Being there for a conference, I was also working. I needed reliable access for the multiple devices I travel with. One can login as a guest in one's room, but when one tries to login on the conference levels, the same network is either unavailable or unusable. Same is true when trying to access via the lobby -- there is a separate network, apparently, for each of these areas. My iPhone was virtually unusable via wifi outside of my room, same for my iPad. The 3G access is awful as well. Text messages between myself and a colleague (also staying at the same hotel) were spotty -- either not arriving at all or taking several minutes to arrive. If you're considering staying here as a business traveler, I would recommend one of the many other options in the immediate vicinity. Obviously, based on the above, I place a premium on broadband internet access which has colored this review. Fast, reliable access is a must for me and the hotel fell woefully short in this regard. That said, it was a perfectly acceptable experience outside of the wifi issues, and based on the moderate price, might be a good choice for those looking for a room in the heart of the magnificent mile.

There is a lot about the hotel that is good -- even wonderful. But there are also some downsides. The front desk, concierge, and bell staff are phenomenal. They are friendly, attentive, and move the seemingly endless lines very quickly. They are that same combination of assertive and nice that characterizes most Chicagoans, and they remind me why I fell in love with Chicago in the first place so long ago. The maid staff falls into this category as well, when you run into them, and everyone of these people deserve a hefty tip and a round of applause. The lobby showcases Rush bar, a rushed place that is constantly packed with patrons and guests of the hotel, and the staff flurries about as quickly as possible, slinging overpriced drinks while holding a terse smile and their breath. I can't blame them for their stress, but they need a few extra helpers on hand. The rooms are basic but nice. No flat screens or iPod docks to be found, but the beds are comfortable, and the blankets are plentiful. I asked to be on an upper floor and was given a room on the 39th, with a lake view, which was lovely. However, the windows either don't seal well or are too thin, because it seems there is no sound dampening at all between you and the Magnificently loud Mile at your feet. The detractions I have for the hotel are more on the conference side. The food, while pricey, is supremely bland. I had salmon one night, chicken the next, and a vegetarian dish the following, and they all tasted exactly the same. I found this disturbing, to say the least. In addition, the conference rooms are freezing. When you are sitting on your duff for 8 to 9 hours a day, your circulation needs a bit of help from the temp gauges, and these rooms do not afford it. Bring a coat. Better yet, bring a sleeping bag. I would stay here again, but I would not plan another event here. I recommend it for a pleasure trip to the city. The location can't be beat, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and walkable places are worth every dime.";3;4;4;4;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Additionally, the location almost cannot be beat.  It's on Michigan Avenue in the heart of almost everything.  You have a great view of the city, you can walk just about everywhere, and it is possible to have a lake view as well.

I work for a nonprofit organization that chose to move its fundraising gala to the Marriott from another Chicago hotel. Being a new venue, and ne to the organization and planning this particular event the combination of Amy (Sales Manager) and Christina (Event planner - I don't think that's her exact title) made everything easy and seemless. They were wondreful to work with and the night-of, Christina practically bent over backwards to go the extra mile for us, that's for sure! I really can't say enough nice things- from the tasting to the planning to settling the bill, everything went very smoothly. I woudl say if you're planning an event (conference, dinner, wedding, etc.) this is a good bet. The location is perfect for those who work/live downtown and for those visiting. It's pretty much in the heart of everything. The recent rennovation has made the hotel very colorful and modern, yet still very tasteful. The ballrooms can be modern, elegant, whatever you want them to be. The dinner was amazing and if you get a chance, be sure to include the desserts all made by hand. They are absolutely to die for! Best pastry chef ever! Apparently, everything is made in the hotel and is locally sourced as much as possible. The hotel even has its own butcher shop. I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to sound like an ad. If it balances out the review a little, I will say that the rooms were nice, but not exceptional.

The guest rooms are small and the one I was in had not yet been remodeled so it felt tired and old.  Room service for simple items took forever and no one ever did show up with the extra blanket that I requested.

The beds and down comforters were quite the highlight.  I overslept a few times, and like to think this was the reason. While the pool and hot tub were standard and ordinary, I was surprised to find how awesome the health club was.  I expected to find three treadmills, two barbells and a situp contraption.   To my delight I found a cardio room of 20 machines, and a completely separate free weight area with about 40 machines, barbells and dumbbells -- in a hotel??  That's almost as good as any nearby gym. And, yes, the lobby is busy, well appointed and not too stuffy.  Tons,of plush furniture flanked by a bar, Starbucks, and the busy din of travelers milling about. While there are better hotels in the area (Park Hyatt, Peninsula, Drake, etc.), we all can't afford that - so this is a good compromise.  All in all, it was a postive experience in a recommended hotel.  I would stay here again. My only complaints would be the general noise and loudness of the area, the hotel's lack of WiFi and the cramped hotel room bathrooms.  Even being 43 stories up, the noise of the streets below still felt a bit loud at times.  For a popular convention hotel such as this not to have free WiFi is kind of embarrassing.  The bathrooms are TINY.  I couldn't even open and shut the door without completely maneuvering around the sink and toilet.  This bathroom rivals NYC for petiteness.";4;2;2;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Their suites were an interesting concept.   A 2 bedroom suite was actually one huge room with bar and a dining area/living area, and a single hotel room attached, sort of like a guestroom.   The views from the 43rd floor was breathtaking  - all of Chicago RIGHT THERE... WAY DOWN BELOW.  Given my fear of heights, this was not the best set up for me, with floor to ceiling windows, but it was indeed beautiful. A little inconvenient was the way their elevators work.  With 6 elevators, you'd think there would be more elevators working the 45 floors, but it always seemed to be my elevator stopping at every floor to pick more people up on the way down.  Strange.... The bathrooms are a bit small for the size of the rooms, and while they had granite countertops, that was the only noteworthy thing.  Toiletries are supplied, and there is a blowdryer if you want.  But no bathrobes or other special items you'd find at what I would consider a 5-star hotel. The bed at Hyatt McCormick was more cushy - but that said - with my back problems, the beds at  this Marriott gave me a better night's sleep and I felt great the next morning, whereas at the Hyatt's bed, I always woke up in pain.  I'm not sure why.... but the Marriott bed was SUPERB for me.  Go figure. The entire hotel is non-smoking, so that should be kept in mind if you smoke.......... Room Service is efficient and fast.  The coffee was actually quite good, served in a thermos, with two glasses of water accompanying it, and arriving within 30 minutes of ordering.  GOOD. In any case, the location can't be beat.   The hotel in itself and the rooms are nice, and the views are fantastic. If staying in Chicago, and you're wanting to be close to the nightlife, restaurants, etc - - this would be an ideal choice.   Incidentally, it is right across the street from Joe's Prime Steakhouse, which I yelped earlier. http://www.yelp.com/biz/…";4;2;0;1;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1203;5/10/2010;loxllaclbqXg-HoKrPdYYw;Zet-9TNC6Hfcdq1Zg80X-Q;"Agreed. Location is great.  But there are also a lot of other hotels in the same area.  I stayed at this location for a convention being held at the venue.  If I had a choice I would have stayed elsewhere...for the following reasons: - Rooms are tiny.  They have updated the decor but doesn't make up for the closet feeling room. - Separate charge for internet service.  If some motels can provide free wifi why can't you when I pay 3x as much for a stay here? - Split elevators.  They have separate elevators for floors 1-28 and another set of elevators for the higher floors.  Confusing if it's your first day there or you switched your room several times like I did. - Broken ac/heater functions.   - Foul smell bathrooms.  Like they used a dirty cloth and no cleaning solvents to wipe down the inside of the bathrooms.  Ewwww On a positive note, the staff was wonderful and really accomodating.  If only the building and amenities reflected the cost and service - I would be a happy camper.";2;3;3;2;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Central to plenty of great restaurants, you are walking distance from shopping, and really anything else you may want or need. I even walked to the shore of the lake, it was beautiful. There is a full bar in the lobby, which seemed cool to me at the time, but I never got a great vibe from it. However, the bartender there was very kind and remembered me from the night before. Very tip-able staff. My room was beautiful, and very clean. Plenty of amenities. Kind of a small bathroom and nothing spectacular, but it got the job done. Downsides... No free wi-fi = stupid! The positive to this was that it forced me to learn how to connect via bluetooth through my cell phone... nerd central.   Like other posts have said the valets were a touch on the inattentive side, but they were all right.   One thing that really annoyed me was that most cabbies had no clue where this Marriott was located! There is another Marriott within walking distance so I think it is rather confusing... but really. That isn't the hotel's fault, but it is something worth mentioning. The ball room was great for the awards ceremony I attended, and again the staff was very accommodating.

I was here for a conference and I must say that I was impressed by some of the renovations. The colors look very modern, hip and trendy. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing but the hotel did a great job of placing signs to assist those who may have gotten off track. The food served for every meal, break, and the reception was great and well thought out. It didn't feel like the hotel food of ""yesteryear"" . A few negatives: the hotel didn't anticipate the need for hangers for the coat racks on a cold November day so people were tossing their coats on top of the racks while staff stood about and eventually got more hangers. Escalators were not in service and the stairwell needed to access the floor where the sessions were being held was kind of scary and dingy. Lunch serving staff seemed very unhappy, many people weren't offered drinks with their lunch or coffee.

1231;8/8/2012;ZUoVhMdFECYN92Be63ZF3Q;kvFWIY7f_0J43_nxhUb5jA;"Alright, friends.  I'm going to be as straightforward as possible.  This place is a dump.  It's just gross.  I'm tempted to leave it at this, but I feel obligated to let you know why this place is an avoid-at-all-costs establishment. The premise of my stay at the Hilton was a work trip for BF about a week ago.  His firm paid for his room, and I got to tag along (yay trip to Chi!).  I usually stay at Embassy Suites (another Hilton chain, ironically), but since one cannot argue with a free hotel stay, one goes where one is told. As I mentioned, this was a business trip, and the convention was held in the hotel, so it was packed. We walked in and pushed through the barrage of company polo shirt clad attorneys, and wives that stepped right out of a Talbots catalog, to the reservation desk.  I noticed a few people taking photos of their kids in the lobby, which is sort of a grand foyer kind of deal.  I presume most people think that this is a gorgeous area; I'll just say it's not my taste.  Were it 1984, and I was Janet Jackson on tour, I probably would have been a little more impressed.   We make our way to the reservation desk, which appears to be reminiscent of a Cedar Point queue line.  After our long and strenuous quest, we make it to the desk, where we are asked for BF's credit card, for the purpose of ""holding the room,"" and the card was not to be charged. Keep this tidbit in your mind, folks.  Since the room was supposedly prepaid for, we were a little confused, but obliged, so as not to hold up the line any longer. (Insert ""That 70s Show"" transition with BF and I dancing in acid washed jeans and over-sized shirts) We return to check into our room. Whoa! Throwback. This place had obviously not been updated since the 80s. Not to mention the fact that I don't think the AC had been serviced since the 80s, since we walked into a brick wall of heat immediately after stepping off the elevator. Once we actually get into our room, I acknowledge the small amount of nostalgic charm, and since I had just rode back from Wrigleyville on the El, after many beers, I head to the bathroom. It's fair to mention I'm quite a germophobe.  I spray everything with my TSA approved bottle of Lysol, and whip out Clorox wipes.  This place was enough to make BF (the complete opposite of me) cringe. First off neither the drain in the sink, nor the tub, worked.  The toilet was a push-lever model, straight from the industrial building store. Nothing appeared to be cleaned well, as I noticed water marks everywhere. The towels were dingy and some had dirty spots.  Shudder. Like the drains, the AC didn't work either.  I had called maintenance, who was supposed to send someone up ""right away,"" however they were a no show.  Perhaps they were attending the soiree that the housekeepers were having in the linen room down the hall.  Everyone was having a grand time... laughing, being merry, being obnoxiously loud. It reminded me of the sort of party Gatsby could pull off.   Day 2, and our maid, who, I think may have both been deaf and not an English speaker (honestly, not trying to be mean here), came to clean.  Except the fact that I was in the room. Sleeping. One would expect the housekeeper to leave a sleeping guest lie. Not so. She carried on with banging things around in the bathroom, and then discovered the drain. She apparently couldn't clean the bathroom with the malfunctioning drain, so she decided to tell us we needed to call maintenance right then. BF was trying to explain that we were napping and would call later, but she was insistent to the point that she came into the living area of our room, picked up the phone, and tried showing us what she wanted by dialing a bunch of numbers and then slamming the phone down. We politely tried to shoo her out, and she finally got the hint that we were trying to rest. Day 3, maintenance finally comes, and explains to me that the AC is not broken, but rather there is a secret trick to making it work!  Alas, my troubles are solved!  How stupid of me, I should have known that you have to press two buttons down, while turning the thermostat down, waiting for the screen to say something, and then releasing the buttons. Very user friendly.  He also fixes the drain at this point, but makes a huge mess. I called to have them clean it up, but again, nobody came. Checking out was the highlight of the trip. Until we realized that BFs card was charged for the room. They proceeded to ""fix"" the problem by transferring the charges to his boss's card, until two days later, and a charge is showing as an overdraft.

Luckily we booked this place through Priceline and got a good deal, but if I were paying the regular rate for this hotel I think I would have been pretty disappointed. The hallways were kind of dimly lit here, so overall it just wasn't a very inviting hotel. One thing that I did like was that the room actually had two bathrooms, which was something I hadn't seen before.

The Hilton name implies a certain level of quality.  Yeah, but that died when Conrad Hilton passed away.  Hilton is going down rapidly and this hotel proves my point. In a city like Chicago, with all the top-shelf hotels one may choose from, this is one to avoid like the plague! The carpet in the common areas is filthy, worn and threadbare.  The chairs in the common area as the same:  dirty, worn and threadbare, and so 40 years ago.  The styles are out-of-date, the colors are sad, the paint is blistering and peeling, and overall the hotel is just depressing!  And yes, I know the historic background to this hotel and no, the 'out-of-date' motif is not my misunderstanding of the property's history.  Trust me, it's awful! The bank of elevators is stunning in its lack of thought and design.  There are ten elevators, five on each side.  As you press the ONLY elevator request button (yes, one button for all ten elevators) one notices the paint that is blistering, cracking, peeling, dirty, nicked and overall more like you'd expect to see in a horror film psychiatric hospital.  And  the detail of the ceiling's woodwork?  It's been painted so many times the relief and detail is filling in with layers upon layers of paint.  Yuk! The room itself has a nice modern flat screen television with beds that are 30 years out-of-date, bathrooms that are out-of-date and feel unclean containing soap and shampoo selections that disappoint.   The breakfast buffet in Buckingham's is another disappointing feature.  I went there three times as there was little other choice.  On Saturday I could tell the oatmeal was left over from Friday, as were the 'eggs' if you want to call them eggs.  How could I tell?  They were dry and almost had a crust on them from being in storage overnight.  NOT appetizing. The exhibit halls are dungeon-like as they are down in the bowels of the hotel. Columns block walking paths and views.  The exhibit halls become a labyrinth and, as a result, it is difficult to find much of anything.  Here for a meeting?  Good luck!  Planning a meeting here?  AVOID it. Overall, this hotel is simply as sad and depressing as it gets.  This is the type of hotel where one would expect to find the businessman (or woman) swinging from a bed sheet while hanging from the shower head in a last-ditch effort to escape this depressing property.

Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was huge. They had a well stocked mini bar but the key was hidden from me and I was not allowed in.

Beautiful high ceilings, gilt wood, lobby, pool (though it closed early), two smaller hot tubs, work out center, and room with city views. My boyfriend and I recently stayed there on valentine's day (which is a thursday, so...) for only $90 through priceline. The hotel just isn't at capacity in the winter and you can get great rates. We wandered through the spacious, empty lobby and stumbled on a grand ballroom, complete with balconies and elaborate, glass chandeliers. Great space for a wedding. Be aware... parking is almost $50 a night, truly a rip-off!! But the location can't be beat. Other downsides: most of the hotel's restaurants close in winter and Kitty O'Shea's, while open until 11 for food, was just not that good. But extremely affordable! Breakfast menu from room service was the only real disappointment, boring and veerry basic We were placed on the ""Executive Floor"", which I would almost certainly request if you can. They are higher floors with much better views. Little details in the service make a big difference to me. For example, I called to request tea in the morning and they brought up an enormous selection promptly, complete with creamers and to-go cups. I felt like Michael Jackson!! that's what they would give Michael Jackson. People say his star has fallen, but wouldn't you just poop yourself if he was staying in your hotel?? A note - You can buy passes to their gym/pool, not that I would ever work out in a million years. But some might. Some might. A 3-day pass to extensive facilities within walking distance to the Loop was $15, extremely reasonable. Back to the room: Warm colors, dark wood, smallish space, freshly tiled bathroom, white linens and comforter. Cable, but no DVD player.

I asked about a room with a view, but it was another $25/night, so I passed. My room did not have the infamous (?) two bathroom setup, but my one bathroom was just fine. My water pressure was great, even up on the 19th floor, and my fixtures weren't tarnished and looked really nice, unlike what some of the other reviewers experienced. The bed was super comfortable, and I loved how white and crisp the sheets and duvet were. And their pillows - oh my God, I wanted to steal them all, they felt like clouds under my head. The location of the hotel was nice, just a few blocks away from the Harrision red line stop, so it is super convenient to get to/from places pretty quickly. What I really liked was the check out process. Maybe other hotels have this, but I've never experienced it. Not only did I not have to wait in line to check out, like the mass of people that were doing so when I left on Sunday morning, but I was able to print out my boarding pass for free! All I had to do was check out through my TV, then send my boarding pass to their print station in the lobby. Genius, and pain free.

On a personal level as a guest: 2009 - I had to stay a night for work and I found the room, as well as the hotel, to be dark, out-dated, and almost haunted.  I was so freaked out in my room, which was a basic king room, that I stayed up and watched The Hangover and ordered a pizza through room service.  I ended up sleeping with the light on (yes, I am scared of the dark and this hotel room didn't help) 2011 - Stayed here the last night of my conference and got a pretty sweet room.  It was a King Jr. Suite and it had a view of museum campus and the lake.  Too bad I was working and couldn't really enjoy it for long.  I still found the room to be small, but less dark and out-dated than 2009. Either way, this would NOT be my first pick if I was visiting Chicago.  The hotel has a lot of history, and certainly has one of the most beautiful ballrooms I have seen as well as amazing suites - both the Conrad and the Imperial Suites are breath-taking, but an average person would not be paying to stay there.  If anything, I say visit the hotel on a tour, but dont' pay the money to stay there unless 1) you get a great deal or 2) can afford one of the suites.  While the hotel isn't centrally located to many Chicago attractions it is close to museum campus, the infamous Buddy Guy Legends, and is a short cab ride to the Magnificent Mile. On a professional level as a meeting planner: 1) The exhibit space isn't ideal for exhibitors especially if you are on the Lower Level because of all the columns.  The meeting rooms, with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd floor, are small and cramped and make you feel like you're in elementary school again. 2) The prices are ridiculous - I have never been to a property that charges so much for a gallon of coffee!  We definitely had to have a serious conversation with them in regards to pricing for items such as coffee, internet, and electrical.  As a planner, consider yourself warned, and be prepared to discuss bringing prices down and compromising in certain areas. 3) The staff - everyone from the front desk, facilities, banquets, the blue coats, to covention services and even the chef and GM are beyond amazing!  I have worked meetings at a lot of properties and the Hilton Chicago staff are definitely up there.  They were extremely accommodating, professional, and a true pleasure to work with.   If I am still with the association in 2014, I look forward to going back just to be able to work with their staff.";3;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

John McCain and his entourage were in the hotel for a while in the afternoon and evening.  Security was there, and they did a good job of not inconveniencing people who were there for other reasons.  Supposedly when this hotel was built, it was the biggest in the world.  That's not hard to believe and the staff manages things well but if I could pick a hotel for next time, I'd pick a newer one that was maybe a mile further north.";2;2;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The colors are very warm and comforting as are the staff and everyone that greets you. My room had two beds and two bathrooms which was a bit excessive, but it comes with the whole upgrade. The view was decent as I was on the 24th floor, but I was caddy cornered between two points of the huge building that jut out and it was kind of a limited view. The room was very clean and everything was top class as Hiltons usually are. One thing of note was the gym. It was absolutely huge.

Even though the weights and machines may be a little old, there is HUGE variety for a hotel gym and even a mini track that goes around all the equipment.

I had a corner room which provided great views through multiple windows, but I sense that it could be a little drafty on cold, windy winter days.  Overall though, very cozy and comfortable.  I'd recommend this hotel for out of town visitors, especially those with kids because there's room to run around in the lobby floors, and great access to the park and lake.";4;2;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

I got over it.   One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices.  Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.";4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Their energy is contagious so, of course, I go in and buy something for everyone in my party. Before we join the madness at Kitty O'Sheas, I go check-in. Lady at the counter was really nice. Check-In process took less than 5 minutes. They even had arranged all clocks at the rooms to change automatically for day light savings. Room is big, spacious, clean... so is the bathroom. Mini bar (you can ask for the key when checking-in), TV, desk, big enough closet, and more features to make your stay comfortable.  Oh, but do bring your own soap, the one they have is brutal on your nails and skin.   Back downstairs, St. Patrick's celebration has intensified. Kitty O'Sheas' is packed, with a line of people waiting outside, without and estimated seating time.

We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there.

He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha.

Was told that they were overbooked, so I had a choice of a ""parlor room"" or a smoking room for the first night (then get moved for the next two), since no non-smoking rooms were left. The parlor room was supposed to be ""better"" and have a bed that was ""closer to the ground"" (??) and they offered to discount my rate. Fine. I get to the room and my key doesn't work. Go downstairs to get a second key. Also doesn't work. Finally they send someone from security to meet me there to let me in. When I get in, I realize that the room. Has. No. Bed. They had given me the living room half of an executive suite (kitchen with sofas). I called downstairs about this and they offered to bring in a roll-away. Incredible. Had a long call with the manager on duty who kept insisting that they had no more non-smoking rooms for the night. After a while, he caved and let me have a non-smoking room from a block of rooms that some other group had reserved which was not being used. So they had extra non-smoking rooms all along? Why the charade? So this new room was fine. Of course, I had to move for the next two nights. To try to make up for the issue the first night, the next morning's manager promised that they had given me a ""really nice room"". It turned out to be a corner room with great views. But. The heater didn't work. (I didn't try to change rooms again.) After all that, when I was checking out, they had charged me the original rate for all three nights! The person checking me out asked how my stay was. I said, ""Well..."" and then they comped me for one night. I spoke with some other people staying in the hotel, and apparently the issue with the heaters was widespread. In the middle of winter in Chicago, they have broken heaters...";1;1;0;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

When we first checked in, we were told that the non smoking room that we reserved is not available and there is no other room available.  When we get to the room, the smell of the room was pretty bad...so we asked the front desk to check again. He told us that there is one room available, but it was a living room of a suite. But   the living room has been secluded now from the suite and the sofa can be turned into a bed. Hello!?!??! Did I pay for the room/bed or a living room with sofa? I could have stayed at a friend's apartment (for free!!) and sleep on her sofa if I wanted to do that.   Pros: - Looks good from the outside (inside totally not worth it) - Close to the millennium park (about 6-8 blocks?) But I am sure there's better hotels that are closer to downtown and better for the price. Cons: - Got a smoking room even though I reserved non-smoking room. When I read reviews online, it seems like this is their common practice to do this. Beware!!   - Room is dirty (There was a BIG spider on the wall when we got into the room) - Some portions of the carpet was WET (Gross!!) - Bed, decorations, bathroom are OLD. They really need to get updated. - Internet is $7.50 per hour, with no business center to check your email (Hotels like hampton inn can offer $130 a night with free internet and breakfast...and I don't know why Hilton can't...pretty ridiculous) - They seriously nickel and dime you for everything!! To leave your luggage for a couple of hours, you have to pay $2 per bag. - Beware of the extra charges. They slip me a bill for $6.40 for I do not know what. I called the front desk and asked what the charge is for, and they asked me if I took something from the bar and I told them no. Then they just dismiss it (imagine if you had not called). - Arrogant and full of attitude staff Definitely not a place I want to stay the next time I come to Chicago. Totally not worth the price!! Everyone should just avoid it. Every staff has some kind of attitude like this Hilton was the best hotel in the city (maybe in the late 80s or early 90s) but I don't think it is up to par with other hotel I've stayed in.

They are one of those clubs where Friday night is Latino night, Saturday is african american night, and then they tend to switch it up every other week or something?   Last night my friend forwarded me the 'get in free' text from the promoters.  They wouldn't let me in free because it wasn't from the promoter himself. Weird because word-of-mouth marketing is the best way to go. I couldn't believe the money-takers at the front door that night.  I paid $10 to get in there and then I had to put up a fight to go outside for a quick smoke.  He said ""if i let you out, then I have to let everyone out"". I think there should be some kind of law that allows you to go outside for fresh air (or not so fresh air lol). Thought America was a free country but who knows.  I think they missed the whole stamp-on-wrist idea that most clubs do to know who's been in and who hasn't. I then had to beg them again to let me out so I could change my shoes. My feet were literally bleeding from my shoes.  They wouldn't. So I took my shoes off and started walking through the club barefoot. That got their attention and they let me go out and come back in. WOW!  It's odd because every other time I had been there they let people outside. I knew it was because of the dudes at the front taking money.  Who the hell hired them? When it's a popular night they overcrowd the place.  It gets ferociously hot in there.  One time they sent out a burst of cold air through the club. It was the best 20 seconds of the night.  Just a tease though because it went right back to being hot. Ill go back because Im forgiving :)  But I don't like being disrespected by the front door staff.  They are kind of rude to the customers.

What the?! My girl refused to sign until she got her card back. This went on for twenty minutes.  The birthday girl happened to know one of te bouncers, she told him what was going on.

First of all, there's a dress code apparently (even though my dj friend said there wasn't.)  After some explaining and talking to a bouncer and a manager they let us in with our sneakers as long as I took off my hat.  Awesome bouncer, but right off the bat I find out it's not the kind of place I would normally go to. Secondly, drinks.  It was sponsored by Hennessey that night but unfortunately it didn't do a damn thing for drink prices.  $6 for the average selection of beers and $8 a mixed drink and $9 a shot.  Average prices for some clubs but this ain't exactly the place you can get your ""drink on"" on my budget. Thirdly, Victor ""HOTEL?""  Not only did my friend get the streets mixed up, but we were looking for an actual hotel the whole time.  What's the deal with these places with false-advertisey names? (Like US Beer Company, which is not an actual brewery or anything and they run out of beers a lot of times too.)  Are people actually running out of names for these clubs and bars?  I know it's a ""thing"" but call it ""Victor Club"" or ""Victor you'll never find us in this meat-packing district bar"" or something. There's a couple of little rooms from what I could see, not sure if they were VIP and I believe there was an upstairs as well (which I'm also unsure of its VIP statusness.)  I mostly congregated around the dj stage drinking my anger away.  Apparently they were doing live art somewhere too which I was too late to witness. The music is a moot point because I obviously liked it since my friend was deejaying, so I'm not sure what their normal selection of music is but by the judging of all of Frodo's cousins there looking confused (the Douche Baggins) I got a feeling that they weren't playing what the normal crowd comes to hear.  Parking is valet only unless you're lucky to find a spot (which is nigh impossible.) All in all, the online magazine that was throwing this party is trying new adventurous things and places, but I don't think this particular place is one I'm coming back to.  Two and a half stars.  Hey, it could be great for all I know, but I don't care.  SIX-HOURS.";2;4;2;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

No, I'm being for serious. Ladies. . . . this is definitely not somewhere you want to be walking down the street to alone.  Shoot, men too!

You'll be at the bar trying to get your drink while one half of a dancing couple may be bouncing their butt against your hip.  My face: Not Amused. The speakers are huge and it's hard to be close enough where you can really feel the music and far enough away that you don't that annoying ring in your ears after you leave. Don't you hate that sound? And seating? Forget about it.  The few seats that are around are claimed by the early birds and conquered throughout the rest of the evening by their party.   Overall, the place wasn't my steez at all. I already have issues with paying $10 and up to get into some place to listen to non-live music without anything else included. So, if I'm going to do it I certainly need it to be worth my while.

In fact, everyone here seems to take themselves seriously...from the $10 valet parking in a completely deserted street parking area, to the bouncer complete with list and velvet ropes, to the $100 Jack Daniel bottles with a price markup simply because you're enjoying it VIP styley. Best bet: show up for one of the million open bar parties they have, get there real early because this place gets crazy packed, and bring dirty friends to deter the smooth walkin' illiterate man action that is bound to come your way.";2;3;2;4;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1315;9/6/2010;NlzroGiz3Ofil5O60k2dRg;hIJYkr014SZsXYg7k5ECPw;"I was conflicted on rating this establishment ""A-ok"" or ""Meh"". Frankly, it's possible to experience both in one night depending on what happens.  The Victor Hotel was good, the music was lively, there were a barrage of lovely women dressed beautifully and the music almost seemed to compliment their desire to feel gorgeous and enjoy a night of fun.  To this I salute The Victor Hotel and promise that I will return.   Additionally, I had a chance to have a meeting with Carlos Zambrano, I bought him a glass of red wine, I had never expected that he would be a wine drinker but you know ""Qu'il en soit ainsi, ainsi soit-il"".  I digress, this experience too increased my fondness of The Victor Hotel. Conversely, The Victor Hotel tried to put one over on me and maybe it is not the establishment per se, maybe its the management, maybe even the staff.  Whomever it was, I was brought down quickly  from a sense of enjoyment to the bitterness of reality.  Bartenders, in my experience in communications both verbal and nonverbal one intentionally expresses amicability and in the service industry it pays off.  Wrong night.  Bartender was not friendly, she threw drinks at me, and she visibly rolled her eyes at me when she could not hear me over the music.  I am not saying here reaction was targeted at me.  In fact, I think everyone likes me and everyone wants to be my friend.  So, I continued on my way and use this yelp review as a sort of awareness blog.  Check your ego at the door.  Oh and ask for an itemized bill.  The Victor Hotel adds both gratuity and service charge...suspect I know";2;6;5;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1316;6/1/2010;mTbZpHRoI7Lpa;7D-LTcZexcDPURfkT_GLLA;"What happened to this place? Victor Hotel has gone the way of so many other clubs. Started off hot, now desperate to make a buck. First, when you arrive, if you don't want to valet your car, then don't drive up to the club on Sangamon. It's a narrow street in the warehouse district with delivery trucks on all sides, making it nearly impossible to turn around. Secondly, after security pats the guys down,  you'll be paying a $20 charge. I came here with a birthday party, and they ""had no record"" of the party, yet the other people who got there before me didn't pay. Hmm. Victor Hotel conveniently has an ATM. This machine also charges you $4.50 per transaction when you withdraw the $20 needed for cover. Seriously, like other reviewers said, this is Chicago. If I am going to a club that makes you wait in line and charges $20, it better be amazing. Instead, $20 gets you what looks like a garage with strobe lights. The sound system is pretty poor here as well. Stand too far back, and you won't hear much. Stand moderately close to the DJ booth and your ears will ring for two days.";2;4;1;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

The negatives:  $10 cover for guys only. Okay...if the place has some people inside. I visited this joint on a Friday night and was a bit  disappointed.  The place was probably about 15% full and the crowd was a bit older/tamer.

The ten dollar cover was a bit annoying since it wasn't particularly crowded and we were inside by 11:00, but I did notice that all of the employees were very friendly and not at all pretentious, which was definitely a nice change.

It was crowded, but I would say the majority of people there were attending a black/white party in the back room.  If it wasn't for that party, I think it would have been empty (except for my friends and I of course).   (edit) Since there was not much else in regards to crowd, even though it was a weekend, I'm going with 2 stars.";2;1;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1321;10/30/2011;Z3DXRNHecF4EsZyPxsufog;HYxG8hz1Gc9CSrrsDRn7ew;"I had never heard of Victor Hotel prior to being invited to celebrate my cousin's birthday here. I was excited to spend a great night with family to celebrate a milestone birthday. However, as soon as I arrived at this place with my sister and brother, our excitement quickly waned. There were so many things that ruined the night that I do not know where to begin, so I will just list them. 1. The valet cost $20. Whenever I get raped like that for parking, I am usually attending an event like a concert not going to a dive that thinks it's a hip club. 2. The line Despite informing the dude at the door that we were attending a birthday party in one of the ""private"" rooms, we were made to wait with others outside in an unnecessary line. The place wasn't even full, so the line was uncalled for and absolutely ridiculous. When the line finally started moving, one of the door guys was going to separate our three-party group by making me wait and letting my brother and sister go ahead. I had to ask him if he was seriously going to separate me from my twin sister! He then let me go with them. We waited in line for 20 minutes! I am over 30. The only time I ever wait in line is for a Prince concert. So, I was not feeling this ""velvet rope"" thing at all! 3. Mandatory coat check Once we finally made it into the club after my brother being frisked and my sister and I having our purses searched, we were informed that we HAD to check our coats! I have never been anywhere that REQUIRED a coat check. After all, we were attending a party in a ""private room,"" so why the need to coat check? The coat check was $4 and we were not allowed to check our three light coats together. Just another rip off and annoyance. 4. The cover charge I have been to some great clubs in Chicago and NYC. I do not mind paying a hefty cover for a legendary DJ like Frankie Knuckles in a nice club or lounge. However, NOTHING about Victor Hotel is great - not the venue, the decor, the crowd or the music! Nothing warranted a cover charge of $30 for men and $20 for women. NOTHING!!! The cover was a another rip off! 5. The customer service The overall attitude of the people who ""work"" at this dump was terrible. The first guy I talked to at the door was a jerk who thought he was important because he was working the door at a third-rate club in the meat packing district that is obviously frequented by people who do not know that there are FAR BETTER places to spend your time and money. When I  tried to ask whether we had to stand in line as guests of a party in a private room, he was very curt and just dismissed me to the line. The second door guy who was going to separate me from my group was also a jerk who joked that I was going to cry if he separated us. It wasn't that serious, but who does that? It is basic club etiquette to let a group enter together, especially a group of three people!!! The cashier had the worst attitude of all. After my brother paid the ridiculous $70 cover for the three of us, she, with a very stank attitude said, ""He needs to give me another $10."" I informed her that 30+20+20 = the $70 he had just given her, and she just said, ""Oh, ok."" Then let my sister and me through. I will say the security guard at the front door who frisked and searched us was cool, as was the lady working the valet at the end of the night. The wait staff for the party did a good job. However, overall the attitude of the main workers was awful and enough alone to make me never return. 6. The ""private"" room The party was in a ""private"" room in the back of the club. However, other club patrons continuously walked through the party. There was no rope or security to stop people from entering the party. I have never experienced anything like it. At times, I could not figure out who belonged and who did not. There was NOTHING spectacular about what I could see of the decor. It looked like a basement with chairs. There was no real ambiance. The lighting was terrible. The room was so dark that we could barely see each other. The music was so loud that we had to shout to be heard in a whisper. 7. The music The DJ was horrendous. There are far better bedroom DJs around Chicago than whoever was spinning. For a Saturday night this was pathetic. The DJ played endless Jeezy, Gucci and Weezy peppered with played out tracks from Justin Timberlake (Rock Your Body) and Usher (Bad Girl). Those songs might have been popular five years ago, but in 2011? Really? The music was far too loud. The blends were non-existent and the overall playlist was a Rap/R&B/Pop hodgepodge that sounded like someone's iPod on random. The only positive thing about this rat trap is its proximity to the expressway because as soon as I arrived, I wanted to go back to my car, hit 90/94 and go home! This was my first and last time going to Victor Hotel.";1;0;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

My initial impression of this place was definitely ""where the heck am I going."" It is located in a fairly desolate area in the west loop and we entered in through the back door. Mix the signage on the front and I thought to myself that it should be called ""Victor Motel"" instead... Inside the place exponentially raises the bar on style and has a definite club/lounge feel. The area itself is very open and had a nice feeling of not being crowded even though we packed it in. The crowd itself was about 50+ of people I knew, so I can't comment on that as everyone was friendly. I did have a few complaints. The first was the requirement that we be stamped for free drinks. This forced me to fight my way back through the crowd even though I had already had a couple rounds without being asked to show anything. Also, they stopped the free drink promo 10 mins early, which ticked off alot of people. (myself included) Otherwise, we did end up getting bottle service and it was by far better than I've been treated elsewhere.

Kara and I are in a cab, fast driver, both of us seriously thought about wearing seatbelt.  I'm getting little scared because we saw dozens of people with golf clubs out on the street? What the?? We go inside, holy cow.  Talk about fancy! Red colors everywhere, nice chairs, and very cozy.  But where is everyone? Maryanna!!!!! You said show up at 8pm so here we are whole two of us here with 3 other people.  Maryanna, if you are going to promote your stuff? You have to be here huh?  We stuck around because you said you be right over soon as you are done with Madonna concert. Free drinks, heck yeah...  I didn't eat before I came, in an empty stomach and I always get in trouble. I drink little more than I should when they offer free drinks as well.  Sure enough. Within one hour, I drank down 4 or 5 vodka and cranberry.  I was feeling it for sure.

I get to work, feeling still drunk.  I should have called in sick. I send my boss a message.  ""I'm not feeling so well""   I tried to go use the bathroom at work but it was so disgusting.  I wasn't going to puke at work bathroom or even thinking about hugging the toilet.  So I needed a plan!

Do you want me to go get you something from Walgreen? Me: (oh shit, she is going to help me out, quick! think of something drastic to say).  Umm I don't know, it's little personal thing you know. Boss:  Are you having cramps? Is it that time of the month?  Funny she makes jokes. Me:  hahaha, I'm laughing but I said no, I told her I have the D'word, (too embarrassed to say it) but I couldn't think of any other excuse.  I didn't want to tell her I drank too much last night and don't want to be lectured about ""responsibility"" Boss: okay go home, feel better. I take few magazines from work and put it in my bag to read over the weekend.  Tell my coworkers I'm leaving for the day. I told them I made up an excuse to our boss.

I give them brief answers and walk outside to flag down a cab.  They follow me outside start talking to me again.  C'mon... cab!  (I'm really not in the mood to talk). I have a piece of bread in my mouth, holding the soup with my right hand, messenger bag on my shoulder, cellphone in my other hand.  These ladies keeps on talking to me, I don't have a free hand to open the cab door so I put doggy bag with soup inside my messenger bag (dumb ass, you know its going to spill) but I wasn't thinking straight okay?   I'm free from the ladies, I get in the cab. Going home finally.  I'm going to puke, dizzy, spinning. Told Mr. Cab driver to hurry! LaSalle and Maple! Okay, I'm home; damn soup did spill in my bag.  My ass is hot from the soup and I open up my bag. Holy shit, look like a fish tank with soup chunks floating everywhere.  Damn it, I don't have time for this. All the magazines are drenched; I throw my bag in the kitchen sink.  I head over to the bathroom.   I'm ready to puke now.  I hover around the toilet for 30 minutes. I don't need to puke any more, puke sensation is gone.   I had to deal with this entire ordeal for nothing?  I cleaned up my bag, dumped rest of the soup that didn't spill in to a bowl.  I ate it and went to sleep for next 8 hours.";4;2;2;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

Of course, being the new club on the block, every model, B-list celeb, and athlete in town was sure to be checking out the spot, leaving the proletariat outside to wait in line for an hour (I must say once I got in I was impressed). I recently went back to Victor for the first time since then, and I like what I see. The interior remains the same, 1950's and 1960's mod furniture (Miesian Barcelona charis, some Le Corbusier, and the bubbly chair whose designer I don't recall), tasteful nude photography, and an overall very colorful atmosphere. What I really like about this place though is the focus on house music, which draws an intense following, particularly on Thursday nights.

Nice, clean, small gym perfect for working off the popcorn, steak, tacos, alcohol and all of that amazing food offered in Chicago. Steakhouse was pretty great as was the free drink upon arrival. Don't forget to read the free time out mag if you have time and if you need ideas. (but I'm sure you've arrived with many.) Extremely helpful hotel staff and probably the best maid service I've ever experienced. It always helps to leave at least a couple of dollars daily! Turndown service was an added bonus as was the little sweet treat that we'd save for the next day. Sb coffee was great if you don't feel like going down the street in the 100+ degree heat first thing in the am. Daily water refill was a bonus, as was the mini-bar fridge that we used--no questions asked. Great for yoghurt or leftovers! Door guys were helpful...just don't be caught carrying one of their umbrellas with you like we did for a couple of days. Because apparently, in Chicago, ""you only believe it when you see it."" How different from Vancouver! Honestly, if you can't afford the trip to NY, this is the place to go and this is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!";5;8;9;9;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

I loved the design and the ""it is what it is, and its good"" attitude. I also love their full-sized Intelligent Nutrients products in the bathroom. It makes me feel like i'm staying at a cool buddy's house instead of a stingy hotel. And cudos to their speedy wifi. many hotels offer free wifi, however, 80% of them are dial-up speeds. The James is an exception. The minibar and the ""help yourself drawer"" is another thoughtful thing they've done. from tequila to heneiken, from contact solution to chapstick.. if you weren't thoughtful enough to bring these essentials yourself and got too cozy to go downstairs, do help yourself. but I'm sure they'll charge you for anything you grab though. but that's fair enough. the bed is so comfyyyyy!! beware once you land yourself on that mattress you will not want to explore the city. but c'mon. the hotel is at the center of everything right off michigan ave. so exploring the city doesn't necessarily mean taking a long hike.";5;3;4;2;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Central location means also easy access to most attractions in Chicago. So going back to food, we took advice most times from the concierge, who each time gave us an excellent address depending on what we wanted to eat. The bedroom itself is very good. It took us a bit of time to get use to the switches for the lights which were not always located at the right spot. Also wifi was very very slow. But for the rest it was as needed.

The concierge was incredible.  He helped us track down the location of a club that didn't seem to be listed in the phone book or online.  He made several phone calls and within just a few minutes he had the address and a cab waiting.   I'm not sure if the bar in the lobby is more affiliated with Primehouse (the restaurant on site, FANTASTIC as well) but I had the best mojito I have ever had in my life in the lobby of The James.  I will never forget that, as I am a total Mojito nazi. Our ONLY complaint about the stay is that the room was incredibly hot, and we had to call to have a fan brought up when we woke up sweating at 4 am.  Otherwise, this was just a perfect stay.  We were treated like royalty, which made us tip like royalty.   I would go back in a heartbeat.";5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

The hotel's location is great as you're within walking distance to most of the touristy areas in the City and only a block or two away from the red line.  It's a perfect hotel in a perfect location and I'm glad I found the hotel on Yelp before I made a reservation at one of those corporate hotels that don't pay attention to the details.  When I travel I want to feel taken care of and this place did its best to make us feel like we home away from home.

I have seen in many of the reviews that everyone raves about the beds.  If you were reading this review to hear otherwise, you are out of luck.  My wife and I have a terrible time sleeping in any bed besides our own, but after a long day of shopping and shows, we fell asleep quickly and easily.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable and comforter soft and warm.  I have never slept in another unfamiliar bed so easily. The room was cleaned twice a day as well.  This was an excellent treat.  We would leave to go shopping and come back to an immaculate room once again.

This was our first visit to Chicago so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Location: This hotel is close to so much. We were a few blocks from the train that we used to go to Wrigley & the airport. We were able to walk to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the beaches. There were shops, and restaurant galore all around us. It was raining the one day, so the complimentary car service took us to our brunch destination. That was very nice and so much better than a cab ride. Also, there is a Trader Joe's across the street where you can get some wine & beer,water, and snacks, rather than using the very expensive mini bar in your room. Staff: The concierges, doormen, front staff, and housekeeping were all extremely nice, helpful, and professional. We were greeted at our arrival by wishing us a Happy Anniversary. The evening of celebrating our anniversary they even had complimentary desert waiting for us in our room! It was something small but so very thoughtful and made us happy. The Rooms: We spent a good portion of time in our room for some pre-dinner drinks and TV watching in the morning. We never felt confined. We just had the basic King Room. The room is spacious and the beds are super comfortable. Even the bathroom had plenty of room to get ready and spread all my stuff out. The rooms are cleaned twice a day(turn down service at night, with a treat). It was so nice to come back after a night out, and have the room clean again. We also went to the gym daily, which was very clean and more than enough machines. Fresh water, towels, and even oranges were available for your workout.

If you answered YES to any of the above, then The James is the place for you. This past weekend I spent my 23rd birthday in Chicago. After scouring the 'net for hotel deals (for some reason people avoid traveling to areas where it snows in the winter--being from Texas, I relish it), I came across The James at $139/night through http://Travelzoo.com. Alone this would be a total steal (rooms generally run ~$250/night), and ON TOP of that a $100 food/beverage voucher was included for use at either David Burke's Primehouse, their in-house bar/lounge JBar, or In-Room Dining (more on that later). A separate spiel must be made for their concierge service/staff. A week or so before arriving I had e-mail correspondence with Daisy (such a pleasure to communicate with), to have ""The Anniversary"" amenity (a bottle of champagne along with these delicious bite-size brownie morsels topped with raspberries) awaiting my guest and I in our room before arrival. However, when we arrived--the amenity was not in our room. Not a big deal, I called down and they had someone send it up in under 5 minutes. But, the little card to accompany the surprise was not included. Again, no big deal. Thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the next day, my actual birthday. My guest and I hit the town for the majority of the day, returning early evening. Upon entry, I notice the card from yesterday WITH a plate of cookies (how thoughtful, I say to myself). THEN, I turn the corner to find a plate of birthday cupcakes with my OWN card signed by the entire concierge staff? Yes indeed, the sweetness overrunneth. FINALLY, as my guest and I sit down to enjoy piping hot Giordano's (the best in the city)--there's a knock at the door. It's Mirna the head concierge to apologize for forgetting the card yesterday and for the delayed delivery of the champagne with a tray of breadsticks and ice-cold beer !!! How did they know this would be the perfect addition to our meal?!? I have no idea, I just know I love them for it. Other Pros: Kiehl's bath products. Luxurious. Nightly turn-down service. Stayed two nights, two different cookies on my pillow. Room Service. See below After spending a few bucks at JBar before hitting the town the night before, we still had the majority of our food/beverage voucher to use the next morning before checkout. We. Went. Crazy. James Omelette for me (tri-tip steak, mushrooms, truffle oil, asiago cheese), Belgian Waffle for my guest. Hashbrowns, ham, juice, milk, & coffee to share. In a word? Delicious. Best room service I've ever eaten. They serve 24-hours a day too, including an enticing ""late-night"" menu which I'm surprised my guest and I didn't take advantage of--I think we passed out on the 300-thread count sheets before we picked up the phone. Cons? That I had to leave. You'll be seeing me again soon, James. Thanks for everything, you were the perfect start to a new birth year.";5;1;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

If he were a person, I'd imagine The James to kill in a suit, and dazzle just as well wearing nothing at all. Not to out-do you, but rather to elevate you. That's The James. You. Elevated. And from the start too. No coyness, no incessant wishing and hoping and waiting. He's straightforward. From the time you make reservations, concessions are made, no details are spared. It's courtship from the get-go. I'm still considered new to the city, having moved back only in October 2008. So I get to do all the touristy things and do them with glee. It's true. No sighing or eye-rolling here. I relish it all and challenge stereotypes. For my husband's birthday this year, everything seemed trite. He has enough Ben Sherman to start a boutique (though I did get him a wonderful black nylon jacket: http://tinyurl.com/qnc73p.

I didn't know her name then, but we're emailing now. Trying to set up a lunch date too. She wants to volunteer with us. No, I don't need any more friends, but this is just how it is at The James. You fall in love with everyone. She got to know me, understood being a local but wanting to experience this great city like you just flew in for the night. And she treated us right. The James doesn't have to do much to impress, but it works as hard as it would if it were a Howard Johnson. Of course, the lobby dazzles and yes, the dog biscuits and bowl of water out front is charming but everyone is so damn nice. Ready, willing and able to do anything. Our room was crisp and modern and homey all at once. Again, the perfect boyfriend knew you were coming. Six mini-cupcakes were waiting on a tray with a note encouraging a call if we were wanton for more. The bed was tucked tight and taut, as if you'd be the first to bounce on the mattress. It said just enough about him, but not enough that the mystery wouldn't last for years. And the furniture and art work were West Elm. . . elevated.

It has almost all the machines/equipment that you would need or could think of. It's clean and well-maintained. There are jars of ice-cold fruit-infused water with to keep you hydrated, and they get replenished frequently. They even provide you with wrapped earphones in case you forget to bring yours. Now, THAT is ATD. Instead of the traditional folio for your card keys, they have a mock-leather card wallet which includes a card-size street map. Very cute. ATD again. The room was clean, so very clean--spotless and odor-less. It's sort of ATD. I love that they don't have any bed spreads. They are gross and I hate them. Yay, I could just dive right into the bed without pulling it off first. Now, for the nitpicking items: I would've liked that the cute little ""dining nook"" (as they called it) would have some lighting in there for laptop or reading activities. Concierge, eh, that, we could live without. We felt that he was more about pushing his list onto us, rather than listening to us the sort of activities we'd love to do. Tips: We asked for higher floors and I was glad. We didn't have a view of the mile or downtown but it was bright and open. There were TONS of alcohol in the room; it was definitely a mega bar.

What I didn't like about the hotel was made up for in the impeccable service of this boutique hotel. Decor: I'm not a fan of the red.  It SCREAMS tacky.  It's the type of place with hip electronic music playing in the background and then you see a group of 30-40 year old bachelors with ripped designer jeans, half unbuttoned shirts, man jewelry and enough cologne to start a fire (when they light their cigarette). I guess a little red is okay, but to put a large patent pleather red chaise lounge in a room with four white walls is just wrong. What were you thinking??? The bed was very nice.  Very large and plush with soft sheets and down comforter.  Perfect for lounging around or having a lazy Sunday morning.  I liked the large wooden bench for setting your luggage and the nook for reading, working or eating was very nice (but not that comfortable).   Bathroom is very large, but houses the closet (weird).  Shallow tub reminds me of my own apartment.   Service and amenities: Love the cookies for turn down service!  Also love the martini glasses, large assortment of full bottles of liquer in room (Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Johnny Walker Black and Petron) with martini shaker, and Kiehls bath products.  (I LOVE Kiehls!!).  Free wifi is always great too!

1361;8/19/2009;402EEAN7fwoEIg04LPahTg;ULK94n8lgBIG0_F1aIYhvQ;"Really enjoyed my stay at the James Hotel.  I don't usually stay at hip modern décor spots, but the beds were comfortable and the shower had a nice stream of hot water and the rooms were spacious enough and that's really what I care about.  I'd like to tell you about the cookies, but my roommate ate them all. It is right in the heart of tourist stuff, which might not be hip, but I was a tourist so it worked out for me.   Was able to walk to one of the many walking tours that Frommers has on their website.  Right there, did you read that, that was probably the most important part of the review.  Whenever you visit a city, check out Frommers' walking tours (or some similar travel site, most of 'em have them).  They're great.  And if you stay at the James, they don't charge you to use the business center, so if you go to Chicago and stay at the James, you don't even have to do any preplanning to arrive, unless you plan on doing the architecture boat tour, which sells out. Anyhoo, my only complaint is that the elevators are slow.  Too many floors and too many people.  Time to get one of those fancy elevators where you tell the elevator which floor you're going to before you enter into the elevator. I've only been on 2 of those types of elevators and now that I've been on them, I think any new building is flawed if they don't have them.  I'm getting tired of stopping at every floor, that I'll either stay on the lower floors or will act like the woman on the southwest commercial and hit the door close button as people approach. That's not actually true, but I've felt like doing that. The most important thing to know though is that the most important celebrity to Yelp fans stayed here.  Yes, I ran into Fabio in the lobby of the hotel.  Yes the same Fabio who sadly was stuck working with Michael Chiarello. If you're not a fan of Fabio than you're probably should not be reading yelp. And that is the most rambling review I've ever posted.  Time to quit.";4;4;4;6;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Though we did not eat at the Primehouse restaurant, we did grab a soda in the bar and were impressed by the beautiful decor.  In addition, on our first late night out on the town, we found our way to their semi-hidden bar and lounge that served up custom cocktails in a dimly lit, skillfully soundtracked venue. Our room was just as stellar as the hotel amenities.  For starters, it was very spacious, especially for a city-based hotel.  The decor was sleek and minimalistic with the majority of the furnishings being white.  The room came equipped with a large flat-screen TV, a cozy reading nook, mini bar snacks, and a complete bar set with full-sized liquor bottles.  The bathroom was oddly equipped with a sliding door, the handle of which happened to fall off into my friend's arms on day one.  Regardless, the space was extremely large and offered Kiehl's products, as well as a convenient closet for storing personal toiletries.   Though I have loved the majority of my hotel stays in Chicago, The James had surpassed all of my previous experiences, both in the Windy City and abroad.  The flawless service, spotless room, comprehensive amenities, and beneficial location made this hotel a complete package for any traveler.";5;6;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

If the cleaning service is in the hallway talking you're going to be able to catch their entire conversation. - On the rear (south) facing rooms,  you might be awoken from slumber for 1 HOUR of trash removal. They seem to queue up dumpsters (about 20) in the alley behind the hotel. The trash day seems to be monday. - For a business hotel the Wifi is horrible.

I hate capitalize, but this seems outrageous for such a well rated, expensive hotel. - Clogged showers. My shower wouldn't drain properly... they sent a repairman up who promptly removed a large wad of hair from the drain. The service was great, but I feel that this is something that should be tested between occupants.

PENTHOUSE -  I stayed here with my girlfriends the Friday night before the wedding, they allowed us to check in very early and we transported all of my stuff there at that time, we had just come from having a mani/pedi party at a salon by my house and so we relaxed and watched TV and hung out. All of us girls got ready in the HUGEmarble bathroom for the rehearsal dinner. The room was wired for an ipod and had surround sound speakers in every room so we blasted music and proceeded to drink champagne. I highly recommend booking this room even if you are not holding your wedding at The James, it had a separate living room, dining room and bedroom, the bathroom was HUGE and I never once felt cramped with all my girls, mothers, etc in there. This was where we all got ready the day of and where my husband and I stayed after the wedding, they allowed us a 4:00pm check out on Sunday. CEREMONY: We held our Ceremony at The James in a Chevron round (I think that is what they call it) basically it was a semi circle around the chuppah. We loved it because all of our guests were right up close to us. The James's lighting was great and included in the price so I think that was a added benefit. FOOD/RECEPTION: This was one of the main reasons we booked The James Hotel. My Husband wanted David Burke to cater the meal. We had Lobster bisque with a crab roll to start, then salad, then an option of Chicken or a HUGE filet mignon, then we had wedding cake and their famous Cheesecake Lollipops for the table. It was amazing. The cocktail hour appetizers were amazing and people are still raving about the food. It is not a typical wedding meal it is treated and served like a fine dining experience. The only down side to that is that our dinning portion of the evening lasted almost 2 hours and cut into dancing. Once we realized how long it was taking we asked for the service to be sped up and they did. A++ for the food. This is not hit or miss, it is a sure thing. AFTER PARTY/THE JAMES CLUB: We had mini kobe beef cheeseburgers and truffle fries brought into the James Club which is a room off the Great room with a pool table, flat screens, and a bar. We also paid for an hour or two of extra open bar for our guests. We hooked up an ipod and were good to go. This was a great idea and everyone loved it.

The rooms were a pretty good size, but despite being on the 9th floor, there was a lot of exterior noise. The only complaint about the room is that is really isn't designed to be shared (especially by 2 women): the bathroom is long and narrow with limited counter space and no lighting or outlets by the full-length mirror and no mirror at all in the bedroom, which makes concurrent getting ready very difficult. They have a nightly turn-down service and give you a little treat from the restaurant downstairs (e.g. a small cookie), which is a nice touch. Valet parking is very expensive ($48/day), but it does give you in & out privileges. The concierge was very helpful when we asked for bar/club recommendations and gave us front-of-the-line/no cover passes for our entire group to some near-by trendy places (think the cover at one of those places was actually like $20, so definitely worth asking for!).";4;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1389;10/22/2009;sN8xuXa8Bn7T6ZIfTk3aFw;M13W3naAvdQH_KWoSgwL_A;"I have to agree with a few posters here: I can't imagine ever staying at another hotel in Chicago after my stay at to The James. Here, let me give you an example that sums up pretty well the kind of service you're going to get: after checking in at the front desk, my girlfriend and I made our way to the 9th floor (oh yeah, we got upgraded for taking a room on the ""smoking floor,"" even though you would never have known someone smoked in our room). We passed our floor's housekeeping lady, who greeted us with a massive smile and a sweet hello. We get to our door, but our room keys don't seem to be taking in the card slot. I try one or two more times, and then the housekeeping lady (let's just call her Maggie, for no reason whatsoever) comes over to see what's up. We tell her our card isn't working and she replies, ""Hold on, I'll get someone."" She then proceeds to SPRINT DOWN THE HALLWAY to get help. Within 30 seconds, there are two James employees helping us, and we're in. After seeing Maggie sprint down that hallway, I knew this was going to be better than any hotel I'd ever stayed in... and it was, by miles. The rooms were so clean, I was shocked. It looked brand new, and far cleaner than my own home. I can almost guarantee you no one had ever smoked in there; I've stayed in smoking rooms before, and there's usually at least ONE burn, either in the carpet, the couch, the bed, the windowsill, on the bathtub. Nothing. Our bed was massive, comfy and spotless, with crisp white sheets and the most comfortable pillow top mattress I've ever slept on. The bathrooms? Spotless. Big, thick towels. Warm, breathable robes. Kiehls bath products (never thought I'd care, but this stuff is gooood) refilled whenever needed. Great water pressure for the shower, too. The lights? All dimmable, save for the lamp in your room's breakfast nook. Oh yeah, free wireless Internet. A fully stocked bar, including a mini fridge (we bought our own beverages across the street at Trader Joe's). What else? How about The Primehouse, attached in the lobby (it's also the main source for room service... try the steak omelet, delivered with a New York Times and a pot of incredible Primehouse coffee, right to your door in the morning!). Print out your boarding passes in the little office center in the lobby. Get some great tips from the concierge, or visit the James' site for their restaurant, shopping and other recommendations. I heard about Graham Elliot from their site and it wound up being one of the best meals of my life! Not one time during our entire stay did housekeeping accidentally walk in, or even knock to see if they could come in and clean. Nope, we'd just go out for a stroll or a quick brunch and by the time we returned, Maggie had already worked her magic. Oh, and if you leave for a few hours in the evening, expect to come home with your bed turned down, your robe laying out for you, with a couple of complimentary cookies from the Primehouse as a bedtime snack. The ginger snaps are especially yummy. James hotel, you've ruined me for my own home. Do you have a monthly rate?";5;7;5;5;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

It's no wonder it has a five-star rating: incomparable customer service; friendly, professional staff; great gym; beautiful, well appointed rooms; Kiehl's products; and David Burke's Primehouse (their asiago popovers are to die for). The location is fantastic as well. We were upgraded to a suite at check-in (thanks, Marco, you're the best!), which was the perfect start to our six-day vacation in Chicago. There was no view to speak of (when we looked out our windows we saw the back of the hotel), but it didn't really matter since we didn't stay in much. It was great having an extra sitting area (with TV) to unwind in after a long day of walking around and taking in this awesome city. I would love to stay here again.";5;2;2;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

I can't even remember his name because it was like a bad dream. First, there was no congrats! That is just a basic greeting. Also, we were planning a wedding with a very large budget, but he was making us feel like he was doing us a favor. He just seemed liked a miserable person who was far from helpful and also suggested we move our wedding day to a Sunday when we clearly said we wanted a Sat. night wedding. I am a low key bride and this was the first time I could see how people go insane planning. There are many great hotels in the city for weddings..go somewhere else!";1;2;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1394;5/23/2007;F7o19Xwgh-Qtg-8zgkFNiw;BVdozpYiykmQtwk5WK4QsQ;"Overrated, overhyped hotel.  The hotel bar is small, spartan.  The hallways have dark brown carpet that looks really old, dirty and shabby, and I think this is supposed to be a new hotel??  The halls are dark, narrow and have low ceilings.  The elevator is oldish and small, which kinda tells you the real age of the building.   The rooms are small, so small that there's a sliding door between the room and the bathroom because -- the room is too small to have a regular door!  The funny thing is that bathroom door has a porthole of a window, reminding you that your room isn't much bigger than a room on a cruiseship.  (Probably a subconscious slip on the designer's part.)  And that sliding door falls off its rails -- cheap!  Only one person can fit in the bathroom.  You step in and are immediately in front of the mirror, toilet and shower, with no room to move about!  The toilet was cheap quality -- I remember something breaking but easily fixable by me, but I forget, as this review is four months after my trip. Yes, there's a flat screen, and people like to mention that.  Really?  So what!  There's a funky chair and a funky table that looks like a tree stump.  For a while I thought that tree stump was a stool and had an argument with a friend as to what it was -- table or stool.  I guess it can be both, but officially, it's a table.  You know why I thought it was a stool?  Because there's not enough places to sit! There's no computer chair and no table.  So, you're going to put your laptop on that funky stump.  And who wants to crouch over and read their email? Sure, the bed linens look fluffy, but I stayed at the holiday inn express up in portland, and they had the same fluffy white linen/comforter!  Anyhow, the room is dark because of the brown carpet, and the walls are bare, except for black/white photographs, which makes the room look colder and more depressing.  Because as you look up at the walls and ceiling, you can tell this was probably once something I would describe as a residency hotel.  Or just a barebones, nothing special apartment I had in college.   So, I have no idea why this hotel is featured in magazines at all!  I guess people are easily fooled into staying because of how they showcase their suites.  Chicago's expensive, even in winter -- go figure, so figuring that in and the hotel's location, I'd pay no more than $130.  But for that price, I'd still feel ripped off!  I wouldn't bother with this hotel at all -- it's both cold feeling and shabby/dreary -- like drunks probably died in here 70 years ago.

I know I might be on my own, but hear me out-- the room was really tiny, like NYC tiny, and it smelled like cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. Now let's start there--before I opened the door. I went to the front desk and checked in, went up stairs to my room, which was not the room number they told me, it was a converted conference room of some sort that they didn't even bother to change the name to a number. I proceeded to call the front desk and let them know that my room did not exist, which is when they finally told me it was actually called ""study number 1"". Went to put my key card in and did not work, so I tried a few other times before I finally gave up and called the front desk again. They told me to try again in a couple of minutes and if it didn't work, to go downstairs and get a new card. Of course, I had to go and get a new card. So I go downstairs and wait in what seems like the longest line (which I know wasn't their fault but I was just annoyed) then got a new card and headed back upstairs. Guess what? It DOESN'T WORK... AGAIN! I call the front desk again and get an answer by an equally annoyed front desk person, who tells me that I must be doing something wrong because the room key works. How rude! Finally, a very nice employee comes in and tries to use my key, which does not work (thankyouverymuch front desk girl). He got it opened with his key and had to get me a copy similar to his key for the remainder of my stay. That same night I was getting ready for an event and had my itunes on while chatting with a co-worker, when I was interrupted by the concierge because ""people were complaining about the noise level""--ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What kind of dorm room/church retreat twilight zone was I in? I turned it off... I will give this place 3 stars only because of their location--it's in the middle of where everyone wants to be and all the shopping. Maybe next time James Hotel.";3;1;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1399;3/17/2011;Qgz4zb6O4TG8i97EtJT-fw;4EgkJZJJboI_fssQ8h69Ug;"I stayed at The James for 4 nights - 2 nights work and 2 nights play! This was the perfect place to stay. The first night I went to the bar for a bite and a drink. The bartender was very friendly and even made me a concotion based on my likings. I got the Kobe Corndogs which were very good. You can tell that they use quality ingredients. The next morning I realized that I needed to make colored copies on my way since I had to make some changes to my presentation. Of course I am running late too, so the manager helped me out and printed out everything I needed. He went the extra mile and was really nice and quick. During our stay, we also happened to wander into J Bar on Friday and Saturday night. This lounge was small, but a perfect size for the amount of people they accomodate on a normal day. The drinks were a bit pricey but stout - so well worth it. And the music was ideal for a lounge - all the latest hits. We also ordered in breakfast one morning. The entree was huge, filling, and tasty - quality ingredients once again. Room service usually lets me down, but not  at The James! The rooms were always clean. My boyfriend and I were a mess and the maid always seemed to be able to put things away where they belonged. My sister, who was staying next door thinks she cleaned up too much and that it was weird. But being there for 4 days... I appreciated it! The beds were comfortable, mini bar well stocked, and Kiehl's products!!! Turn down service every night with little mini cookies. The only downfall about this place is the street noise, but the hotel isn't to blame. I give them 5 stars for a perfect hotel experience 4 days in a row.";5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1400;4/29/2009;6HfIWvZHbVoV2tOAUdoorg;Zq_1sUXh5EcAkUPCHaQehg;"I've been meaning to review The James for almost a year now. My husband  and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We, being designers, wanted to stay in a modern hotel. After doing a little online research, I found The James and it looked like a place that we would love! OMG, The James was heaven! We stayed in the penthouse. It has beautiful walnut furniture, walls and floors. The bathroom is all marble. I love the combination of walnut and marble. It's full of designer furniture, clean lines, flush closets, pocket doors and beautiful materials. The concierge knew that it was our wedding night, so when we walked in, completely exhausted after a long, but wonderful day, there was some cool lounge music playing lightly throughout the room and there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a nice little tray of cookies. We proceeded to enjoy our champagne while enjoying the wonderful view of the city. And then, like the design nerds we are, we completely examined all the well-designed features of every nook and cranny of that room. The interior design is really great. I want my condo to look exactly like that someday. And I want to have my iPod streaming music through every room! Even their music selection was totally us. The bathroom was awesome: big, clean shower, huge, marble bathtub complete with an LCD TV. They have Kiehl's bath products. It was all just so beautiful! We also ordered room service. We filled out a little card and hung it on our door before we went to bed. And at our requested time, they delivered our breakfast and we ate it at the dining room table while, once again, enjoying the amazing view of the city. Check out time wasn't until 2:00 so we milked that one! We wanted to stay there as long as possible! I'd like to move in :)";5;1;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1401;3/1/2010;nNjUaPrqZeTJuau1VN8WSw;G87zEbu0oPpYzmn4LUMC3g;"There are just a couple of things that hold me back from giving the full five stars. One is that many of the rooms are interior-facing and have absolutely no view [except into other rooms, which may or may not be OK depending on who is occupying them]. The other is the simple fact that the bar for hotels in Chicago is so high, and this place isn't quite as slick as the Peninsula or Four Seasons. That said, it also doesn't cost nearly what those places do, so the value for price is terrific. I'd recommend registering your e-mail with them on-line. I got a great e-mail offer for $129/night with a $50 food-and-beverage credit that was a wonderful bargain. The lobby is long and narrow, with a small lounge to the left just outside David Burke's Primehouse. That restaurant offers amazing lunch bargains, so it's certainly worth checking out midday. Their side of steamed asparagus with shallots is amazing. My great rate was actually for a studio suite--not just the standard room. When I first walked in the room, I wasn't sure about it, but after hanging out a few minutes, I really got to like the layout. The sleeping area is very small, far away from the door. It's really kind of a nook, with just the bed and two wall-mounted shelves that serve as bedside tables. There's also a flat-screen TV there. Most of the space in the studio suites is devoted to living area, which, when you think about it, is really where you want your space. There's also a huge bar with full bottles [not minis] of several liquors and a well-stocked fridge. There's plenty of shelf and counter space included with the bar, as well as an iPod-ready stereo. There's lots of glassware, but only martini glasses and highballs. No wine glasses or swizzle sticks. Oh, and ice is provided by room service. I'm on a campaign to get hotels to put ice machines on each floor. No one wants to have to call and wait. The room decor has a mid-century feel, with low-slung, clean-lined furniture. The color scheme is mostly brown and off-white, with big splashes of red for accent. Most of the lighting is on dimmers, so you can adjust it to your mood. All in all, it's a pretty attractive room. The bathroom is narrow with a tub/shower combo, but plenty of counter space. It's been renovated since it was the Lenox Suites, but there's a little wear and tear showing, such as chips in the bathtub molding and an unraveling robe. This was a quick trip, so I didn't get to check out the spa, gym, or JBar. Next time. Service is of the friendly and efficient type, rather than the formal and polished as at some of the highest-end places in town. Had no issues with getting what I needed, though. Room service breakfast was prompt, tasty, exactly as ordered, and in large portion. Others have commented about problems with the elevators, but I had no long waits at all. They are smallish, though. Location is perfect, two blocks from the Grand Red Line stop, one block from the Mag Mile, across the street from a Trader Joe's, and two blocks from a P. F. Chang's and a Joe's Seafood if you want chain food. If you're a hotel freak like me and want to check out some others, you're in pretty easy walking distance from a huge number worth looking at--Trump, Conrad, Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Drake. The Coq d'Or at the Drake is the perfect old-school hotel bar. They started serving ten minutes after Prohibition was repealed and the bartenders all look like they've been there since that day. If price is no object and you must have the best in Chicago, check out the Peninsula. If you're looking for the point where price and quality cross on the grid, look no further than the James.";4;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1418;7/26/2012;4AX9;EqKrQPQpkwZhgHRXDG1lkg;"There were pros and cons.   Pros: Location couldn't be better.  We stayed at the lakefront location last year and even though that hotel was in better shape and the stay was an overall better experience, we preferred the centralized location of this hotel.   Check in was efficient if not overly friendly. Room was up to date, clean, and boasts very comfortable beds.   Breakfast was well cooked and of good quality, although often a little on the chilly side. Reception drinks were well-made and the line moved quickly.  Excellent snacks. The attached restaurant (not run by Hilton) was *wonderful*. Cons: (Small complaint) No automatic upgrade for Diamond members.  I didn't bother to ask because this was a weekend point redemption and I was pretty sure they were sold out by that point. It's nice to be recognized for loyalty. Breakfast seemed incredibly understaffed.  Tables sat waiting to be bussed for 30 minutes or more.  People were wandering around with trays looking for places to sit while 1/3 of the tables were piled with garbage and dishes. The floors were sticky and dirty.  The service area was sticky with spilled food and sported balled up napkins and discarded cups. Food was chilly even as it came out of the back because I'm guessing they had to make it way ahead of time.  Breakfast was regular-weekend crowded, not line-snaking around the atrium crowded, so I can't imagine why the cooks and bussers seemed to be so overworked.  Maybe everyone called in sick that day? Price was bad.  Granted we came for a weekend in the middle of summer, but the price on this hotel for that weekend was the same or more than Conrad, the Drake, or the Wit.  I opted instead for a rewards redemption, but I had to bust out the same number of points I would have for anything in Hilton's luxury line.  So my expectations were enhanced and as a result, I was less than impressed. I love the Embassy Suites chain in general and as we travel and move around a lot, I've stayed at 30-40 different ES properties over the past 15 years or so.  This one was middle of the road.  The price was exhorbitant in comparison.  If you are staying with kids and you can snag a price of say, $179 or less, then give this place a shot.  But if you are trying to get away as a couple, there are better choices.  Much better.  Please don't EVER pay the $349+ dollars they wanted for last weekend.";3;2;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

The usual culprit of rude and obnoxious staff? The barging in of some staff members this morning while I was in the shower, to ""update my TV,"" despite the privacy lock being on. (The prelude to this incident was yesterday, when the maid continually knocked on my door while the do not disturb hanger was on the knob, and again the privacy lock was on, to interrupt a much needed nap, to ask me if I wanted a bag of ice). How about the extremely loud atmosphere, which includes the loud waterfall in the lobby? The fact that you can't walk to the elevator without a bloody housekeeping cart in the way? My room had a lovely view of the parking garage, which isn't horrible, since it IS Chicago and is surrounded by structures, but I was told the hotel was fully booked, and no other room was open by the extremely helpful and competent clerk. Come to find out that the hotel was almost completely open and the night manager didn't know why the clerk earlier had told me they were booked. This hotel has just been an awful experience from the get go. I have stayed at Embassy Suites Lakefront once or twice, and it was okay, but this one is not impressive at all. I would avoid this one. Stay at a Marriott hotel instead! This is pretty much just a glorified Motel 6.";1;2;1;2;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

It's also got a pool and hot tub that I used, as well as a free business center, which made me happy for when I was checking in for my return flight. The OK - The layout of the atrium is a bit confusing. Only one staircase down leads to the first floor? Weird.  And of course, since it's downtown, it is ever so difficult to find reasonable parking. The bad - the layout of the kitchen and dining area needs major major rework. Supremely confusing. So am I supposed to simply bypass teh ENORMOUS LINE of tourists if I don't want a omelette? Or am I supposed to suffer through 30 minutes of wiating for just simple french toast?  And the capacity isn't as big.  And the employees showed their frustrations ... I would be as crass and rude as their employees during breakfast if I had to get my butt out of bed super early just to have thousands of people go through a terribly laid out place. And about that room ... the thermostat was either broken or the place couldn't heat up well.  I had to set it to 80 deg just to get it a normal temperature (a sensor I have in my phone put the room at 70 when the thermostat said 80). Also, paid wifi? WTF? What is this, 2004? Also, what is happening to parents in this country? Control your idiot children and out of control tweens please!   Finally, the bathroom needed a little cleaning around the edges. Nothing super terrible but still, after seeing the air vent directly above the showerhead with grime on it, I had to clean it myself just so I wouldn't be bothered by it. Protip: if you're going to have free awesome breakfast, expect traffic! Major rework is needed to keep up with capacity and how utterly confusing it all was. Would I recommend it? Of course.  Just get up at 6:30 for breakfast and you're set and you bypass the long line of tourists also there, and bypass the majority of the complaints I have.  You also can't beat the price for the location.";3;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

The bell service was supposed to deliver some important items to co-workers who were staying at the hotel... they didn't get them on time, but I was still charged the $2.50 to-room delivery charge. *sigh* Internet - both wired and wireless - is $12.95 a day!

My room key cards would not stay activated.  They demagnetized the minute I put the card in the purse.  So, every time I came back from leaving my room, I had to call security to let me back in.  That was getting old really quick!  They suggested not putting the card in my purse, so I put it in my pant pocket... same issue.  I guess I'm supposed to carry the card around like an Olympic torch? Breakfast was ridiculously expensive!!

The towels were not crunchy or hard as hotel towels can so easily be. The view from the 14th floor was great and I enjoyed waking up to the view of a bustling downtown sprawl, without the noise. The luggage check and valet staff were great - very efficient and courteous. The downside to the Sheraton is that beyond coffee in your room, NOTHING is included in the $259/night price tag. That's one expensive bed, pillow, and morning coffee. You want Internet? That'll be $12.99/day. You have a third party payer who paid your stay in full? Be prepared to remind them of that, because they will ask for your credit card. You attend a conference? Be prepared for burnt coffee and stale bagels. I wouldn't voluntarily stay at the Sheraton again...unless my company gave me no choice. :-\";3;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

It is in prime location because you can walk to Michigan Ave for shopping or any restaurant that you want to. The layout of the hotel and cleanliness is great as well. The rooms of this hotel are small, even if you get a queen-bed room. The main reason I was unhappy with this hotel was because of the staff. From the door-man outside to the reception desk inside, they are not kind or professional. They all seem like they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there. My friend left my shoes that I needed for the evening at the front desk with my name and room number. When I sent my wife to ask them for the shoes, the man working there was very rude and didn't even listen to what she was asking for. He said there was nothing there. When I went later and spoke with another person, my shoes were there the whole time. Later, when I asked the front desk for a cab, they told me I would have to call-in for a cab or wait for one outside. I decided to walk outside and find a cab myself. When I finally flagged one down and asked it to pull into the hotel driveway, the bell-man (door-man) was so rude to me and treated me (31 yr old male) like a 10 year old child telling me that it was his job and I should have told him. Then why did the staff inside tell me I would have to get one myself if there was a bell-man outside for that job? After treating me like a child, he went on to embarrass me in front of my friends stating that he should get me a uniform so I could work there with him since I'm more pro-active than he is. WTH?! Does anyone treat guests that way? If this is how you want to be treated by staff at a renowned hotel chain, then this is the place for you. No professionalism, no courtesy, no spacious rooms.

Must have been all those martinis you were pouring for me!) I am here so often- that even the banquet help recognize me and say ""Hi"" and ""Welcome back"" when they see me. The Sheraton is located in a great spot- close to anything you want to do in Chicago and the concierge is always willing to toss out a new idea or two (especially helpful when all your global friends keep wanting to go get ""Chicago pizza"" or go to ""Navy Pier"" which, while great, are really not what I want to show people about our fine city! Valet parking is a breeze- just know that you need to take the elevator by the front doors down to the parking garage to pick up your car. It will not be brought around to the front of the hotel.

Fifth, as the girls and I were getting ready to check out, we get a knock on the door from housekeeping asking us if she could come in to check our mini-fridge to see if we had taken anything.  Um...no.  That's unprofessional.  Come back when we've checked out.  While I'm on the topic of the mini-fridge, let me just say that it's waaayyyy too stocked with stuff.  If you had gone out to eat and brought some leftovers (like we did), you'd have NO room to put it in the fridge to keep it fresh.  Nevermind the fact that I could've taken some stuff out.  There should've been at least SOME room in the fridge for stuff not already in there.   Sixth, the internet isn't free unless you go to the 33rd floor.  This last one is just an extra complaint to add to the others that made the Sheraton less than an ideal place for me to stay.  I mean, for all that we're paying, we could've gotten more amenities included and better service.  I just didn't have the best time there, so I think the next time I'm in town and need to stay in a hotel, I'm gonna stay somewhere else.";1;2;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The views of the river, lake, and city are outstanding if you get a city view that includes all.   Having traveled for years nearly 100% of the time earlier in my career, and staying downtown quite a bit, I think I have stayed at most of the great places in Chicago and in most big cities that I have been to. So I think I have seen it nearly all, both good and bad. This place is the most consistent that I have stayed at in Chicago outside of the Union League Club and the team here always exceeds my expectations, bar none. Traveling with the family?  I really recommend their mini-suites that are along the river, with an adjoining room for the kids.  Nice large room with lots of space to unwind, and with the adjoining room, you end up with two full bathrooms, three TV's, 3 phones, and 2 entry ways for everyone to fight over, plus a very large dining table if your order in, or need some extra space beyond the two desk areas to do work or have the kids play games. They really have kept the place up and it is very nicely appointed.  As far as the earlier comments about knobs or dials instead of digital readouts, these don't bother me.  I would hate for them to upgrade the units just to get more advanced readout displays, and our space was really well ventilated and comfortable. Pool and workout space is great, very clean, and well monitored. If you arrive early and your room is not available, or if you need a place to hang after checkout, I really recommend the club or concierge room on the 33rd floor.   Great complimentary snacks (great hors'vrs in the evening), fruit, coffee, tea, and bottled water, plus on the second level, great business center with computers for your use. Also, nice entertainment area for watching tv and relaxing.  My real favorite is the leather massage chair.  Really a nice perk! Oh, and if you are a starwood member (http://spg.com) you get express check in and check out, and you can use your points to get free rooms or discounted rooms that are an absolute steal. Be nice, and depending on availability, they will upgrade you for free.  They are really happy to do it, and you'll be happy too!";5;1;1;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The gym fee is not included in the price of your hotel stay, which is a pretty big turn off for us.  Luckily, the weather was nice enough for a run outdoors and that run was much more enjoyable and memorable than a hotel treadmill could ever be.  So if you keep up with your workouts while on the road, consider the additional gym fee.

Now it's not to say that they don't have ANY flaws.  With the kind of price they charge their guests every night, high-speed wireless internet should be FREE.   But that's a minor concern.  After all, don't we all want to be AWAY from all the craziness of emails and things-to-do's when we're on vacation??";5;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

In my room alone: the door lock did not work. The armoire was probably unbalanced because the door and all the drawers would open by themselves. If I got up at night, this trap blocked the path to the bathroom and could have nailed me if I'd not been alert. Some of the staff demand tips. The bellhop held firm to my bags until I took out money for a tip (he hadn't helped with the bags, I brought them to him, and then retrieved them on my own when no help was available). The doorman passed me over twice until I took out cash for a tip so I could get a cab. Haven't had people this agressive for tips since I was in Bangkok Thailand where they live on tips alone. They charge for an internet connection, so I'm glad I brought my own hotspot. I was here for a convention. The escalator from the lobby was out for most of my stay, so we had quite a hike from one end of the hotel to the other and back, plus up and down multiple floors.

I love the location of the hotel, it is in very close proximity to all the major attractions in Downtown Chicago such as Navy Pier, shopping, etc. When you drive up to this hotel and even when you walk in the lobby, you get the feeling that this is going to be a fantastic hotel with the grand entrance and the beautiful lobby. However, in terms of the rooms itself, I was kinda dissapointed especially because it is a Sheraton Hotel. We got what I believe is a standard room on the 18th floor and even walking through the hallway to get to the room, all the doors look dated and worn down. When we arrived at our room, my travel companion commented on how the lock looked as if someone broke it to it before. The room itself was also looked pretty dated with some heavy wooden closet doors, older looking bathroom and dated decor. The chair I'm sitting on even creaks like crazy every time I move. Though I have to say the most annoying part is the heavy doors to the rooms that slam shut everytime someone walks in and out of their room on the floor, so loud that I'm woke up every time...boo! But the bed itself are ok, pretty comfy. In terms of the other facilities offered by the hotel, the fitness center is equipped with some very nice treadmills (with the tv built in) and a full set of weights available for arm workouts. The pool itself, although indoor and relatively small is a nice place to relax after a hard workout as well. Since both are located on the 7th floor, you get a beautiful view of the Lake when you sit on one of the chairs around the pool. Another nice feature is the sundeck where a few sun chairs are set up and where you can soak up some sun. Unfortunately the sauna was broken or else I'd love to have used that as well.

1513;5/7/2008;mPLsJ0iGBiP3Tep6ow0gbg;t_I1RMxZPO3JJtuklubUZA;"I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this: the Sheraton Chicago is the stingiest hotel I have ever encountered.  There are lots of hidden fees.  Let me count the ways in which you are charged and taxed for every small item. --there is a continental breakfast available on the 33rd floor.  However, it is only for ""club members"" though this is not made clear to you.  After you sit down with your coffee and bagel, you are given a scrip of paper to sign which states that you will be charged 19 bucks plus 18 percent tip for a continental breakfast.  WTF?  You would much be better served to go across the black to the NBC building, rather than this overpriced bagel shop. --The POOL costs money.  Huh?  a 300 dollar hotel room won't pay for your pool?  This is too cheap for my tastes.  Otherwise it costs 12 bucks a day or 20 bucks for your entire stay to dip in the the not-so-olympic sized pool.  Instead, I took a hot bath.  In my quickie tour I didn't see a spa or a hot tub either. --The restaurants are overpriced.  My girlfriend and I at the ""Chi Bar"" and the drinks were about 12 bucks for a Mojito.  I got a screwdriver with the house vodka for 10 bucks.  Huh?  The drinks at the top of the Hancock Tower, where at least the view is remarkable was only a dollar more per drink.  For a small glass of orange juice and smirnoff vodka 10 bucks just ain't right. --The hotel room itself was tiny tiny tiny.  Evidently our company footed the bill on the room, so we didn't care too much about the 300 dollar price tag, but the room was not very big at all. --the TV gives you about 24 channels.  Ok, whatever, but the annoying thing is that if you turn the tv off then turn it back on, the channel is switched to the continuous Sheraton informercial, which is a peeve. --Another small charge: starbucks coffee cups and a small coffee maker are on the desk next to the bed, far away from the mini bar.  However, these cups of coffee cost 3 bucks a piece.  Is ANYTHING included in the 300 dollar hotel tag?  What will Sheraton do in the future, charge us each time they clean the sheets?  My god. --Another thing: it is cheaper to take a taxis than the hotel shuttle.  Yup, they charge for that as well.  They want you so bad that they charge you 27 bucks each way to ride in a van with uncomfortable seats crowded with other suits.  The van concierge actually told me and my girlfriend to take a taxi, and not their own hotel service, and for that he did us a big favor. To recap: at Sheraton, everything has a price tag, and if you can waste money, then this place will gobble it up.  However, if you want a luxury hotel room, then don't go here.  Your 300 dollars will not give you anything more than a bed to sleep on. So basically, the experience that you get as a customer at this not fine establishment is that they are out to make the quick buck on you, not to provide you with comfort.  Hidden fees and charges are not cool, and a 300 dollar price tag needs to include more than a bed and sheets.  I have been to model 6's with more service.";1;2;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

It's in a great location on the Chicago River blocks away from Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, CTA stations, Grant Park, and much more. You walk in and are greeted to an impressive, expansive lobby. Heading upstairs, we arrived in a clean, updated hotel room. There was a HD LCD TV! On top of that, there was a great view down the Chicago River towards the new Trump Tower. The only complaint I had was the plumbing, which is the reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review. Upon using the bathroom, the sink wouldn't drain and the toilet was acting strange. But once we got the staff up there, everything went smoothly from there on. Back to the lobby. We were told upon check in about the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby. There are two of them. We were told that the Sheraton Chicago was one of five hotels to have them in the country. I can tell you, they're pretty much awesome, and I don't even like Microsoft. The interface is a little clunky, but it's pretty cool to listen to their catalog of music and discover a little bit about what to do in the city of Chicago on a touchscreen computer built into a coffee table! Be warned though, it wasn't until just before we left that I got to try one out. They're extremely popular. Moving on, there are five restaurants/bars in the hotel, including Shula's Steakhouse and the Java Bar, which serves Starbucks. Shula's has an excellent buffet. For $20, you can have an awesome selection of food, ranging from smoked salmon to bagels to deconstructed parfaits to pastries to pancakes to omelets and everything in between. The steakhouse has a great atmosphere too, although I never had lunch or dinner there. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful and took care of everything we needed. Overall, if you're looking for a great hotel to stay at in Chicago at a moderate price, the Sheraton is what you're looking for.";4;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

This is a huge convention hotel and if you like crowds or thongs of families and kids, or teenagers attending an event then this is your hotel.  It looks like they put ALL their money into the lobby and elevator banks on the main level. Look carefully at the doors on your floor, they are 2 shades of brown! Oh and the bathrooms have clearly seen better days. I would be upset if I spent $200 a night to stay here. The room (at least mine) had a very dark, masculine feel. They charge you $12.95 a day for the internet here and you cannot get a wireless signal so don't even think about it. New LG LCDs are in the room and a decent cable assortment made this stay tolerable. They did put out hot cider and fresh cookies twice while I stayed here which was a nice touch since it was about 10 degrees outside, but thats winter in Chicago. Everyone says this location is off the beaten path...it really isn't unless you are a typical lazy american but I could see how walking back at night could be troubling to some as its a bit empty.

The bright side is, service doesn't get much better.  There's nothing this hotel won't do to help make your stay more enjoyable.  From great restaurant recommendations to driving you in the Acura Experience.  (which btw, is very common among W Hotels). So it's really a toss up for me....the the prices the command, I really don't believe there's room for imperfection.  As a matter of fact, try ordering a bottle to the room, and you'll probably fall off your chair - $250 bottle, $3.50 delivery, $51 bottle service, and $26 tax....WTF!!!!   are you serious!!!??? As for location, there's a great lake view, you're right by Navy Pier, and you're about 3 blocks (long blocks though) from Michigan (Magnificent Mile).  So while I'd agree there isn't all that much within the immediate block of this hotel, there are many options if you walk a few blocks.

The bathroom also lacks a real door.  We had a sliding bamboo door and shutters. I shit you not!  There are wooden shutters in a wall separating the main room from the bathroom.

Oh, when I did get to my room, about 20 minutes into it, Jen called to inquire if I needed anything. I actually didn't get a chance to really enjoy the bar but it seems more of a scene at happy hour than at night, but that could have been because I was there on a Wednesday and Thursday. Still, as with all the Ws I've been to around the US, the bar and lounge were typically sleek and playful, sort of like something out of a Jonathan Adler catalog.

So for the price that we got it for, I should rate them 5 stars. However, if I had to pay $300 for this room, the same price at Swissotel, I would probably give it 2.5 or 3 stars. The design of the hotel is cool and contemporary (browns/lavendars/grays), very West Elm-ish. We asked for a room on a higher floor, which they accommodated, but the view was not of the lake or Navy Pier. Night view was nice because during the holidays, Chicago decorates streets with lights, but during the day, the view is of  other people's condos and parking lot. We had 1 window instead of 5. I was most impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and liquid facial soap from Bliss (famous brand for spa located in NY, Chicago and LA -- probably elsewhere too). Really liked the quality of shampoo and conditioner. But, we didn't get bar soap to wash hands (but they do have soap dish). I had to use facial liquid soap just to wash hands (slight inconvenience). No bathtub either (not that I wanted to take a bath or anything). Shower was nice, but Swissotel offered both. The bathroom shelf where Bliss products looked mildly dusty [ : \ ] The ""W"" experience was more about selling stuff. They had Bruce Mau book on spectators and a ""W"" book that sells brands and products. Cover was kind of cool (looks like fishnet), but book looked kind of old. I flipped through it anyways. I did like how they labelled the price for water ($6 for Fuji water). So if you are a hipster, this hotel might be for you, but I prefer to pay and extra $20 for Swissotel. This hotel experience was comparable to a knock-off of André Balazs' Standard Hotel chains, but not as hip.

The lobby is gorgeous, and has a relaxing atmosphere. Checking in was pretty easy. The woman at the front desk was very eager to answer any and all questions we had about our stay. Now for the bad. The room we were provided with was absolute junk. The door to the room would not shut unless two people applied their entire body weight to it. The same goes for the bathroom ""door."" It is made of some sort of mock-bamboo material, and ours just did not want to close, even when the two of us tried. At first glance, the bathroom itself looks very nice. However, it gets about one star from me, because there is no functionality to it what so ever. The ""bamboo"" shutters is by far the worst thing about the room as a whole. You have the ability to shut them, but that does not mask any sounds coming from the bathroom. I love my fiance, but not enough to listen to his every move while using the toilet. The bed sheets in this room were filthy. Stains of God knows what were all over the place when we attempted to take a nap before heading out on the town. That is when we had enough. We requested a different room at the front desk, and were given one with no hassle at all. The door to the new room was completely functional, as was the one to the bathroom. However, there were cracks in the ceiling and while we were sleeping, bits of plaster would fall on to our faces. The temperature of the room is almost impossible to get right, you are either freezing cold, or sweating through your clothes. The shower was horrible in both rooms. Very pretty looking, but when in use, it gets water all over the floor since there is only half of a ""door"" and no curtain. The knob on our shower was also broken, so it took about 15 minutes for us to turn it on. All in all, the W was beautiful on the outside, but for what you are paying, it is definitely not worth it.

I'm not a very demanding guest, so I don't make the staff jump through hoops and then complain about horrible service on here when I don't get my way. The location is great for the views, but not nessacerely for getting to public transportation. Cabs are always available, though if you have a car, expect to pay $50 a day for parking. The bar on the 30-something'ish floor is less to be desired. It's just a very dark room with a view over looking the city. This is Chicago! There are plenty of bars every where! I love this place!

Good:   Beds.  They are amazingly fantastic.  I haven't had that good of a night's sleep since.   Water.  The showers are awesome and the bath room pretty cool. TV.  Great HD tv with this hypnotic trace music set to soothing visuals when you first turn it on.

GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest.  Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside.  I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy.  Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in.  If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . .

The W seems to be an old, rundown hotel they took and tried to gussy up. My friends' room had scuff marks on the walls, cheap wood (or press board?) paneling nailed to one wall, and it was TINY. The bathrooms have a window, which is not only weird, but provide NO sound barrier. Pretty awkward, depending on who you're staying with. The shower heads are low and her husband almost wasn't able to fit under them! The bamboo blinds were also filthy. When you enter the room, you are greeted with a basket of goodies. Wow! Now, this helps to explain the $300ish for a crap room rates... or maybe not. We soon realized that next to this basket of ""goodies"" was a price list. An individual can of Pringles? $5! You can also buy 3 or 4 condoms for $12 and a ""Take me Away"" CD for $13. Wow. sexy, huh? Not really. Oh- and if you want anything that isn't in your room (towels, food, etc.) it's a $3.50 DELIVERY CHARGE and a 20% service fee. Wow. The 33rd floor (I believe it's called the Altitude Room?) is pretty nice, but the bathrooms have no main door. Again... awkward. The stones in the sink were pretty cool though, I have to admit.

I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room.  So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: ""We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!""  Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things.

As a side note - the vibe that I got from the lobby is very similar to that of the V Bar at Hotel Valencia, and the skankily dressed non-hotel guests and visitors remind me of San Jose's Santana Row's clientele: cougars on the prowl and 50-y.o dudes with 20-y.o golddigging arm candies.  Nothing beats the feel of home when you are a few thousand miles away. And I do think the attempt to put a ""W"" on anything and everything was a tad overdone.   But in all fairness, they did a good job transforming a dying and derelict Days Inn into a hip hangout joint. The cacophony stopped right there in the lobby.  I got the peace and quiet that I wanted in my room on level 20th, with an amazing view of the frosty Lake Michigan and Navy Pier.  The bed was comfortable (although the odd-looking soft black furry cube soon found its place on the floor), the toiletries are from the phenomenal Bliss Spa, and there was lots and lots of natural light.  I even like the window to the bathroom - although I don't know if I'd feel the same way if I wasn't traveling alone, since I'm not much of an exhibitionist. The service was consistently satisfactory.  Need a dental kit? Done - someone was already at the front door with an assortment of toothpaste / toothbrush / dental floss / mouthwash within 5 minutes.  Need a late check out? Done - 2PM.  Want more of those awesome Bliss toiletries (who doesn't love freebies)? Done - no questions asked.

Sometimes the hotel can be ""too mod""--it takes a minute for your eyes to adjust when you walk in the lobby...at the hotel in Istanbul you had to walk in and out of a series of curtains. The last night in Istanbul all the mood lighting in the room malfunctioned and started coming on anf off.

Anyway, W, if you are listening, maybe put some money into making the rooms more like new again.  The rooms are good-sized and the location and views are top-notch.  Easy fixes, I say. Until then, W Downtown might be a better bet.  Or if you are feeling silly spendy (or have the ole expense account working for you), stay at one of my all time faves, Park Hyatt Water Tower.  Sigh.  No Starwood points there though, my friend.";3;3;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

It looks so plush and stylish in the photos. The first thing we noticed when walking in (besides Billy Zane getting into a limo... now I know it was an omen) was a club atmosphere in the lobby. There were lots of martini drinkers sitting around in sunglasses... The receptionists were too trendy for their own good, and I suspect that the one on the right was faking his English accent. (Oh yeah, they actually tell you to ""take the lift"" here...) In my opinion, it always is a mistake for a hotel staff to come off as condescending, and here, they definitely did. (There are plenty of high-end hotels who operate with friendliness.) We reserved a room with two queen beds, since my sister-in-law was joining us for a couple of days. We got off the elevator (which was scented, a nice touch) and, despite it being full daylight outside, were plunged into club-style darkness. The halls are very dark, with colored lights to guide your walk. When we opened our door, a lot of light was coming in from the big window. (We were on the west side of the hotel, so we had a crappy view of the building next door.) Ambient club music was playing from the small CD alarm clock, and the room looked really clean. Another look, and I realized there were Ws on everything... everything. My God, the room was one big marketing campaign and attempt to sell merchandise (including a $22 bottle of water that had been picked up and passed over so many times the logo had worn off). It was highly annoying to me. I started obsessing about finding everything that was W-branded -- and my finds included a teddy bear, the CD of music playing when we came in, coffee mugs, t-shirts -- and started seeing a lot of wear-and-tear on the room and furniture. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Design on a Dime... like it might look good to last through the photo/filming session, then all the cheap Scandinavian-style laminate furniture and other cost-cutting features start to fall apart and reveal the hotel for what it really is: the illusion of luxury and exclusivity. The most annoying thing, though, was the ""divider"" (yes, I said divider) between the bathroom and rest of the room. There was no solid, latching door, just a woven sliding panel that made comfortable privacy impossible. To boot, the panel in our room was BROKEN, so there was a hole in it. Also, there is a shuttered pass-through between the bathroom and bed area that doesn't fully close off any view or sound. I understand the concept (you can be in bed AND watch your lover take a shower... although the shower curtain was opaque, so I'm not sure what else you could watch), but when a room has two beds, there should be some consideration that lovers might not constitute a full party staying in a room. Not be be crass, but... there's this book called Everyone Poops. I think the W got confused and thought it was called Everyone Needs to Know When Everyone Poops. I give two stars for the beds being comfortable and room service (when requesting towels) being very prompt. Plus, we didn't get robbed... except for our dignity.";2;3;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

I had a ""city view"" room and wasn't impressed with the view. Basically it was looking directly into another hotel or office building, and looking down into an alley. Lake view rooms are the way to go. The W however does shine in the attention to detail department. If you are able to focus listening to the techno music in the elevator you would see the floor mats are updated throughout the day to say ""Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening"", which is something I haven't seen at any other hotel. I attended a wedding on here and the ballroom was converted to a very intimate setting, which was unexpected. The reception was held on the 33rd floor in a nice hall overlooking the lake and city. This was the best part of my stay here. The Whiskey Sky bar on the 33rd floor is dark and small, and drinks are expensive. After one drink in here I had to take off as I couldn't stand being unable to see my hand in front of my face and couldn't move without bumping into someone. Picture being in a walk in closet with the lights off and you'll get the same feel as this place. As others have reported, the lobby doubles as a lounge for the first floor bar at night, so if possible try to avoid this area at night. You won't be able to hear anyone working the counter, and they won't be able to hear you. If you aren't  in 'clubbing' attire you probably will catch a few unwelcoming glances by the older crowd drinking at the bar. Another disappointing  aspect of this joint is the pool on the 7th floor. It leaves much to be desired. Also, don't go into this place looking for a hot tub, because there isn't one to be found. Very surprising for such an expensive place. The gym however looked pretty nice, with free weights, machines, a cardio deck and kettle balls. All in all, if you want to get more bang for your buck, stay somewhere else in the city. If you do find yourself staying here, get a lake view room and hope for good weather so you aren't trapped in a real life version of A Night at the Roxbury.";2;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

As for decor, I'll give them a break, since they are renovating in the next year or two. 2) Overwhelming lemon scent coming from the bed and could not sleep.    We asked housekeeping to change all linens in hopes of ""fixing"" the issue. They did; however, the issue was not resolved.  Come to discover (we discovered, not housekeepping) that somebody poured a substance on the bed and it was simply ""covered up"" and not addressed by housekeeping. Kudos to Grant for moving us to another room, actually a suite. I have an issue with this, too.  I am Platinum with Starwood and they are supposed to automatically upgrade me to the ""best room/suite"" available - but, we did not get a suite until there was an issue.  hmmm... 3) Toilet did not flush properly Issues with room # 2 4) The TV did not work until after we unplugged and reconfigured the wiring. 5) Wireless internet did not work in the suite.  Would go in and out. 6) The light in the living room flickered. 7) The vanity mirror/light shocked my GF when she touched it.  Fortunately, she was wearing shoes with rubber soles. 8) The heater/AC couldn't decide if it wanted to be hot or cold 9) The window covering in the bedroom did not roll up";1;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Overall it's a great property, but the location is a bit inconvenient.  Aside from the proximite to Navy Pier, it's a bit out of the way from the downtown area, or the uptown nightlife. The bar area is very cool with tons of space for people to spread out on a variety of different chairs/couches. On each of the floors, there is a little telescope that allows you to view Navy Pier from an elevated view, which is a nice cool touch. The valet guys are very helpful- they'll waive down cabs that are lined up around the corner of Lakeshore drive.  However, the design of the drop-off/pick-up circle is very odd.  Sometimes you have traffic going in both directions, and in the busy mornings, it's not uncommon to get stuck between a few cars going in different directions.

It's very close to Millennium Park and the Wendella Boat Rides are right next to it. The shops at North Bridge are only 5 blocks away. You can easily walk to Navy Pier as well. It shouldn't take you more than 15-20 minutes. John Hancock Center is quite close too - about a mile away. There are a lot of places where you can eat around.

It was a guitar-loving teenager's dream to be able to check out a guitar and take to our room! I did expect the ""rock star""  theme to be more extreme than it was, as it was a bit subdued, yet tasteful. The entrance was small, dark and had loud music blaring, which was a bit odd, but yet made us feel like we were in for a good time.  It was fun to go floor to floor to see which rock star was featured there and to see some memorabilia.   The room was stylishly decorated. However, it was quite dark in the hallway, and especially the bathroom which made it very difficult for my husband to shave and me to get ready in the morning. There is a very dimly-lit makeup mirror that did little to no good. The beds and pillows were very comfy. My main complaint in the room was the windows - they did very little to drown out the street noise and we were 22 stories high! Drawing the curtains did offer some help, but the blaring sirens that we heard throughout the night sounded like they were right in the room with us. Staff was friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, valet was professional. We had to wait well beyond check-in time for our room to be ready which was a pain, but they gave my husband some free drink tickets to use while we waited. Too bad the free drinks didn't help us as it was a family trip and we aren't big drinkers.

As someone who would rather crash at a friends place when visiting an old city of residence than stay at a hotel in a tourist destination, it was a nice change for once. My friend and I had a Groupon for a good rate, and we had a nice room! It was on a lower level than advertised, but it was still a good view. Right in the heart of some nice places to drink. Each level has a theme for each band and a piece of memorabilia relating to that band. We had the Rolling Stones. I got to stare at David Bowie taking a wee, and sometimes if you're in the right place at the right time, you can run into minor celebrities! Unfortunately, the Check In, Rock Out program requires a $1,000 guarantee in case of any damages. What would have been a potential incentive turned out to be something we couldn't do due to the extraordinary price for a guitar that costs less than that, even for a nice model! However, this was only minor as the experience was very well-received. We also were given a code for free wi-fi that didn't work. We didn't say anything since we didn't need it for anything important. And thinking being a Groupon user would make them incorporate some crazy fees, we only had to pay extra for taxes.

1650;5/9/2010;HqCt;pK1lDJPqCQth68ov6K4ieA;"We reserved a block of rooms at the Hard Rock for our April wedding. While we were passed around to a few different salespeople over the 8 months or so that we spent planning, everyone was very helpful and friendly. We locked down a rate of $149 per night for king rooms, which is a pretty amazing price for that location.  As the husband (like most of our friends) is an architect, we appreciated the fact that the hotel is housed in the historic (and gorgeous) Carbon and Carbide Building. We really wanted our out of town guests to experience the awesomeness of Chicago, and the hotel's location made that extremely easy. We were given a tower suite at the same rate, and the room was HUGE, which made getting ready on the big day very easy. It's true that some of the finishes aren't exactly the highest quality, but you know, it's not the Ritz. The staff was very courteous and helpful, though we did have a couple of glitches. The first had to do with the gift bags we had made for our guests. Originally I had been told that we could have them handed out at check in, and as long as they were all the same and not personalized (i.e., specific bags to specific people) they would do it for free. A week before the wedding I found out that they had changed their policy and now would only distribute bags to the rooms at a $5 per bag fee. They finally agreed to hand them out for free as they had originally promised, though I would imagine we were an exception.   The other snag had to do with the bar- I had spoken (via email) with the bar manager about bringing our guests there after the wedding, which was to end at midnight on Sunday. We weren't going to pre order anything or reserve space, just offer a place for people to hang out, which the bar manager said was fine.  When we got back to the hotel it was close to 1, and the bar was closed (it's supposed to be open till 2).  But everything was solved by a brief talk with the front desk manager who allowed us to hang out in the lobby with the beers we brought back from the wedding (classy, no?).

The first night we stayed in a Deluxe King room and it was cozy but nice. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we didn't land until 8pm and it took an hour to get to the hotel and then we went to grab a late bite. The balance of the stay (3 nights) we stayed the Platinum King which was a corner room with two views of the city. Things I loved: The front desk was really helpful and remembered us. We didn't have to deal with any messy issues and they called us when our room was ready (we had to change our rooms since they were different levels). They stored our bags (for free - in Vegas; they sometimes charge $1/bag). The concierge called us twice to inform us that our room was ready; I thought that was nice in case we were killing time (which we weren't). The hotel sent us a place of fresh strawberries, chocolate fondue and champagne as we were there for a celebration. I thought that was such a nice touch as other hotels we've stayed at on special occasions did not acknowledge at all (despite being listed on reservation). The bathrooms were nice with upgraded amenities. The smell of sweetgrass still gives me a smile as all the products smelled like it. There were lots of mirrors and comfortable beds. I enjoyed the non-down pillow in the closet (with an additional blanket) as I'm allergic to down pillows. Close location to downtown area with lots nearby to eat and hang out. Train stop is only a block away and can utilize to get around city without large cab fees. Your room key gives you a 15% discount to the Hard Rock Cafe although it is about a mile or so (walking). We walked there but there were no directions to it and we thankfully just used our itouch to get there. Cons: Elevators were a bit confusing as only one bay seemed to be functioning despite having 6. Fridge was weighted and so you were unable to use for personal items. I usually prefer to buy my own water as I like to stay hydrated so we had to just drink room temp so we didn't get charged for moving things around in the fridge. There was only one robe in the room and it wasn't as soft as some hotels we've stayed in. Overall, I was impressed with the Hard Rock. We've stayed at many hotels which were pricier and didn't make us feel special or valued. HR definitely made us feel it was worth the value as well as accomodating. We asked for late check-out and they granted us an additional hour. Check-out was painless and we were able to just walk out and leave keys in the room. Would definitely stay there again the next time we visit.";5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

The staff was helpful--especially Concierge Paula Nascimento, as she went out of her way to help us find a late night eatery when we were out-and-about at 10pm on a Sunday night and were calling her on a cell phone...She went the extra mile and checked in with several places to see who was still open and pointed us to a beautiful restaurant/bar called Chaise Lounge in Bucktown (http://chaiseloungechica…).  Truly a great call! The Hard Rock's rates were very reasonable if you book on http://hotels.com.  In the past, we've also stayed at the Allerton Hotel and the Palmer House, both of which we liked.  Overall, however, I would rank the Hard Rock on top, as it really gets the details right and has just the right amount of ""coolness"" to make your stay feel special.";5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

The hotel also has free wifi internet which was a nice touch since so many 4 star hotels charge for 24 use of their internet. I used the concierge to check into my airline and print out my boarding passes. They were quick with getting them for me as I checked out. I do agree with the previous post that paying more than $100-$150 a night is not worth it. But then again thats because I got this for $100 a night off of priceline. I could not imagine paying the $250 a night they wanted through their website. Even with the $25 itunes gift card offer thats just too much to pay for a room.

The pool was nice, and there's a fitness room that seemed fairly well-equipped, aside from the fact that there was only one treadmill. One thing we liked was that each floor has a Chicago theme (ours was The Art Institute), which was charming.  The decor throughout the hotel is faded art deco, and I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. If you're staying for longer than a weekend, though, this place might not be adequate.  Unless you get a suite (which we didn't do), the rooms have no microwaves and other things that come in handy for longer stays.  Also, there's no pay-per-view, and the available channels on the television are limited.  This is something I wouldn't typically complain about (who wants to watch TV on vacation?), but when you've got small kids, like I do, and their sleeping patterns are disrupted by travel, or if it rains, a movie is a good way to spend a little down time. We didn't visit the restaurant attached because it was very much not kid friendly.  There were plenty of other dining options close by, though.

The deck's garden is gorgeous with nice flowering beds and small trees for shade. It overlooks Michigan Ave and has nice views of skyscrapers in both directions.

1697;9/7/2007;v6Rgslf;FnrInTxuy5LY3vEHP8IzpQ;"I have some mixed emotions about the esSEX inn (juvenile, I know, but it makes me laugh).  It was in a great location, walking distance from Millennium Park and some other sites.  And I guess for the price, I shouldn't have expected much. The first night teh boy and I stayed in our own single room.  It was nice and cozy (and by cozy I mean really small).   The rest of our stay in Chicago we were in a bigger room with a few other friends.  And  the air conditioner started leaking.  We let the front desk know, but nothing was done about it.  By the third day, the carpet was soggy.  It squished when you walked on it.  No big deal if you could avoid it, but there were five of us in the room (one sleeping on the floor) so not a whole lot of room to maneuver around the marsh.   The windows in the room were kind of scary too.  We pretty high up and the windows near the floor just open right up to the sky.  No screens or anything.  Good thing we didn't have a baby toddling around or it might have toddled right out onto Michigan Avenue! The elevators were on the fritz during our stay as well.  Only some of the buttons would work, so if you were on one of the floors that it didn't feel like going to, you had to go past it and walk down a flight or two. The restaurant and bar were a joke, but I guess ok in a pinch.  If you want a drink, I suggest going to the Hilton next door. I sort of hold the esSEX inn close to my heart because it was so awful and just made our trip to Chicago that much more memorable and entertaining.";3;1;1;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

Walk right out the door to Grant Park. Makes for a nice morning. They also offer a free hotel shuttle to various touristy places like the hancock tower, navy pier and one of the museums, I forget which one. Also nice. There is an indoor pool, fitness center and a deck on the 4th floor that looks out over michigan ave. The rooms are fine, maybe a bit a small. However, the rest of the inside, like the hallways, stairways, are kind of creepy. Internet there is kind of expensive, and probably the most annoying was that our room didn't have a fridge (we ate two huge meals out in chinatown, and since we didn't have a fridge to bring the doggie bag back to, we threw the food out the second night, which was sad, and went into food coma the first night, which was painful and gross).

1699;6/30/2011;iIg0HeYZCWtdUzLzchCxBg;zxMR33ahIM5xOxH33GK4jQ;"I was in a crunch, needing to book a Chicago hotel room the night before I arrived without any idea where to go, and the Essex Inn came through for me.  Kind of. Located in the South Loop it's within walking distance to the Art Institute and Millennium Park (both a must). However, there is really nothing within the immediate area and you'll have to go at least a mile to get good food. The hotel itself is, well, dated. But, on the upside, you're in Chicago and shouldn't be spending that much time in your hotel anyways. The décor in the entry and lounge area is very, very, very 80s. Clearly their embracing it because the music was basically Raspberry Beret, Just Died in Your Arms and various Duran Duran songs on loop. Given that you basically have to wait 20 minutes for an elevator (which is already a tiny slice of hell) I think this may constitute a verbal assault. The overall feel of the place is that is maybe trendy at some point 20 to 30 years ago and is clutching to it in a fairly depressing way. Hallways are a bit dim. The breakfast was just sad and pathetic. Nothing can be salvaged; I suggest you go down the street to Yolk. The room itself was decently sized, borderline tight, but I could see it being just too small if you wanted to fit 3 or 4 people in. The bathroom was one of those small ones where opening and closing the door becomes a total production. The shower pressure was pretty abysmal and sometimes the water wouldn't heat up until the second shower (it wasn't winter either), but they had good shampoos and soaps (which I totally didn't take with me...). Wifi was so-so. The heater/AC was possibly from the 50s and was entirely dysfunctional.   The people were friendly in that Mid-Western sort of way. I paid around $160/night with taxes.  It was fine since I booked last minute, but you can absolutely find better hotels for better prices in Chicago.";2;2;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

1703;4/30/2011;ltnvD8FO8upbGjEheOaDdQ;-QNqU6eeHw4t2q3b1f0b4g;"Stayed here for 6 nights during the last week of April, 2011.  My wife and I were traveling with our 2 kids, aged 3 1/2 and 9 months.  Now, you have to understand, the main thing about this hotel is the location.  You're not booking a room at the Ritz or the Waldorf/Astoria.  It serves very well as a functional hotel, but if you're looking for 5 star quality, look elsewhere. Having said all of that, we enjoyed our stay here.  The location is on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park.  We booked through Expedia (if I remember right) and got the room for around $120 per night (average...remember, we checked in on a Friday).  We got a room on the 4th floor (14 floors total in the place).  The prior reviews are correct, the room is small...compared to other hotels out there.  If you want to stay in your room the whole time, seek elsewhere.  Our family of 4 was crammed, but we had what we needed.  There is a mini-fridge hidden under the TV (hint:  you can adjust the temperature using the thermostat on the back of the fridge).  There is a coffee bar too so you can brew your own java.  There's a flat-panel TV with plenty to choose from (several HBO channels included).  The sink in the bathroom is no myth...it's SMALL.  It's a round sink; I'd put it at about 10 inches in diameter (no exaggeration here...it's about as big as a soccer ball).  That said, it does it's job...it's a sink people, not a hot tub!  Speaking of tubs, there's one in the room (but it lacks jets, so it's just a tub, not a ""hot"" tub).  The shower head needs an upgrade on the water pressure.  My theory is that there's a pressure reducer in there, but that's just a theory...you decide for yourself.  The toilet also does it's job well.  Our room was on the Hilton side of the building, towards the rear of the hotel, so we had a decent view of the Sears (or whatever it's called these days) Tower.  We were pleased with the room. The staff were very nice throughout our stay.  The housekeeping folks were a little bland, but still tended to our needs (they were like mashed potatoes with no salt & pepper added).  The valet guys were good to us.  The daily parking rate was $37.  That may sound excessive, but the Hilton next door is $55 per day.  We were there for 6 days, so...do the math! The hotel restaurant was undergoing renovations while we were there, so we were provided a ""complimentary"" continental breakfast.  Now, we all know what ""complimentary"" means here:  the price is included in your room rate, so you'd better get down here every morning and scarf down all the pastries & coffee you can consume...AND WE DID JUST THAT!  Seriously though, they could have provided nothing for breakfast, so we were glad to get what we got. There is an indoor pool at the Essex with a lifeguard on duty during regular pool hours.  The pool is ""heated"", and by this I mean ""not outside temperature"".  They have a chart with the pool temperature for guests to see.  The average during our stay was 82 fahrenheit, but I disagree...I think ""lukewarm"" says it all.  In any case, the pool is small, but adequate.  There is also a sauna in the pool area, but sadly, no steam room.  The do pipe in good music in the pool area too (mainly classic rock that isn't too ""classic rock""...i.e. Freebird/Foghat/ACDC/etc).  The exercise room is very good too.  There's 3 bike machines, 3 treadmills, 2 or 3 Elliptical machines, plus several weight machines.  There are a few TV's to watch while working out. As stated in the beginning, the location of this place is key.  Grant Park is across the street, there's a Red Line train stop that's less than a 3-block walk away...you're staying on Michigan Avenue for Pete's sake!  There are several places to eat within a 5-block walk as well.  All in all, we enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone that isn't too picky about the actual hotel they're staying at.  Enjoy your trip!";4;2;1;2;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

Keep in mind that this is an older hotel that has kept their history, so I think renovating or remodeling may be out of the question for them.   The gym is on the very top floor of this hotel, and you have to climb up some stairs in this old creepy stairwell, with steep steps to get to it.  It kinda scared me to tell you the truth, but once you get there, it had pretty much all the gym equipment that you needed, which was nice.  If you are looking for a view while working out though, don't expect it.  There are housekeepers that come and clean the gym as you are there too, so you don't have to worry about the gym being all nasty and dirty.  I know some people don't like to wipe machines down after using them, I guess you don't have to worry about that so much here because the staff keeps it pretty sanitized.   I'd come back and stay again for the convenience.";3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

The event space (Tip Top Tap Room) is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views of the lake and Michigan Avenue. We received complements from everyone at how classy the event space was. The food was excellent: We opted for late night stations which were a big hit.

The only downfall? One elevator was out of service...but it gave us an excuse to use the stairs between floors 17-21 and gave us a little exercise from all of that food. :) THANKS ALLERTON!  We love you guys and can't wait for our 1-year anniversary to see you again for breakfast in bed and a freshly made wedding cake!

It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel. The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down.  I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small. I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card; I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date.

We had a couple issues getting here, it was hard to find while driving since the sign for the hotel is at the top of the building and not by the awning outside. We also weren't sure which parking garage to park in for our parking to be validated. We could have had our car valet  but the valet spot in front was small and taken up by taxi's. We just drove around and pulled our car into the garage ourselves. The lobby is small but nice looking.  The diner was closed each time we came by the front desk. There is a bar right there and it was warm and inviting.  All the staff we encountered were friendly. The standard room is just that, standard. The room was tiny, no coffee pot and certainly not as clean as I would have expected it to be. At first glance, the room looks clean but the bathroom looked like the only thing that had been done was fresh towels added. The counter that runs along the top of the sink was dirty, not dusty but dirty. There were pieces of ""something"" just laying there, not even wiped off. The same with the floor, didn't look like it had been swept. We spent most of our time in the city walking around and seeing the lights. Therefore, the lack of cleanliness wasn't a prime factor in our visit. We were here long enough to get dressed for dinner, sleep and dress for the next day. We took advantage of the late checkout to keep our bags in the room instead of walking around Chicago with them. The Living Social voucher also came with 2 free drinks. We had to ask for the coupons because they were not given to us at the time of check-out.  We asked the bartender for the two free drinks and it turned out that it was a fruity drink with Malibu rum.

Between the six of us in our group, we had three different types of rooms.  I lucked out and paid $104/night for our king suite.  The guys had a two double bed room (decent size) and our other friends got a teeny-tiny queen size petite room.  It's all good though, we only picked this spot for the convenience of its location and the awesome deal we got through TravelZoo's website. I must say, this was the swiftest check-in and check-out at any hotel I've been at. When we arrived at 2:00 after taking a cab from Chicago Midway, we were quickly greeted by the front desk and was able to check into our room right away.  Awesome. We hung out at the lounge a few times to grab a cocktail and some happy hour food. Five stars for having a $5 menu and for having nightly drink specials.   I loved the $5 flavored-vodka special they had on a particular night. The room was kept clean so no complaints there.  We had our own mobile hot spot device so we didn't have to pay to have wifi access in our room, but getting a strong signal between all the buildings was quite the challenge.  Oh well, free wifi in the lounge if you ask the front desk for the access code. Overall, I loved the Allerton Hotel.  I have no complaints since it served its purpose well in the four nights we stayed there and provided a great deal that fit within our budget.  The room wasn't big enough to store a dresser, so I ended up keeping most of my clothes in my suitcase since I had no where else to put it.  Oh well, I still managed. If I return back to Chicago, I know I would not hesitate to stay here again.";4;3;3;2;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

The valet parking was more than we would have liked to spend.  Thankfully, I knew of a parking structure a few blocks away that was less expensive. The elevators were so tiny and besides the lobby, the whole place looked old school to the point of run down. I like a good old school hotel but this was to the point of it looking like it wasn't well kept. The bedroom was fine but had a lot of window dressing in my opinion.  The bed was comfy but the carpeting had some issues.  The shower had rust spots and made me question the cleanliness of the bathroom. Overall, it was a decent experience but I think we would either upgrade our room or look for other options.   I can't give it a great rating but won't give it a horrible rating either. PRO'S: Proximity to Michigan Ave Lobby Area CON'S: Check in on the 2nd floor (fairly confusing) Cleanliness of the bathroom Price of Parking";3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I was solo, and YELP was my travel companion! I therefore felt compelled to copy & paste my April post from another community forum so that my fellow yeeps could benefit..... Having stayed here previously in a very small room, I was sure to ask for a larger room with 2 beds when I made the reservation although I was a solo traveler. I had room 1618 and it was very good. Their website reservations are very clear about the square footage of each room - so pay attention when you book so you don't end up an unhappy traveler. There are some rooms that are TINY, TINY.  Dollhouse-like! Location: Excellent, excellent. In the middle of the Mag Mile. Need I say more? Rooms: No tub in mine - only a shower. Counter space was very limited - just a shelf below the mirror. Room had 2 flat screen tvs, sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Free internet. Mini bar, but no refrigerator or coffee maker that you can use in room. Full length mirror and in room safe. Lobby: Elevators are quite small, but there are 3 available. Check in is on the 2nd floor. One computer on 2nd floor you can use to print your boarding passes. Service: I had very limited contact with any staff - so I can't venture an opinion. Food: I was so close to dozens of restaurants that I did not eat at the hotel. I would definitely stay here again, BUT will surely ask for a big room again";4;2;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I didn't feel my room was small but I did get a King size. It was big enough for two people and all their stuff for a long weekend Chicago adventure with friends. We weren't there except to sleep, shower, and get jazzy looking to go out. Only complaint, was that the shower drain had HAIR in it. EEEEW. GROSS. That is a huge negative.

We were told that we'd have to wait till around 5pm, along with many other people, to get a room with a queen sized bed because they were ""fully committed"".  I'm normally very easy going, but come on - it's New years eve and we've got plans.  So now instead of getting to workout and nap before our dinner resos, we're hurrying. The rooms are tiny and the doors are thin.  We got back around 3am, and our next door neighbors kept throwing things at our door all night.   All in all, I'd only stay here again if I got a great rate, as you can find better deals at better hotels in the area.";2;2;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

1731;3/3/2012;os1VbXO9Dbx7ndFlPZrV7A;g3pUQClm1XCXiYSwsJElfQ;"Hello- I sent the following complaint to your hotel on February 12th and still haven't heard back. I am getting very frustrated and would like a response. Yesterday (2/11/12) I used my Groupon for the Allerton Hotel in Chicago. From what I understood, there were a lot of Groupons redeemed this weekend. However, that should not affect my stay. At first I was not going to say anything, but I decided to write because I really do not feel like the value of my stay was worth what I paid for it. When I first arrived, I had to wait more than 25 minutes to check in, in your lobby space that is not equipped for long lines. After I checked in, I had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator because this hotel is NOT equipped for large groups. By the time I finally got to my room, I had already been in the hotel almost an hour. Everytime I had to take the elevator (I was on the 24th floor..stairs were not an option), we had to send someone into the hall first to press the button because it took at least 10 minutes. I understand these are complaints you probably hear often and I know the Allerton is an older hotel. However, because of this, it seems to me like it would be a bad idea to allow all of these Groupons to be scheduled on the same weekend. Other hotels I have used with Groupon have made sure to limit the number redeemed each weekend and that seemed to work well. Our room had not been properly cleaned after the last guests. We wanted to purchase from the mini-bar, but when I opened it there was almost nothing in it. The mini-bar was full of empty wrappers and candy canisters left over from the last guests. I called the Front Desk and was assured I would not be charged for this, but that did not make me feel better. To me, that shows they did not take the proper care in cleaning and makes me wonder what else they didn't clean. From that point on, I felt uncomfortable in the room. Also, whoever was there before us set an alarm for 4am and the housekeeper must not have re-set it or checked because the alarm woke us up at that time this morning. After that, housekeeping came to the room at 9:00am to clean. This made no sense to me, because we only stayed for one night and check out was at 12:00pm. Why would they come that early? This morning, I called ahead for my car at 11:15am. I understood it could take up to 30 minutes. The car didn't arrive until after 12:00pm. Other people in line said they were waiting for over an hour for their car. During this time I waited outside. At no point did the doorman or any of the valet ask me which car was mine or if I had been helped. I am someone who uses Groupon all the time and this was my first bad experience. It will definitely make me think twice before purchasing a Groupon again and I will not be returning to the Allerton.  After telling my parents of this experience, they called and cancelled their reservation as well and will be contacting Groupon for a refund.";1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

The hotel itself is OK (but very small - it's easy to see it's from a different era). When we checked in, the worker said, ""I'm going to put you in a suite with two beds."" I replied, ""King suite?"" as that's what we had booked, and she said yes. We got up to our room to find they had put us in with two doubles! When we called the front desk, they said that was an ""upgrade"" because the room is slightly larger. Yes, it was, but a double bed is no substitute for a king. Eventually we got a new room. It's a cute boutique hotel, but nothing about it screams luxury to me. The front desk was snotty both at check in and check out, the room service was very limited (although that worker was extremely nice), the bellhop/doorman/valets all wouldn't help us find a taxi, and it took almost 20 minutes for the valet to get us our car!!

Cons: - No grandeous entrance into the hotel. Door is on Huron, not Mich Ave. - Crazy elevator system. You have to first go to the 3rd floor, which is the real entrance/lobby.

Style:  I love the old school feel of certain hotels so I'm biased, but the Allerton was outstanding in this regard.  After a few drinks in the bar it wouldnt have been a far stetch to visualize it as being the 1920's...except for that whole Prohibition thing. Service:  The front desk attendants were somewhat standoffish, but all other hotel personel were very friendly. Con's: Tempurature:  It was fairly warm in our room and we couldnt lower the thermometer to offset the heat.  It seemed to be an innacurate read.  Overall not too bad, just something we noticed.

We booked a room through a discount site for a belated anniversary staycation.  The location of the Allerton is excellent, which is primarily why we chose it.  I noted on our reservation that we were celebrating, and upon arrival the front desk agent kindly wished us Happy Anniversary and offered an upgrade at no cost.  So sweet - thank you, Allerton! I expected a teeny tiny room based upon the reviews I've seen here, but we were delighted to find a two room suite (bedroom/living room) with two large screen TV's, a desk, a large bathroom, and a King bed.  I do agree with those folks who say that the toiletries are minimal...no lotion?  I actually mentioned that to my husband, I just assumed they had forgotten ours.  Also, no wash cloths?  That was odd to me, though it certainly wasn't a big deal. We ordered room service for breakfast in the morning, and as per usual in a hotel, the bill was quite high.  The food arrived on time and tasted fine, nothing to write home about.  I do appreciate that they accommodated a couple of special requests.  If I could do it over again, I would not order room service, primarilly for the cost.

The location is what this place is really all about.  Just blocks from Watertower Mall and other Magnificent Mile shopping.

My only serious complaint would be the $48 for overnight valet.  That's a little steep for Chicago but my car was brought up quickly and the valet staff was friendly and professional.

Then once we got there and let them know that we tried to call, they never apologized but said that our room was ready and we could check in. but not 30 seconds later we were told that we had to wait, and that they would call us when our room was ready. Once we got a call, about an hour later, we went up to the room (the hotel is old and elevators take forever! but its not too bad) which was small, but clean and nice. The room itself was not bad. Since the building is old everything is smaller, from the rooms, to the hallways, to the elevators. The walls are also SUPER thin, you could probably hear your neighbor sneeze if it was a good one. The worst part of our stay was that the hotel NEVER answered the phone. No matter if it was to ask for more towels or to verify the time of the check out. And if that wasn't bad enough, when we checked out they didn't even say 'thank you' or 'hope you enjoyed staying with us'. All we were told when we got down to the front desk was 'you guys already paid, you can go'. If that's not great customer service i don't know what is! I recommend finding another hotel in Chicago to stay at. You can find deals on hotels for about the same price all over the city. So save yourself the trouble.";1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Boo!  Hiss!  For charging a minimum of $9.95 per day for in-room internet service (even more dough for faster speeds).  You can get free Wi-Fi in the Second Floor lounge if you would prefer to surf in public. I was on the 9th floor with a western view of Michigan Avenue, so there was nothing to shout about there.  My friend was on a higher floor on a corner and enjoyed her combo view west and north. Room service was always prompt and courteous.  Skip the bar on the Second Floor.  It is dead, dead, dead.  But, if you want to grab a bite to take back to your room, the $5 sliders and $5 quesadilla are a good value. The gym on the 25th floor was well stocked with all the equipment one would expect, and was never busy. There is free coffee on the Second Floor each morning, and you can also use a computer kiosk there to check in for your flight home.";3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Airlines use this hotel for their staff, and if you're there when they are coming or going, good luck trying to get an elevator, a cab, service from the bellhop, etc. The elevators can fit maybe 1 person with luggage and 1 other person.  They are extremely small and there are few of them so it takes awhile to get to your room.  I waited 6 minutes for an elevator, which doesn't seem like much.  But after a day of touring the city, tired feet, being hungry, etc., 6 minutes is 6 minutes too long to be waiting for an elevator.";3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

1753;8/6/2010;BcvMCmhWBxba7OqVtFV2TQ;iZfPxKDl6HuKzulg2U8fXw;"Man oh man.  Where do I start? First of all, I had pre-paid in FULL for a king room.  When we checked in, we were placed in a tiny queen.  I'd understand the change in reservation given the circumstance that I had only placed a reservation to be paid at check-out.  However, if I pay for something in full ahead of time, I expect that reservation to be honored as promised.  The room we were placed in was in front of the service elevator, and there were meaty spiders inside the room all along the window sill (windows were closed, by the way).  At this point I was annoyed.  I called front desk and the agent I spoke to apologized and promised to move us into an available suite for the remainder of our stay the next morning and would also send us breakfast on the house.  He told us to just come down in the morning after we eat and that everything would be taken care of without any extra trouble or cost.  My boyfriend and I figured that we could tolerate our tiny closet full of spiders for a night. We went to bed, figuring that all was well and that things would be rectified in the morning. Wrong. So I go down the next morning, and the agent who ""helped"" me, Kevin, was a total douchenozzle.  I kindly explained what had happened the night prior and he said he couldn't place me in a new room, sneering as he said ""I don't know what you're talking about.""  Mind you, he spoke before even looking up my guest information and checking notes that had been left by the agent previously.  I told him that if there was a problem, I would not mind speaking to his manager.  At which point he snapped ""I AM the manager.""  He then pulled my information up on the screen and said,""Ohhhh I see"" and rolled his eyes at me. Long story short: after more sneering ensued and talking to me like I was stupid, Kevin rudely sent me away and told me to come back ""whenever"" instead of giving us an estimated time when our room would be ready.  THEN he called our room and curtly demanded that we pack our stuff and it would be stowed in storage because he needed our current room NOW.  It was 11 AM and check out was not until noon.  Check in isn't even until 3.  First of all, our reservation was goofed.  Then our alternate room wasn't ready.  And now you're rushing us out of our current room with no where else to go?  Nice. By the time the bellhop arrived at our door, I had decided that I no longer wanted to stay at the hotel and wanted my money back.  I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman helping us, Carlos, if there was another manager I could speak to besides Kevin since the service was terrible.  Carlos then said,""Hmmm...I'm the front desk manager.  I oversee him.""  Interesting.  I ultimately got my money back and will never return to this hotel.  There's a right way and a wrong way to rectify mistakes.  Had Kevin been apologetic, truthful, and courteous from the get-go, there would have been no problem.  I work in customer service also and I understand that mistakes happen.  However, I did not pay good money to be given sub-par service and a terrible attitude when I can get treated like sh*t for free on the street.  I left a voicemail for the general manager, who was not in office that day.  The director of operations did follow up with me, and I appreciated his efforts in earnest.  He apologized, stated that the service given by Kevin was not the kind of service the Allerton strives to provide, and offered to take care of any future accomodations the next time I plan on being in town.  I kindly declined, stating that my experience was colored in a really negative way.  Unfortunately, a bad apple did spoil the bunch and I would rather spend my money elsewhere.   Not to mention that you can find a much nicer, roomier hotel with much more pleasant staff in the city for less money.   Do not stay at the Allerton unless you WANT to have a bad night.";1;3;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I ended up getting a Groupon for some reason and received 4 glasses of complimentary wine at the hotel bar. That place was great. They serve you a little bowl of snack nut mixture while your laying on the couch watching all the guests walk by. Now the downers, renting movies at night $15 per movie (and not the dirty ones), wi-fi, you had to pay a fee per day.

I also enjoyed the free hot chocolate that they would serve in the mornings and evenings at the lobby. Seeing the marshmallows and chocolate bits melt into my hot chocolate made me giddy. Hehe. :) Another great plus, is the LOCATION. Right on Magnificent Mile where all the good shopping and good food take place. :) I think the only complaint I have are the tiny and slow elevators that don't even have sensors. They only stay open for a few seconds, then afterwards, it'll just smoosh you as you're getting in. Although, I WAS in the elevator with Michael Phelps. So that was cool. I swear, that was him.

So of course Hotwire was running some deal, where you could get a fight and a room at the Allerton for some really ridiculously low rate. So rather than booking directly through the Hotel, my out of town relatives booked through Hotwire. Knowing this, I called my contact at the hotel who will be called ""MK"" in this review and added everyone to the list. I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with MK so that everyone that was checking in would get the out of town bag etc. So when check in date came along, I was told by my mother-in-law that no one was getting bags!!! As you can imagine this is the LAST thing I wanted to deal with after having spent HOURS on the phone with MK and being charged $3 bucks a bag so they could sit there and not be distributed. I had to call the hotel after my rehearsal to iron out the issues. It appears that MK left no list at the check in counter and no one knew what to do, even though I had dropped off 20 bags to be given out. The best part is that I was still charged for ""distribution"" after having gone through this pain in rear experience. MK was less that pleasant to deal with, so please be cautious if you are ever considering a room block here. Be prepared to make phone calls and supervise the night before your wedding.

There was a large LCD TV in each room, an iPod docking station in the parlor and the best part, an iMac computer with free wireless! I didn't even have to bring my laptop. A mini fridge is only $20 for your entire stay. I would recommend walking over to Wal-greens and buying some drinks instead of using the minibar.";4;5;2;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

As far as bang for your buck goes, I was blown away by this hotel. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were relatively cheap, but still enormous. The standard king sized room that I stayed in had a couch, and a work desk on top of other standards like lounge chairs and TVs. There was a rooftop bar and pool that were a great way to end a relaxing day exploring Chicago. Even for someone used to traveling on a budget, the Avenue doesn't come close to breaking the bank.

I was in a Comfort Suites near O'Hare yesterday, and today, the room I'm in at the Avenue (which costs much more) is smaller than most hotel rooms I stay at in 4-to-5-star hotels. My room overlooks the roof of another building. My flat panel TV gets 16 channels, most of which are local/network. Valet parking is either $45 or $49, more than the cost of renting the car for the day. I couldn't get an answer because there was utter chaos at check in. No organization at all. My room wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. I had to wait 45 (!) minutes for a room to become available, so I just surfed the Internet on my laptop while I waited. Did I get anything in compensation? Nope. Even more confusing? My reservation calls this place the Crowne Plaza. Everything else calls it the ""Avenue."" The sign outside says both. Which is it?

We asked Emily to give us a city view as high up as possible.  At first she had us on the 32nd floor and when we returned to check in she had booked us on the 39th floor which is the highest floor with rooms. The pool and breakfast lounge is on the 40th floor which is top floor.  The view from room 3909 is fanastic.  This room is a king suite which has a leather couch witha pull out bed which is where our two kids slept.  The mattress was awesome and so comfortable.  Nice flat screen TV, closet space, and did I mention the excellent view. The waterfall shower head was nice but water pressure was not the best either because of the age of the plumbing or it was equipped with a water reducer or both.  It was fine for me, but the wife wished it would have had more pressure.  Not a deal breaker though. We would definitely stay here again.  Very close and centrally located to about everything we wanted to do. The roof top pool was awesome.  The views from there are excellent as well.  Since it was 90+ degrees it was busy during the day but in the evening it was manageable.  The first night which was a Sunday we had the pool to ourselves for awhile which was nice.  I thought the $250 per night average including taxes was very reasonable for all things considered.  Free wi-fi and they did not charge a seperate fee for the pool which alot of places do.  They have parking on site for $50/day but we took the train.  Cab ride to the train station is about $15.00 including tip. Navy Pier, Chinatown, and Willis Tower is all $15.00 or less each way too.  All the shopping, Hancock, and tons of excellent restaurants can easily be reached by foot.  This will be the only hotel we stay at for future visits to Chicago.  Highly recommend the Avenue Crowne!";5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

There's nothing special about the rooms.  The bedding is just ""meh"".  On the 9th floor, the air conditioning never seems to be correct  It was colder in the room than it was in the refrigerator. Speaking of odd things, there's no dresser space.  Where am I supposed to store my man panties?  There's a closet, but honestly - I'm not going to hang my Andrew Christians up.  Drawer space!  Whatever space there might have been under the giant TV was taken up with the minibar offerings. The bathroom was very nice and had a tub, which I prefer over a standing shower - as long as it's clean.  The Drake does housekeeping very well.  Excellent soaps, shampoo, conditioner & body creams as well. As pointed out by Omar, there's no wifi in the rooms. So, be prepared to shell out $12.95 a day for internet access that requires an ethernet jack or bring your own internet access stick. The food, though, was quite good and I have to give the Drake a lot of praise for doing gluten free very well.   I can take a so-so room.  I can't take terrible food.  This was pretty darned good, and I was the envy of my colleagues all week, as my employer arranged for special meals at breakfast and lunch. If you have mobility issues, this could be a rough patch if you're using the meeting space.  Lots of stairs.  Frankly, I loved the stairs.  It was the only exercise I got - and I did lust for the very nice gym which features Precor equipment across multiple rooms.   The front desk staff is superb and the security is very good.  I got the fish eye once or twice as I meandered back from Jamba Juice.  Perhaps it was the tight jeans and t-shirt?  I just didn't dress the part of a Drake guest, perhaps.

It seems that the Saturday night I was there is the ballroom/social dancing night.  It was wonderful to see the women in their pretty floral dresses and heels, while the men were decked in their jackets. One gentleman brought his dancing shoes in a separate bag, changed from brown and black deck shoes into glossy black dress shoes.  In an instant, he was up and out on the dance floor with a woman - where she came from, I haven't a clue - and was gliding his way around the floor.   It is a civilized evening.  The songstress croons soulfully and the band plays silky, sensual music.  Those who happen to stumble on this event are largely unaware of what is taking place and try to blend in with the regulars.  They take a few brave chances with their dance steps, but soon realize they are neophytes. Perhaps this venue was one of the predecessors to the ""So You Think You Can Dance"" idea!  The dancing moves were amazing! And the ""Powder Room!""  Unlike anything I've ever seen.  I'm a 50-something from Hawaii and have traveled around the world, but I've not been in a magnificent, elegant ladies room such as this.  The sign above the doorway actually says ""Powder Room"" - not ""Women"" or ""Ladies"" or anything else. Each stall is exquisitely decorated and there are even plush velveteen footstools to sit on.  There is even a sink in each stall.  Large handtowels and tissues are generously provided.

But, I've been fortunate enough to have been the guest at some cool soirees at this fancy pants hotel and I'm quite impressed with the way they run shop. To begin with, no matter which side of the hotel in which you enter, you know you're in for a treat. Ample staff, click-clacky floors, lots of gilded stuff and mirrors that allow me to ogle myself and say, ""D@mn, I'm looking good tonight!""... these are all pluses. From the check-in staff to doormen to waitstaff, I've never had anyone be less than helpful. I don't know if folks are, genuinely happy to work here or fantastic actors but, as a guest, I appreciate the charm and hospitality. It goes noticed. The ballrooms are exactly what you'd imagine a ballroom in an old, majestic hotel to be: opulent, historic, mysterious, and achingly romantic. I think my favorite thing about the ballrooms are the views. The windows are floor-to-ceiling and they look out at some of the most incredible views of Lake Michigan that you'll ever see. A nighttime view -- in the winter -- at the crashing waves, foamy crests and pitch waters can put a spell on you if you let it. Let it. After your betwitching is over, look up. Gaze high at the ceiling and then let you view go long. The rooms are so much higher and deeper than what they initially appear to be. Yet, despite the depth, acoustics are never a problem. I don't know whether this is a modern sound-engineering miracle or structural engineering foresight from long ago but whatever the reason, again, it's appreciated and noticed. Getting a chance to dress up in fancy clothes and attend fancy black-tie affairs is fun (for me). Getting the chance to do so in a historical, mouth-dropping venue like The Drake is an incredibly opportunity you should take, if offered. While things, in general, seem to go towards new! younger! hipper!... there's a reason why classics are classics... and why classics are classy. Be classy.";4;13;14;9;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

Being such a Chicago landmark, I thought it was going to be as neat as the Intercontinental. The Drake has really old, impressive finishes and the workout room is super impressive (weird comment, I know, but there were wood arched ceilings in there and it was HUGE). But we were really hoping there would be a hot tub (which there wasn't), the fridge in our room was smelly, and they don't let you open the window. Plus we had room service knock on our room twice while we were there, which made us feel like they were trying to hurry us out. Overall, if I were going to pick an old Chicago hotel to stay in, I think I'd still pick the Intercontinental.";3;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

The food in all the hotel's restaurants is excellent. From the fancy ""Cape Cod Room"" to the ""Drake Brothers"" restaurant, and the ""Coq D'or"" bar (with a more casual menu), you really can't miss. The lobby is very impressive with an amazing central flower arrangement and be sure to spend some time in the ""Palm Court"" with its' own water feature and flower display. ""High Tea"" is served every day from 1 to 5PM. Tip: it is worth it to get an executive level room as you will then have access to their executive lounge on the 10th floor.

Minus two stars because the Drake gave me the wrong key to my room FOUR times.  Which means I had to go back to the scene of the accident FOUR TIMES.  And be stared at by the staff who so thoughtfully helped me FOUR TIMES.  And had to relive my epic fall FOUR TIMES.  How would you feel having to pass by the same person who just saw you flowing BLOOD THROUGH YOUR NOSE again not just 2 minutes earlier?  Might I remind you I hadn't yet gotten a chance to get to my room yet... so I still had BLOOD STAINS on my clothing.  Oh, I don't know if I mentioned - FOUR TIMES.";3;19;20;48;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

Got to love that! What can I say about this hotel - the REAL CHICAGO - that hasn't been written before? This historical landmark hotel was the home of many royals, celebs, & in the known people from the Queen to princess Dianna, from many of our former presidents to celebs. So if it was good for them, it's plenty good for small people like me. What I love about this hotel was the perfect location, a few steps to the beach, a short walk to the Oak Street shops, & to the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of restaurants inside the hotel, especially the afternoon high tea,  offer plenty of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. Did I mention the insanely gorgeous Chanel Boutique that I drool each time I stay here. Not to forget the beautiful flowers shop with the cutest dog ever looks just like my late dog. & how can I forget the crystal chandeliers & fresh flowers through out the hotels, simply classic elegant real Chicago landmark. P.S. I also earn points with Hilton Honors too!";4;5;5;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

I didn't want to have to deal with cabs or waking up even earlier for the test, so I just booked a room. My key did not work. I went to get another key. It worked once. Each time I had to enter the room, I had to go back down to the lobby to get a new key. It was so irritating. Additionally - no internet in the rooms. What. The. F.? I get the idea that the only people using the Drake anymore are business men who want to rack up Hilton points and businesses who schedule conferences here. Thus, you NEED internet in the rooms. Additionally, it costs $7.50 / hr to log into WiFi in the lobby. That's absurd. There are three things in this place that say luxury: the huge floral arrangement in the lobby, an excess of crystal light fixtures, and the bedding. Otherwise, this is a totally average hotel with tiny rooms and tiny bathrooms. Our bathroom had a magnification mirror that was affixed to the wall a good foot over my head.

I was horrified to see that a hotel as glamorous as the Drake was using Priceline.  To think that regular people could be walking on the same outdated carpets and watching the same so-90s TVs as Judy Garland or the English Royal Family at $100 per night made me not want to eat for the rest of the week.  Lucky for me it was Ramadan. My two stays at the Drake have been like old-fashioned film noir love-making.  The little sofas in the elevators are to die for.  Who would ever think of putting sofas in their elevators?  Even my luxurious condo in my homeland Dania Beach does not have sofas in the elevators. Ya, and for a building with Chanel on the ground floor, I think Coco would have a chemical reaction to some of the guest rooms.  Go suite or go home.  The regular guest rooms felt dark and dreary.  Old-world style has been replaced for a reason.  I think I've rennovated myself more times in the past six months than the Drake has since 1920. So why give 4 stars you say?  hEllO, this one's easy: because the Drake isn't a hotel.  It's a museum with cleverly-disguised bedrooms.  Of course--because if you pay the same for the chic Swissotel down the street you can't say you walked on the same carpet as Prince Charles, or stood in the same lobby as Frank Sinatra.  And why people complaining about internet??  Of cOUrsE they charge a lot for internet usage in your room, hEllO.  Who goes to a museum and surfs the web?  Not anyone I know. If you want to surf the web or stay in a ""hotel,"" then go to the Best Western in Lakeview.  There is free internet and you're surrounded by gay people, all lovely, but you can't say that you slept in the same place as Frank Sinatra.  Only his wife can say that, or people who have stayed at the Drake. I won't talk about the price of this museum because I don't like to talk about money.  But if I did like to talk about money, I'd say that this museum's entrance fee is pricey on a per/night basis, but could you imagine how much the MoMa would fine you if they caught you sleeping overnight in the Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Gallery?  You are getting 'quite' the bargain.

1818;9/8/2011;1huoCCsTOJKccs4H0GJGUg;W-VCxiLlTkM4VMJ8BZVFzw;"An Open Letter to The Drake Hotel: I have to say that I was most displeased with the way The Drake Hotel handled a situation early Saturday morning. Just before 1am on 9/3/11, I awoke to screaming from a friend of mine: ""SOMEONE JUST RAN OUT OF OUR ROOM!"" The two of us who had retired just after midnight awoke startled and saw our other friend who awakened us run out of the room. While we slept, someone had entered our room and taken the cash ($300) out of my friend's wallet on the nightstand next to the bed. They then proceeded to reach over me while I slept on my cot and took the cash out of my wallet ($250), which was on the floor next to me. They then left the room and encountered our friend in the hallway. The security staff at The Drake Hotel was less than helpful. They took a report and left us with the phrase, ""Well, these things happen."" When we asked them to call the police for us the best they could do was give us a phone number (the wrong one) and we had to call CPD ourselves. The police have been most helpful and the detective in charge has informed us that he thinks he knows who committed the crime. These leads me to believe that this is probably not the first time something like this has happened at The Drake. I am most bothered by two things. First, at no time were we dealt with as victims of a crime by the staff at The Drake. Rather, we were treated like ignorant tourists, unaware of life in Chicago. There was no sympathy - only bored indifference. Secondly, The Drake has a stated policy behind the front desk that says no one without a key card will be allowed in after midnight. When we arrived back to our room on Saturday AFTER MIDNIGHT, no one stopped us to check our room key or even acknowledged our presence. Sunday after midnight however, we were stopped - a welcome change to be sure but TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. This incident could have been so much worse and I am still haunted by the ""what ifs."" What if I had woken up as some criminal reached over me to grab my wallet? It is not a far stretch to imagine that I could have been injured or even killed. Would the staff of The Drake have cared then? My group has been coming to The Drake for years in order to celebrate Notre Dame's opening weekend. We have always assumed that we would be safe inside her walls - an assumption that we will never make again. Not only has The Drake Hotel lost our business but it, along with the entire Hilton chain, has lost our trust. Since The Drake Hotel has decided to ignore our situation and refuses to even regard it with an apology, I will take all measures to spread the word about what happened. Along with passing a warning to visitors on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media avenues, I also intend to publish an editorial regarding the event in my magazine. I'm sad that it has come to this. I expected better from such a reputable American institution.";1;13;0;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

The Drake Hotel offers just that for $31. I originally thought the price was a bit high, but after going, I think it's well worth it. When we arrived, we were a bit confused on where to go. There are signs pointing the way to the tea room, so be sure to look for them. I did not see them and god knows how long it would have taken for me to find the area. I usually just wander. Anyway, once they took out coats, we were seated right away. The tea room, while large, was incredibly crowded. I didn't think having tea like this was popular, but apparently it is. I ordered the Irish Breakfast Tea, and it was wonderful. We were brought these large tea pots that were refilled with hot water constantly, as well as finger sandwiches, scones, and a variety of desserts. The finger sandwiches originally didn't look very good, but after trying a few I thought they were amazing! The scones were so-so, but the desserts were terrible.

No riff-raff lounging around as in New York's Waldorf=Astoria. However, some of the aspects of the Drake that can be cited for their traditional charm, such as the mirrored elevators with their upholstered benches, also betray the need for some updates. Service, including check-in, was as it should be-- quick, seamless, and nearly invisible. The rooms are highly variable, but even the standard ones are large enough. Quality everything, from bedding to bath supplies, but some things felt a bit in need of an update, such as the carpet and chair upholstery. It's possible to be traditional without being fusty. Where the Drake really shines the most, though, are in its restaurants. The Palm Court is a true delight. Beautiful room and furnishings, delicious tea and food (it's far more than it initially looks), impeccable service, and a harpist. It's quiet and relaxing while being social. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, come for the tea. Breakfast at the Drake Bros was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, with an enormous selection and, again, impeccable service.

I hated that my girlfriend and I ended up in a smoking room after explicitly requesting a non-smoking room and I really hated that they lost/hadn't moved our bags from the smoking room to the non-smoking room on day two of our stay. It took multiple calls to the front desk from our new non-smoking room and a visit to the front desk to get this resolved. We got a coupon for a free breakfast for having to stay in the smoking room. For the lost bags they offered another breakfast coupon. Pathetic. I informed the staff that I would stay at the Peninsula on my next visit as a result of the lost bags and the subsequent coupon offer.

The staff at The Drake treat their guests like royalty and, with the beautiful lobby and glamorous history, you will feel like royalty as well. My mom and I stayed here last summer in one of the suites. However, they had overbooked that night and ended up having to place us in a smoking wing. My mom is extremely sensitive to smoke smell and I don't care for it either. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it so they upgraded our room. The suite we ended up getting was beautiful-- it was a corner room so it was bigger than most and had a wonderful view of the lake. We actually witnessed a tornado by watching it sweep across the lake from the safety of our room. I'm a big fan of historic buildings and luxurious and over-the-top decor. Give me blood red velvet curtains and gold embossed leather walls and I'm a happy woman. So you can see why I was so impressed with The Drake. The clientele this hotel attracts is equally impressive. I was in the tea room the same day a woman was throwing her bridal shower there. When I went to the powder room (really, ""bathroom"" doesn't do it justice), I overheard the woman crying about a lost diamond ring and her friends trying to convince her it's not a big deal at all. You can bet I was on the floor looking for it. The Drake is a wonderful place to stay if you're on a vacation that you want to make extra glamorous, decadent or special. On that same note, I wouldn't recommend it to business travelers as there are no office-type amenities and, while the service is great, the staff tend to take their time.";4;0;0;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

It's an icon... looking all magnificent and dignified when you see it while driving down LSD.   A good friend of mine decided to use his points to treat my husband and myself to a night downtown for my birthday. The Mr. had bought tickets for Mary Poppins and was taking me out for sushi... it was shaping up to be a pretty bitchin' birthday. Check in: quick, painless. Lobby is impressive. Rooms: Frankly, I've stayed in better hotels that charge less per night. What you're getting at the Drake is location... well... that and customer service (supposedly). The beds were comfy, the bathroom nice but it all left me underwhelmed. Except for the view. The view of LSD was awesome.  The beds were super comfy... I will certainly give them that. A run down of our experience:   Customer service: not great. Not even good.  My friends had decided to order us some appetizers and a birthday cake and have it delivered to our room.  They requested it be delivered after 6:00 to ensure that we were settled in before it came.  Pretty much moments after we got into our room at 3:30-ish, we had a knock on the door.  The spread was awesome but I feel bad that our friends had requested a specific time and it was disregarded.  Oh well.  So we went out, had a great evening... had a great sleep... then upon checkout, saw that the room had been charged for the cake and apps that our friends had sent.  Me being the one who never wants to create trouble just told my husband to charge the expense... it was a nice thought but they shouldn't have to pay for our cake.  But he insisted just in case we were BOTH charged for that goofy cake.  So, he called our friends who were then embarassed.  It took a few minutes for us to clear it up at the hotel but our poor friend was dealing with it for days.   I guess the long and the short is that we were supposed to have awesome customer service and didn't get it.  Super disappointing.  If we ever want to do a night downtown again, we might as well go to the Westin or something down the street that is going to be cheaper with better service.   But MANY THANKS to our generous friends that hooked up the room and treats!  :)";3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

It was certainly very beautiful. The next night we actually ended up staying at The Talbott hotel because this place was booked, so after that stay, I could see why I prefer boutique hotels better, like The Talbott.  The Drake had a lot of beautiful chandeliers and the atrium was amazing. I enjoyed the many references to the Queen of England, which made the place seem more regal. I did feel like I was on a special vacation being there, but the nice luxury 'special' touches that The Talbott had were missing from The Drake. Perhaps it's because it's owned by the Hilton and every Hilton hotel room is standardized the same, so that charm was kinda missing. Either way, it was a beautiful hotel and our view of Lake Michigan was really nice. We also snuck a peek of all the ballrooms and wow, are they BEAUTIFUL! What an amazing place to get married in! The one thing that really made it seem less charming was their breakfast buffet. Our waiter took a little while and the buffet was a little over $20 for nothing outstanding at all.

Just to make sure I didn't put my eggs all in one basket, I went to look at several other venues such as the River East Arts Center, The University Club of Chicago, Metropolitan Club, and Spiaggia. Nothing read Chicago elegance like the Drake. Kate Strause was amazing from the day we said we wanted our wedding here, up until the day after our wedding, when she arranged to have some belongings we forgot at the hotel delivered to my brother's house. Every little detail was perfectly in order and made our wedding feel truly 5-star without any ""attitude,"" which was very important to the both of us. She even helped us with our strict kosher requirements and was an excellent liason with Daniziger, our caterer.";5;4;2;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

I made reservations over the phone which was easier than doing it online because online (via phone) I kept getting an error message. The reservation was from 1pm. The reservation deskperson had told me not to be more than 10 minutes late as they don't hold reservations past that time. Each seating is 1 hr and 30 minutes so we were there until 2:30. The Palm Court is in the lobby area and the hotel is beautifully decorated for Xmas. Also, if you have the dough to spend, the Chanel store is attached to the hotel. There is a very tall, well decorated tree when you go up the stairs to the Palm Court area from the lobby. It is definitely worth a kodak moment. The hostess was very polite and seated us immediately. There was only one waiter and at least 7 tables of people seated for tea. With the afteroon tea, they serve 4 types of sandwiches, egg salad, cucumber tomato, asparagus/ham and roast beef. My sister didn't want the beef so we got extra egg salad sandwiches. They were all very good but I would have loved a choice of breads for the sandwiches. Also the tea came with our choice of tea, we each got a teapot. I had the dulce and she had the pear caramel. They allow you to try other teas and so we also tried the chocolate peppermint. My favorite was pear caramel. Also, the tea came with 4 small pastries, raisin scones and banana bread. The scones were soft and still warm. Overall, the service was decent and they constantly filled our teapots with water.The ambious is great but for $33 a person plus tip,  it may be more worth it to come for a cocktail.";3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

We have worked a handful of weddings at ritzy hotels, and we had great expectations for the drake. However, all the vendors were given a room (the one room without any camera) that we were told would be safe. Towards the end of the night, an iphone goes missing as well as a good chunk of money. We find that our wallets had been opened and were on top of our bags. TALK about feeling violated. This has never ever happened to us before. Guests had no access to the room and we had seen a man in the drake uniform walk in and quickly walk out of the room. It was obviously one of the drake employees, I'm sure they are pretty aware of the fact that they had no cameras in that particular room. Also, the worst part is that when we complained all they did was ""file a report"" and when asked if this has ever happened before the security officer replied ""not really""....what do you mean not really? How disgusting! To make things even worse, he removed himself from taking responsibility of the situation by saying they hire a lot of their staff to work larger events, just sort of freelanced..he made it seem like they hired people off the streets /// do they even do background checks on who they hire? Guests pay A LOT of money for these rooms and I wonder if anything has ever been stolen from the rooms. It is appalling that nothing was done, we weren't reimbursed. They didn't even take the initiative to look into the cameras in the hallway at least to see if anyone had walked in and out of the rooms.

Also keep in mind that if your in a room with the floor to ceiling windows, the condos across state street will also have full view of your showering activities and binoculars would not be necessary, it's close enough that you could almost have a conversation with someone if you knew sign language or could read lips.  I was in a corner suite and the neighboring buildings on the other side were about a block away so at least I could have the shades open and not feel like I was giving somebody a show unless of course I forgot to pull the strange sliding closet door shut.   Someone else commented on noise in their review, I didn't make any myself, but I did hear a couple somewhere on my floor partaking in extracurricular activities, mid-afternoon mind you, and it sounded like they were trying to kill each other.  I seriously thought somebody was in pain and thought about calling the front desk.  I don't know if it was the all glass aspect of the place, but noise travels in this building so if this is what you intend to come to this place for, keep in mind you will be heard by everybody on the floor. I had to blast the heat because it was winter and had all that glass, and I suspect cooling the room would be an issue in the summer, but I was still very comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, wifi worked like a charm, and the mini-bar came in handy, just be prepared to not have much room if you bring your own provisions, it was so packed in that one of the wine bottles fell out onto the hardwood floor, fortunately it didn't break. I used the steam room in the ""spa"", but was disappointed at the lack of a sauna, I never did see the fitness center and not sure there even was one.  I did not use room service, the staff of the hotel was accomodating and professional, I found the desk clerks to be a little too stiff, but nothing terrible, I'm just used to Hilton and Hyatt and wanted to try out a boutique hotel for a change of pace.  As a construction worker I felt pretty out of place, you would definitely feel at home if your a Rock Star or some other artsy fartsy type though. Bottom line, I think this sort of place is fine for honeymooners that can't stand to be apart for five minutes, hence the always visible toilet/shower.  And it's probably ok for singles such as myself too, but families and groups or businesspeople trying to save money and doubling up, you're in for some awkward moments.";4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

We wanted to take it home along with the bedding. *Big flat tv, Keurig machine with coffee and tea cartridge, affordable mini bar, ipod/iphone player, alarm clock, office desk. *Bathroom necessities always plentiful.

Close to restaurants, transit stops, theater, etc. *They kept our baggage in storage for the last few hours we were in Chicago to sightsee! That was very helpful of them. *Housekeeping was very attentive and when there was a request.. they were right behind it. *Free use of the in room safe was definitely a reassurance. *We were staying on the 14th floor which didn't seem to hear the reminants of the Friday and Saturday night partying up on the roof, any further up I would reconsider, but the hotel front desk are really conscious of it at the time of booking. Cons. There were a couple of mis-design, but nothing too major. *In the first room, 11th floor (no floor to ceiling windows, but it did have a balcony), there was a shower door that leaked into the bathroom.. there was a good half an inch space between the door and the wall. We were switched into the comfy king due to personal request, we were situated into an upgrade of a room located on the 14th floor -which was excellent. *I particularly did not like the fact that there was not an entrance solely for Vertigo. The bar patrons were using the same elevators as guest who were staying at the hotel. Could be a security flaw, but we weren't particularly bothered but you never know. *The walls are thin, but it didn't seem to bother us at all. *The city sounds were serene to us, but for some could be bothersome. *The window blinds would be one solitary blind as opposed to three different un-overlapping blind that would let sun through.. not good for those that only sleep in complete darkness.

Let's do the math: Upon arrival I was greeted by the always friendly door men at the entrance (+1), and then waited and rode one floor up in an elevator to the lobby (-1) where I was summarily ignored by the two people sitting at reception. After attempting to use the strange computer kiosk check-in I finally flagged down someone to help get me my key (-1). This person was openly rude and disparaging to me for no particular reason, spending five minutes lecturing me on how not to book a room through Expedia - note that I was not the person who booked the room. This became an even larger problem when, despite taking both my ID, credit card and a signed form - they booked me into Colleen's room (-1). I'll let her explain the appalling shit storm that ensued after this mistake but needless to say, they need to hire hospitality staff and problem solvers, not petty people who hate their jobs.   The room itself was tiny and dark, the only natural sunlight came from a door to a small balcony (-1). I'm a sucker for balconies (+1). While that shower head could bring world peace with the perfect rain of water that flows out of it (+1), the shower itself was cramped and the complimentary toiletries seemed cheap (-1). But they did provide plenty of towels, cotton swabs, q-tips and a strong hair dryer so I just used the products I packed and went on my merry way (+1). The bed was comfortable (+1) and room service came fast and fresh (+1). Stay away from the in room snacks, despite looking tasty and locally sourced, they are old and stale. All of them. But the mini bar prices are super reasonable so I know you'll be tempted. Overall, it was decent. There were a lot of flaws but it was a comfortable place to stay and certainly not grimy or crappy in any way. Just a lot of smaller details and customer service issues that they could improve on.

This places me in the unique position of seeing the entire ebb and tide of customers and the manner in which the team at Dana served them. The Quickie Review: AMAZING. Absolute Fabulocity. Danalicious. Book 'Em Dana. Wow. The Detailed Review: I'd like to start off by disclosing that I travel way too much for work. Like up to 100 nights a year in hotels much kinda much. I have stayed in hotels that are much  more expensive than Dana and ones much less expensive. So at the high-end of this spectrum we are talking Bellagio suite and at the low end Embassy Suites. (each a fine player in their market) Of ANY hotel I have ever visited, Dana is simply the best experience ever. Hands down. I have to admit that I read the less than favorable reviews first because I knew pretty much what the huge number of  the 4+ Star crowd reviews would say already.  Of the few negative reviews, I tossed out about 50% for the guest just being whiny or unrealistic. For example, one reviewer was a classic example of an all around 'all about me' classic bitch about her stroller issue. NEWSFLASH Princess: You are in River North...basically down freakin town Chicago. This ain't West Goatscrew, Nebraska. It's a stylish neighborhood in a densely populated urban area with a demographic that is largely single, trendy, well-dressed and still a size six. No matter the demographics, any idiot knows that this - and many other neighborhoods close to downtown - are totally stroller inappropriate. In fact, it was quite rude of you not only to bring one but to expect special treatment for using one. It ain't all about you. There. Wha??? Somebody had to say it. You know you wanted to. Yes, the elavators are slow on busy days and nights. A bit of a design flaw. But if it takes me an additional 5 minutes of my day to get to heaven then I'm still in heaven. Yea me. As for the elevator to the elevator design...oh good LAWD (have mercy) we're talking ONE FLOOR in a sparsely used glass box of bliss. Really honey..it adds like 2 minutes tops to your journey towards Valhalla. You can also use this brilliant invention called 'the staircase' which is even stylishly staggered just for your personal comfort. This adds about 15 seconds tops to your journey. Woo. You carried the thing for 9 months and now reject it for 2 minutes work? Way to go Mommy Dearest. The smart money is on Dana. For the prices, the professionalism of the staff, the thoughtful amenities provided and the kickass location. Perfection.  Honestly, you don't see this type of total package at this price level. Add 200 more per night and it's common. It's expected. At Dana, it's just another reason to fall in love with the subtle and not so subtle ways they work to make your visit special. There is a door to the bathroom; you ARE NOT exposed in the shower. If standing in front of the opening into the  bathroom, Look just to either side for some highly polished wood. Now touch the wood and SLIDE It either right or left to maintain bathroom privacy and reveal your closet and safe. The showers are to die for. Oh if mine could talk. (zip it!)  Thankfully what happened at Dana stays with the doorman. (TIP them people...they deserve it and are your best source of info in the city. And darn nice people too.) Staff is brilliant. Never had an issue. I've watched them when slow and when slammed. In every situation,  I witnessed polished professionalism and grace. Sure, there may be some moments that some visitors have where something went wrong. Every hotel has that reality. Dana just handles it better; I can almost guarantee that based on seeing them in action day to day. Rooms rock. Beds are like sleeping on a dreamy cloud made of porn. Wonderful. The day I moved to my new house I actually shed a tear in leaving Dana. I've even gone back for a weekend just to see my muse. 6 Months later she still remembered my name. Class act guys.

1884;3/5/2012;zPLHbiyg1I-xFaq4T1s8Lw;Bf0feidGvk-Q4wHdrUODrw;"I celebrated my 30th birthday here and spent about $2,000 with the hotel. I booked a large suite, 6 appointments to in room spa service ($150 per service), Dinner at their restaurant aja for 12, and $1000 worth of bottle service at their club (Vertigo). Everything was totally mismanaged and disorganized. None of there services (spa, restaurant, hotel) communicate with each other. Nothing coordinated properly. However, most of the staff was friendly and they tried to be accommodating, but just could not figure it out. I forgave them for this. However, I could not forgive them for the following events: I had a small group of friends meet me at my suite around 9:30 on a Saturday night before bottle service at Vertigo. Our party was fairly conservative. Friends actually told me they thought the party was at a room across from mine, because they saw tons of people pile in and loud music. Given that at least three other rooms on my floor were raging, I figured my party was pretty tame. At about 10:45, just as we were about to go up to Vertigo, my friends decided to sing me Happy Birthday and make a toast to me. I was so touched, but I could not enjoy it because as soon as they finished two very irate and intimidating security men barged into my room and escorted me to the hallway. My boyfriend followed me out because he was concerned for my safety. The two men bullied him back in the room stating that they would physically remove him if he continued to follow me. One security man yelled at me for having people in the room while the other one stared at my body. I asked the security man to please stop yelling at me and that I planned to escort my guests to Vertigo where my $1000 table waited for me. All the while, I was being visually raped by the other security guy. So then after much embarrassment, I asked my guests to follow me to the lounge upstairs. Instead of getting the VIP treatment that Vertigo promised me, my guests were made to leave the hotel, go around to the other side in the cold and wait in line. I talked to the bouncer and told him I had bottle service. He refused to let me up to the club and refused to let my friends in. So, I bribed him with $40 to let me and my friends up to my $1000 table. He obliged me after the bribe. Once I got to my table, my waitress and hostess were actually really nice and accommodating. I had no problem tipping them an extra $100. However, the remainder of my late arriving guests were repeatedly harassed by the hotel management and security. Several of my male gay friends were forced to wait outside as women passed them to get in. After my really fun party at Vertigo I decided to go back to my room. The parties were raging hard  at other rooms on my floor. I just wanted to chill with a few of my close friends. We were sitting on the couch, eating, and talking. No music was playing nor were we talking loudly. In fact, we could hear the party going on next door from our room. 10 minutes later 3 aggressive security men barge into my room. They begin to yell at my guests and tell them to ""get the f%#k out"" of my room. The man whom I bribed with the $40 was the only nice one (I wonder why). Even though there were about 12 people in the room earlier for my spa service with no problems, the security guard commanded that only 4 people could be in the room. Shaken and crying by this point, I told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home. He calmed me down and said we should just get some sleep. So, Dana Hotel basically ruined my 30th birthday and took all my money.";1;10;0;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Aside from the wardrobe no-nos, the hotel rooms are very clean and the beds are super comfortable.  The only other odd thing was the shower--the inside of the shower was very spacious and had a waterfall faucet along with a handheld faucet, but instead of a wall, there was a huge piece of glass so the person showering could be seen from the bedroom side of the hotel room.  These rooms are definitely good for those who are looking to get a little frisky, but there is a curtain for those that like their privacy while showering. Overall, we had a great experience here and hopefully I'll be able to return someday!";4;1;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

One complaint, they don't have HBO, so we settled on Showtime since the MMA fights were on and boyfriend loves that. Shower was amazing, staff was very friendly and helpful.

This swanky hotel felt like more of an apartment then a hotel... most of the time anyways. I mean except for the awesome shower, the chocolate covered fortune cookie from housekeeping, the welcome *insert name here* on the television upon checking in, and the breathtaking floor-to-ceiling windows it did feel like I was staying over at a friend's place that happened to live in the city. The room had a studio loft feel and I love the glass in the shower to help open the space up and connect the rooms more. Location is key. Dana has your key... maybe not to your heart but definitely to the heart of the city. The red line is 2 blocks away, yummy eats are all around, and Michigan Ave. is a short stroll down the street. The bar at the top of the building is really cozy and offers decent views of the city the best of which can be taken in at night. The big downfall is that the bar is closed to only hotel guests so you don't really get to talk to any locals and get to know the people that make the city what it is. Breakfast on the first floor however is a much different story. Awesome food to get your day going and on both days that we stayed got to talk to some really great people over morning coffee. I would have given 5 stars for the place alone but the people at the front desk just really irked me. They were the only people there that had a stick up their arse. Different shifts = different people with the same stick. I don't know what all their problems were but I didn't come across one friendly person working that position my whole stay. You are the frontline employee to the customer experience... act like it. *Overall Dana, if you were a person, I see you in stilettos. Like really fashionable ones but ones that you got on a super deal at DSW or something. You're that girl that is cool without trying and everyone hates you because they want to be you but they can't hate you because you're so likeable. Even with the horrible front desk staff, the rest of the people make up for their downfall. Very reasonably priced and very good location. Rating: 4";4;3;2;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Even in our home city, we've stayed in nearly all of the higher end hotels for ""stay-cations."" While the Dana has a great location and very nice rooms, it's only drawback is that it's starting to show a little bit of wear and tear around the edges. Little scuffs and nicks are easy to clean up by maintenance staff, but really go a long way to keeping the hotel looking ""nice and new."" I love the fact that they have little bags of goodies on the nightstand for mini bar treats. Most hotels offer the same stiff and boring goodies, pretzels...mix nuts...cookies...BLAH! Forget that! The Dana has gummy bears, chocolate covered dried fruit, chocolate covered cookies, toffee squares...you name it! YUM! The shower was also one of my favorite features, it's glass wall faces the bed.

The rooms are very spacious and I especially loved the hardwood floors and rain shower surrounded by glass doors on all sides (there is a curtain to shield yourself from peeping toms). Business travelers will also be thrilled to know the wifi is fast and free...and this hotel just happens to be located in a very convenient downtown location. If you get hungry Ajasteak is right downstairs and there's plenty of other good eats (quartino is always a winner) within a block of the hotel. My colleague found this room on http://quickbook.com for just over $200, which I thought was quite the deal for a quality hotel during summer in Chicago.  She seemed quite happy with her 3 nights in the hotel as well, her only complaint being that the walls were super thin so you can hear everything in the neighboring hotel rooms.

When I made my reservations, I asked for my exact room I had during my last stay. I was on the 20-somethingth floor with great views and off to the corner--far from the elevator. Unfortch, they did me a solid during my last stay and gave me that room at our corporate rate (it's usually more for a corner room). I didn't have that option this time ... until I worked my charm, and the reservation specialist over the phone went ahead and gave me that corner room for the same rate. I love you Dana Hotel &amp; Spa. Nothing much changed from my last stay: it's still a challenge to get out of those marshmellow-ey, sleep-like-a-baby beds. The shower is heaven; bath products are spa-like ... Only change I noticed was the complimentary breakfast. It used to be laid out on the bar buffet-style, but now you have to go to the restaurant for a sit-down meal. You can still grab and go, but when you're in a hurry, it takes a bit longer. My only complaint is the loud AC. It rattles around when it shuts on and off ... and I do wish the rooms had a fans. When the air is on auto and blows for however long, the room is a nice crisp cold and lying under the covers in bliss. But as soon as it auto-powers off for a bit, the room gets HOT. A fan would keep that cool air circulating for the time being. Just a thought. Other than that, service is five stars; they have some of the friendliest doormen ever.";4;10;5;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

The room was fantastic--incredibly spacious, unique views of downtown, and a minimalist aesthetic that we enjoyed. The living area of the suite has a pretty large mini fridge, couch, and coffee table, so it was a nice spot to relax and have a bottle of wine before dinner. The bathroom was incredible--I am still dreaming about the double rain shower! I can't give this place 5 stars though for 2 reasons: 1) the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. I felt like we weren't even sleeping on a mattress, but rather a giant padded pillow. And not in a ""it was so soft"" kind of way. The bed was just incredibly unstructured--lumpy, sagging, not comfortable at all. It was bad enough that I wouldn't be willing to pay full price for a room here, and especially wouldn't be willing to stay more than one night. I'm not really picky about beds, but there was just something wrong with this one (my fiance agreed). I haven't noticed any other complaints about this though, was ours just defective?? 2) We didn't interact with the concierge much, but it seemed like the staff could be a bit absentee. I don't really care about luxury service or anything, but if you're the kind of person that does, I could envision this place not being attentive enough for you.

It's boutique-y in feel and they have a nice rain shower in the bathroom that has floor to ceiling glass that overlooks the sleeping and lounge area. The bed has plenty of pillows and is quite comfortable. The rooms are equipped with flat screens, and they have nice bath products. During my first trip, I was consistently having to have my key re-magnetized. Apparently cell phones and credit cards cause the key to malfunction. Unless I was wearing pants with pockets, and I could store the key separately in my pocket, there ws about a 60 percent chance that I'd have issues with it. The second time, I still happy with my stay, but the key issue really began to wear on me. If I weren't going in and out of my room more than once a day, maybe this wouldn't have pissed me off. About every 3 times I had to get my key re-magnetized. And I wasn't alone. Seemed to be quite a trend here. The worst was when you were in the elevator with a bunch of people who keyed the elevator so you could push your floor button, only to realize that your room key didn't work once again when you reach your room. On weekends, it's also a pain in the ass because the elevator is shared with the rooftop lounge and there are loads of drunk people you have to ride with, some who like to push all the buttons ""for fun"".

Like scrunch up your face and make a noise strong. If you're gonna pay $10+ for a drink in my book, it better be strong. Sangria was tasty. 3) I dug the décor.

The most irritating things was having to use my room key to GO UP and DOWN the elevator. YUP, in case of emergency, don't use the elevator, because it won't go anywhere without a room key. This was always the talk on the elevator with someone, and an annoyance during my stay there. The location is good, very close to two Starbucks and one block away from Whole Foods. The staff is great, always good-looking, friendly and helpful. I didn't experience much noise, but that was probably because my room was on the end of the hall.

I would recommend it to people who are night owls, want to party,, meet other singles, and who don't mind keying up and down the elevator.";3;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1917;5/19/2010;D;-r7gJoqV1uaHHOoHkhUGrQ;"My boyfriend and I spent this past weekend at the Dana hotel and had the most fabulous time ever! He flew in from Ohio and I flew in from California, and this was my first time visiting chicago, so it was important that we got a little taste of everything. Terrific location first of all, within walking distance of shopping, restaurants/bars. Loved the fashionable, modern vibe the hotel had going on. Room was very clean, beds were sooo comfortable and the shower was huge! Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to check out the spa. Drew, the bartender at the main lobby bar kept us coming back every night! He had an awesome personality, kept us entertained at the bar, hooked us up with some amazing drinks, and recommended some great places for us to go out and to eat! Rooftop bar was nice as well, very cool concept and great views, more of a relaxed setting as well. The bellman, Caesar was also of great help to us from the minute we arrived at the hotel by assisting us with our luggage to providing us with directions every time we needed to get somewhere! Overall, the service at Dana was great, and the hotel was just what we were looking for! :)";5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1918;6/4/2009;Qs7RMRn8uPsFDVkAqtUNxQ;0zRLjgw0PQUwqiUCOIgShQ;"Ah, Dana Hotel, home sweet home for a few days. Overall, I'm most certainly a fan, but with a few caveats or odd design things that I wish someone had thought about (maybe they did?) in the design of the rooms. Pluses: + Clean and modern decor that still didn't feel sterile or cold. + Turn-down service with chocolate-covered fortune cookies (...and they filled my ice bucket, too?!  Is that normal or did someone think I was going to have a party in my room?!) + Big comfy beds with smooshy comforters + Cool iPod docking stations with pretty great quality speakers + Flat-screen TVs with non-confusing remotes + Exceedingly friendly and helpful staff + A nice hotel bar on the ground floor + 24 hr room service was available if you needed it (though there is a 7-11 located across the street if you are looking for cheaper late-night snacks). +Free wifi +Mini-business center with 2 computers and a printer +Great towels!  I don't know why this should be such a big deal, but it IS.  sometimes even the nicest hotel have those super-scratchy small-ish towels.  These were bath-sheet size and so soft you wanted to nuzzle 'em. Minuses/Funny things: - No matter how many hotels do this, I still find it slightly jarring to check in on the 2nd floor -- although the 2 elevator system was a little wacky, that probably does help narrow down on the confusion, though... - The rainwater shower was cool, but it was also.... literally, cool. Because there's no way to close off the shower from the rest of the bathroom (there's just a partial class divider), it can feel a lil' drafty -The walls seem pretty thin. The funny part is that one of the loudest recurrent noises you might notice is that of the neighbor's curtains going up or down.  Considering that the walls are all glass, this is bound to happen pretty often! Also...ask for a room way from the elevator, for sure. Otherwise, you may be hearing lots of ""ding, ding, ding"" while trying to sleep. - Because of the walls of glass and the way the shower and bathroom are set up, you'll need to close at least one set of curtains before showering or using the bathroom. It's a little odd to think that if someone didn't notice that, they would immediately be exposing themself in multiple vulnerable states. I didn't get to visit the upstairs bar/lounge, but wish I'd had a chance. I also would have liked to try a spa service or two but alas, I'm trying to save a little money.   Considering my overall experience, I'd be happy to stay here again next time I'm in Chicago (and not staying with friends or family) and hopefully check it out, along with a massage, perhaps!";4;8;5;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1920;6/14/2009;P4D;yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ;"So I got pretty lucky and won a Time Out weekly prize - I got a free night at the Dana, and a free ""couple's spa package"" for my boyfriend and myself! The concierge was extremely friendly and accommodating.  For some reason, when I had selected my room type, I had chosen a room with two double beds even though I was staying with my boyfriend.  it was a lapse in judgment.  Fortunately, the woman at the desk noticed and was like ""Why would a couple have a room with two double beds?"" and updated us to a corner king room!  She really was interested in making our stay the best it could be, and that did not go unnoticed. I thought the room was beautiful.  The bed was cozy and overflowing with pillows.  Two walls were made entirely of windows, but the shades that pull down are very effective at blocking early-morning sunshine.  It was nice to have a view down State Street.  I don't think the people on the ground can see us up on the 6th floor, but I felt a bit weird changing my clothes in full, broad daylight next to a window, but nobody seemed to look up.  Hopefully! The bathroom was pretty awesome as well - the one downside was the sliding door.  Lots of boutique hotels seem to have these, and I hate them.  they don't block sound, and you just feel like whoever you're sharing the room with can hear all your business.  Uncool.  Also our sliding door had some trouble staying shut, which made it even worse....  BUT I loved the shower!  It was like being in a rain forest!  Once we figured out how to work out, it was divine - one of the shower heads is directly overhead so it pours down on you like rain, and the other has a detachable head and strong water pressure.  There was no shower curtain or door, which was kinda weird, but also kind of hot.  It gives you a direct view of yourself (and your shower buddy, if you have one) in the mirror, so shy people may feel a bit awkward.  I loved it.  It was very luxurious. The one weird thing about the room was that the ceiling and one pillar looked sort of....unfinished.  They were just that gray stone/cement color, with what looked like water spots and paint splatters.  It looked like somebody forgot to finish painting the room.  If it was meant to be part of the aesthetic, it was lost on me.  However, when we turned the lights off, the light coming from the street peeked through the cracks in the window shades, and made this amazing light pattern on the ceiling.  I can't tell if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty lovely.  There were lots of other nice things about the room - the huge mirror, the modern coffeemaker, and the general decor were all nice touches. Morning room service was prompt - the price is what you'd expect, but the food was surprisingly tasty.  For some reason, the room service menu in our room was apparently ""outdated,"" so the items we ordered were no longer on the breakfast menu.  Still, the guy on the phone told us to describe the items and the kitchen would be happy to make them anyway.  I dig that. We also spent several hours at the spa getting our couple's package!  Massages were first, and they were great.  The couples massage entailed my boyfriend and I lying in separate beds while two women worked on us.  The room was dim, and there were candles and soft music.  The women were professional and talented - I'd recommend it to anybody who doesn't mind letting another woman put her hands on their man.  Ha.  Facials were next - I'd only had one before in my life, so I don't have much to judge it against.  It felt good - the bed was heated and the woman explained everything to me as she went along.  She gave me some advice on how to better care for my skin - and I know I don't do much for it, so I needed the help. She did some extractions using her hands, which surprised me, but I didn't mind.  As long as it works!  My skin did feel soft and glowing afterwards, maybe now I'll start taking better care of it to keep it that way.  The mani/pedi was next.  I loved the woman who did it - her name was Joyce - but the setting was odd.  She didn't really have her own room - just a little back area in a corridor behind the spa desk.  It was a little cramped, and it wasn't really a room, so we could hear all the chatter up at the spa desk the whole time.  The nail polish selection was good colorwise, but I think it was cheap polish - I prefer something like OPI for this kind of thing.  Regardless, Joyce was lovely and totally hilarious.  She moved back and forth between my boyfriend and I, and we really enjoyed her personality.  I have certainly had more luxurious mani/pedis in my life, but she still did a very nice job.  I think she could've done more with sloughing off dry skin - this was my first pedi since winter ended and I wanted some more intensive work!  The other nice thing was the ""relaxation room"" they put us in between treatments.  It's dim and quiet, with ice water to drink and lots of soft chairs and daybeds to lounge on.";4;2;2;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1921;8/4/2010;v7kgVczSgAakBkshFQ0kDg;3CCCOFUm1eZET-g17qd7wg;"Let me start with a little info:  I've stayed in several Chicago hotels, and this is BY FAR the only hotel where I've actually enjoyed coming back to the room.  This was my 10th wedding anniversary, and I Yelp-stalked several hotels looking for spots that were not just template rooms.  Also, we didn't try the Spa service on this trip. LOCATION: Very nicely situated; the walk to Michigan Ave was drama-less, as was a quick 15-minute jaunt to Morton's off Wacker, and we also had a need to take the El from Northwestern University (Davis Station) to the Chicago Station, and the Dana is wonderfully placed right between that and the Grand Station, 2-3 blocks in either direction. I felt like everything that was important was no more than a 15-minute walk away (except Navy Pier, which was a $8 cab ride because of ""Transformers 3"" movie set road closures....grrr). STAFF: Courteous and professional throughout the stay. Some places you come across apathetic housekeeping, or the front-desk person who's so busy telling a bar story to the other front-desk person that they jack up your reservation, but the Dana staff was extremely attentive. The Concierge was excellent; he didn't just give us the ""take a cab here and get outta my face"" directions, he took the time to offer alternate routes and transportation methods. ROOM: As soon as I opened the door my jaw hit the ground...and bumped into my wife's jaw.....the views are INCREDIBLE. We had a ""Corner King"" on the 20th floor, which gave us a King bed with two entire walls made of floor-to-ceiling windows. Truly a difference maker, I thoroughly enjoyed the view.  The shower was pretty-good, I like the overhead rain-shower thingy, and the bathroom itself was styled well with good ergonomics for the most part. ATTACHED RESTAURANT & PARTY JOINT: The Dana provided us with two $10 breakfast vouchers for the ""Aja"" restaurant on the ground floor, which was cool, but you'd be better-served by walking the few blocks to ""Yolk"" for breakfast (FIVE STARS for Yolk, by the way....). We didn't have dinner at ""Aja"".  There's a pre-party, or lounge bar, or whatever type place on the roof, I forgot the name, but my wife and I tried it one night for a few minutes and we just weren't feeling the atmosphere. Could be that we're fuddy-duddies, but with the deck being closed at that time the only thing to do was drink and listen to somebody's half-assed attempt at techno. GRIPES: Other than ""Aja"" and the lounge, the gripes are very minor. Of course, with the great view out...comes a great view in. There's an apartment building directly across the street and there were a few awkward moments where my eyes met the tenants in a few apartments, but if you don't have a problem being ""seen"", it's not a biggie, just be aware. Also, there were 7 windows...which means there are 7 blackout shades AND 7 separate occluded shades. The most tiresome part was coming back to the room and finding that ALL of the shades had been let down as part of the turn-down service. Minor irritant, but again, just be ready to work to get a night view. The shower has a glass wall where a person in the room can see in the shower...and directly through the shower to someone on the crapper. There's a curtain, but it's on the room side. Made for ""hilarious"" moments for my wife while I was in my ""Thinker"" position. Last minor irritant, the shower doesn't have a door, it has a glass half-partition, so if you're a sloppy shower-er, count on having a wet bathroom floor. Almost forgot about the elevators: There's two of them; one from the ground floor to the check-in lobby (one floor up....), and a completely separate elevator from the check-in lobby to the rooms. The chafing part of this is that the room elevator actually DOES go to the ground floor, but it appears to be used only for vetting the crowd for the lounge. Yet another strike against the lounge....lol....it's no big deal though, I'm just nit-picking at this point..... That's it until my next visit, because I will definitely be staying there again. This is a well placed hotel with a twist and a great staff, and I really liked it.";4;1;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1925;1/3/2010;q5SCapDisUdgJS6x70CL6g;REwTpmdBFaYKRDgt-kqrwg;"My honey took me here for a romantic staycation weekend for my birthday.  I had no idea we were going there and hadn't heard too much about the hotel so had no expectations.  I did however read a few yelp reviews while we were there watching our romantic weekend go down the tubes because of horrible service, incredible noise, and snotty, huffy hotel staff. So I'll start with arrival - everything went fine, we get to the room and at first are ohhhing and ahhing over the very cool looking shower.  But after taking a shower, the coolness factor wears off - serious open door design flaw. So not too much of a big deal, but worth noting.  Then we went for drinks in their super swanky rooftop lounge.  That was fun (although crazy overpriced) but I guess what do you expect from a downtown hotel.  The appetizers we had were decent and the service was a little slow. Also, you couldn't get to the rooftop lounge unless you went back downstairs and had someone swipe a card to get you up there.  This seemed kind of ridiculous to me - I had a room key, that should work as well.  We go out to dinner, get back to the room and when we're trying to go to sleep the noise from the rooftop bar is unimaginably loud. I can pretty much sleep though anything but this was out of control.  So we called the front desk to see if we could be transferred to another room (even though we were exhausted and already in bed). The woman on the phone was completely rude and unaccomidating.  She said the rooms were completely booked (really? In a recession on an off weekend right before a holiday?) and there was nothing she could do.  She did say she would ""send somebody up."" So we stayed awake waiting to speak with this person she was sending up and they never showed.  We called again.  Same woman said that she sent security up to our floor to walk the hallways and see if this was noise.  Since they didn't hear anything (in the hallway) then she said there was no problem with noise.  I asked if there was anything she could do, that we couldn't sleep and she said she could send up a fan or earplugs. (which then took 30 mins to get to our room and didn't help much.) The next morning after a crappy nights sleep (oh and there were multiple holes in the sheets) we ventured downstairs for breakfast. We wouldn't have even eaten there (read the reviews before hand that indicated the service was TERRIBLE and the food mediocre) but we had vouchers. We get to the restaurant and decide to sit at the bar because we thought we'd have a better chance at getting better service. I think that was a good call and while we were waiting for our food we got to see how frantic, disorganized and unprofessional the management and some of the waitstaff were who were trying to get drinks to their table.  Food came out - utterly unforgettable, greasy, and not worth even using the voucher.   Finally we go to leave and as we're checking out the manager just tells us we're all set after we turn in the keys (they didn't even ask how our stay was.) So I pipe up and give him an earful in a respectful way but in front of many other guests. he kind of half apologizes and then says he'll follow up in the next 24 hours by calling me to get more information and see if there's anything more they can do. It's now been 2 months and no call ever came.   Do yourself a favor, if you are going to stay at a nice hotel in Chicago, skip the Dana.";1;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Also, the see through shower to the toilet is definitely for the adventurous. 3) Most of the staff was great.....friendly, helpful, and curteous.  Only one douche works there, and unfortunately he was working the front desk on my visit.

1927;4/30/2010;ACNOpvLnaQ9y6k500tclFQ;gNuwpyT9iwL2Np6AUlTaUQ;"This is a very chic and unique hotel. There are definite pros and cons. Pros: if you book through the hotel you get breakfast vouchers and even if you find a better deal on any online site they will match the price and maybe even upgrade your room. The restaurant had a very good breakfast menu, everything we got tasted great! We got a comfy King room corner view. It is amazing! The ceiling to floor windows are very unique. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings with the adjacent buildings. Keeping your shades up or down when needed. You'll have a great night view too. The floors are  half wood and carpet which gives it a homey feel. Shower is awesome! Very chic room overall. All the staff are very attentive and friendly. The concierge helped me surprise my husband with chocolate covered strawberries and a nice bottle of champagne delivered to our room for his birthday. Cons: you hear sirens all day and night!! If you're a light sleeper this is quite annoying. But I guess that's what you get visiting a big city. It's definitely worse than NYC. The walls are a little thin of the room but not bad.

1928;8/18/2010;2605xxsiGmLs8Or;7TfVV64bpESXSalEuVQurw;"I'm going to keep this brief, yeah right. The good: they allowed us to check-in early without waiting (we got in around 11am). The doorman was awesome. Basically, this place was pretty cool as long as you didn't go inside. The bad: THE SPA. Let me go ahead and go into detail about their spa... upon check in, the fiance and I perused their spa menu, and after deciding on a couples massage (with two separate techniques) I gave the spa a call. It was a Friday, so when the receptionist told me their were no 80 minute couple slots left, it wasn't a surprise. Besides, they rave about their spa so it was sort of expected. Naturally, I asked about 80 minute slots for the next day and the employee told me they had an opening, so I took it. Fast forward to the appointment... the floor in the ladies locker-room was slippery so I fell walking out. And slipped walking back in (needless to say I couldn't walk the next day... now I wish I would have filed a complaint). Our appt was for something like 1pm, so we got their early to fill out paperwork and when 1pm rolled around we were taken to the small ""relaxation room."" 1:10 rolls around and two girls get us for our massages. Mind you, no one up until this point has asked us what style of massage we were receiving... we got what they wanted to give. The massage was good, a little disappointing considering I had asked for the ""dana's aromasoul massages"" and what I got instead felt like a sports rub. Well then 40 minutes came up and the girls said their goodbyes. I knew it was too fast for 80 minutes so we asked the front desk and they told us it was a 50 minute massage. Sure, a 50 minute massage and that is why we are sitting in the lobby, DRESSED, talking to you about it and it isn't even 2PM! I was fit to be tied (and massaged a little longer too) but we went to our room and I called the spa back. Finally a manager got on the line, told me they weren't ANY 80 minute slots available when I made my appt the day before and then offered to refund 15%. I told him, first off: apologize. When I call to book an 80 minute couples massage and there are only 50 min slots available: TELL ME. Don't be a retard and book me... that is BS. Second of all: don't insult me with a refund of 15%. Fool. I paid for services rendered. If you are going to go the lame-refund route, refund 100%. In the end, they left a bag of trial skin products on my door knob with $28 with a note saying: 15% refund. FAIL. Now onto the rest of the bad: the staff working in the restaurant ""area"" are completely and utterly confused. We asked where the hostess stand was.. the reply ""um, just stand right here."" Another time we asked the sushi bar if they were serving (at the sushi bar), they said yes. We sit down and 3 minutes later they tell us the sushi bar is closed but we can order sushi from downstairs. So, we sit at a table (this is on that same Saturday before the awesome spa debacle) downstairs and ask for the sushi menu. ""No, we don't serve sushi, only brunch."" Okay, well homeboy 10 steps up said you did. So Mr. Server goes upstairs and comes back no later then 10 minutes and says they can do it. Ordered an iced tea and the guy told me the bartender had to make it. HA!  This place is unreal! That Saturday night there were people screaming until 7am and you could hear them on the 8th floor. No joke. I slept with a pillow over my head which brings me to the next part... We stayed in the ""Tranquil suite"" and it was no where near tranquil considering the maids closet was adjacent to it. SO fail. We brought it to the attention of the employee at the front desk upon checking out and all he said was ""oh yeah, I've heard that before."" Seriously? Oh yeah, their iron ruined a recently purchased shirt... lol, I really don't know how I didn't go apeshit on these people. There were random hoodlums in the elevators waiting for someone with a card to get in. As a girl, this made me feel miles away from safe. Especially when it is later in the evening and I happen to be by myself. We reserved via the website and the site decided it wanted to upgrade our room (after the online checkout) to a MUCH more expensive suite (almost 1k more), so we had issues getting things right a month before we made it to Chicago. This place is so awesome. /sarcasm";1;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1936;2/15/2010;g7RpYT9xRyGPX8;_Z26akmA0QbbUKBCt-cLuQ;"We booked a tranquil suite at the Dana for 3 nights last week for our 9 year anniversary and were very pleased.  The room itself was amazing, on the 21st floor, with 2 separate balconies showcasing 2 different views.  The shower was unlike anything I'd ever seen, with the beautiful tile and slate floors, and the incredible rain shower heads.  The lighting in the bathroom was also amazing and I really appreciated the magnified handheld mirror.  The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby.  Also the round chair in the ""living room"" was so comfortable that I wanted to take it home! We got a couple's harmony massage in the spa, and they were very nice.  Different than other massages we'd had, but still relaxing.  Our  massage therapists Cat and Nicole were very skilled. We had dinner at Aja and Ami, our waiter,  was very accomodating.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  In fact, all of the food, including everything in the honor bar (wine, beer, water, soda, snacks) was very reasonably priced.  They provided us with $15 breakfast coupons for each day, but we never got out of the comfy bed in time to partake.  However, we did order breakfast from the room service menu and the food was very good and also reasonably priced. We went to the bar at Aja all 3 nights and each night our bartenders were very friendly and kept the conversation flowing. Being tattoo collectors, we appreciated the fact that most every staff member in the bar/restaurant had tattoos and we were even told by one bartender that we ""fit in well"" :-)  since we sometimes get sideways glances for our lifestyle choices.   We did venture up to Vertigo, just to see the view, but the whole ""night club"" mentality is not our scene so we didn't stick around.   I give the Dana 5 stars for service and friendliness, but do have to note a few cons on our visit, and these are things that I addressed with the sales marketer (when he asked us) and the concierge: *  the towels are not very soft.   For the price of the room, I expected soft, luxurious towels.  These were pretty scratchy.  The robes were nice, but not near as nice/soft as robes on cruise ships we've been on. *  the paper towels in the spa locker room were those brown paper towels you get in bulk for office buildings.  I expected much more from a luxurious spa. * the Dana goes by the ""Honor bar"" system, which is great, but unfortunately, 2 of the bottles of Voss water that we pulled out of the  wine cooler had obviously been opened and re-filled with tap water, which leads me to believe that housekeeping staff is not really checking appropriately.  Although, I do have to say, when I brought those bottles to the concierge they apologized profusely and brought up 2 fresh bottles (and didn't charge us, but we were honest and paid for them). * finally, the 2 person shower was great, but the 3 body jets coming out of the wall are way too powerful and are actually painful, so we didn't utilize them. Overall, I gave this hotel 5 stars because it was an amazing experience and the service was incredible.  I would highly recommend this hotel to others!";5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Really amazing room.  Amazing.  Ordered the room through a hotel website.  Asked for a corner king with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. What I got was an unasked for upgrade to room 701.  Stunning.  One bedroom, plus a living room, plus two balconies, plus a spa bathroom with dual sinks, and a shower of epic proportions.  The shower was easily bigger than my full bathroom at home.  It had two plate sized rainshower heads.  One was accompanied by a hand shower wand.  The other was paired with 3 aimable heads lined up vertically below said shower head.  The shower also had seating at opposite sides of the room.  When the glass door to the real world was closed, you could turn the heat up and sit sauna like.  It was the best shower experience i've ever had.  It will be my inspiration one day when we move out of our condo and into a house and re do the bathroom.  Truly, succulent goodness.  I guess there was other stuff in the room.  Well priced in room wine bar, with no wine over $25 bucks, save sparkling.  40"" TVs in the bedroom and living room.  Affordable snack bar.  Zeppelin iphone dock in the living room which sounded incredible.  Why 4 stars?  The bed wasn't very supportive.  I like a soft bed, but this one was a little too soft.  And I suppose the point of a hotel should first and foremost be to get a good night's sleep. Not all beds are alike, i'm sure, and we may have just had a dud.

Vertigo is on the 25th floor and we were on the 18th floor. We called the front desk and asked to be moved but were told they were full up and nothing they could do (no apology or anything but attitude). They said they'd send up security to give us ear plugs and they didn't show up until 45 minutes later. There was also this periodic knocking noise in the hallway or in the walls.  Breakfast seating not good, we sat at the bar because we were seated at a huge community table where it appeared people were waiting a while to even order. Staff were running around like their heads were cut off. Food wasn't very good and we had to ask for the usual salt, pepper, cream, etc. that you'd expect from standard service.

I actually brought the towel to the front desk manager to show him and all he said was ""I'm sorry, I will tell housekeeping."" Our blackout shade curtain was broken and stuck in the up position and our bed sank in the middle so we literally rolled towards the middle. Walls were scratched and dirty. They actually forgot to give us a wake up call... something that hotels just never do. It's always something you can rely on. Well, not here. It made us late for an appointment.

The make or break with any hotel room really is the bed and this one was fantastically comfortable with beautiful fine linens. You know, so many hotels have a trendy design aesthetic and decent beds, but what really made this experience supreme was the staff -- they were all young but on their game. Everyone from the clerks at check-in to the room service attendee, to the waiters in the restaurant, to the concierge, to the doormen, to the manicurist, they all just had that special something: a friendly quiet confidence in their manner that made you feel comfortable and taken care of.

Really the only negative was the unprofessional staff. Several times during the stay there was no hot water. Apparently they were having a hot water problem and the engineering staff had no clue what they were doing.  He came into the room, tested out the shower and said, ""you're right there is no hot water and I have no idea why but it should be fixed in a few hours."" The manager who sounded like he was in his 20s, very inarticulate and unhelpful promised a discount for a future stay which never came into fruition. A frustrating experience not having hot water, not being able to shower at your convenience, showering in different hotel rooms and empty promises from unprofessional, incompetent, juvenile staff put a damper on what could have been a perfect experience.

I am never one to complain and I usually make the best of any mediocre or sub par situation, i think trips are what you make them with your attitude, but this hotel was awful for the price. Long story, but we got 2 nights at the hotel from a friend who couldn't make the trip. That being said it was ok since we paid half of what he paid for it. At $170 a night for two people (before taxes/fees), I was appalled by the experience. I have stayed at nicer hotels on Michigan Ave. for cheaper and with better amenities for the price. I can't believe what hotels think they can get away with. We had a double room on the top floor, it was tiny and felt like a dorm. The view was an interior room of the other side of the north tower we were in. There were two beds when clearly in the past this room was made for one bed. The bathroom door wouldn't even open all the way from the bed being in the way. Our room was so hot, it was unbearably uncomfortable. Maybe it is common, but I have been in hundreds of hotels and have never had a room where you couldn't choose between having AC or heat.  I realize this hotel is old (it definitely needs updates) but the entire hotel was set for heat. Our window only opened 2 inches and we had to keep the room door open whenever we were in the room just so we wouldn't be smothered by the temperature. For the cost you think you could get something nice out of it. Asking for a fridge was extra. Internet was $11 a day. Room service was average and overpriced, not available late at night, and are subject to 11% tax, added gratuity, and a delivery charge! I just hate added fees. The mattress and bedding was the cheapest I've experienced at any hotel. You could feel every spring and the linens were scratchy and thin (not that you needed them to stay warm). The website for this hotel is EXTREMELY deceiving!!! It looks like the pictures for this hotel were taken 30 yrs ago. The same could be said about the pictures the hotel features on its postcards, in room service binders, and room keycards. The furniture is not the same even in the lobby. The furnishings and decor do not match the styling or updates made decades ago. Parking was $28 a day. Nuff said.

(They were reasonably clean, though.) The iron in my room leaked badly. When I called the front desk to ask for a new one, the woman wasn't very friendly. I politely explained that I had to leave for a meeting in a few minutes, but still no iron after 30 minutes.

Why would I do all those things? Because there is no way that ANYONE should even consider spending the night at the Congress, it's an insult to both decency and intelligence. Sure it's located on Michigan, sure it's right in front of Grant Park but, the room and the service there would make you think you just checked into a roach motel and, for good reasons; let me count the ways: First, we wanted to stay in a non-smoking room. After traveling to the 7th floor we opened a closed corridor, to get to our non-smoking room, and were hit with the ever teasing smell of marijuana. I don't know if someone had just passed through there smoking it or if someone was getting spliffed-out in one of the rooms but, the smell was so strong that we told one of the maids and she said that she would call security. We entered our room and, thank God, there was no smell in there. Instead... ...we found: mold in the bathroom, funky carpet molding that looked like it had been a termite's nesting ground in the 50's, the wallpaper looked like my 7 year old niece put it up using paper-mache, the bathroom door looked like it had been painted over 100 times since the sixties with bits of paint chiping off revealing the several layers of paint underneath like the Grand Canyon.  There was also NO refrigerador in the room, WTF? Come on, even a Super 8 has that and I won't have to pay 3x as much; this fact really sucked since we had just eaten a deep dish pizza and need someplace to store the left overs. And finally, the bathroom itself...let's just say I've seen and used better gas station stalls than the one at the ""presigious"" Congress Plaza Hotel. But wait, there's more! The room was so crappy that we decided to go downstairs and reduce our stay there to just one night - we were extremely tired. We finally made it downstairs,weed smell was being delt with by opening up ONE hallway window btw, and tell the receptionist our take on their hotel. To the Congress' credit she did try to accomodate us by sending a free mini-fridge to our room, seems that the hotel does in fact have them, they just happen to cost $10 extra per night. So, at this point, we just wanted to speak to the manager to let him/her know that we were very disappointed, we did this NOT to be comp'ed, we did this to air our frustration. The manager was at the other end of the reception desk so the reception clerk told us to head down and that she would be with us shortly. I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, ""fuck this place"" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, ""I'll be right with you."" We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does; during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole.

I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, ""fuck this place"" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, ""I'll be right with you."" We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does; during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole. Save your money, don't even think about staying here, because the only thing that you're paying for is the location, nothing more.";1;10;4;8;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

But I didn't know that when I booked this super cheap hotel on Michigan Ave for a conference recently. For its location and size, you can tell that the Congress must have been nice in its heyday...now it is pretty dilapidated and has a very strong, persistent Lysol smell. The rooms are pretty minimal and the beds...well, let's just say that you can tell how old they are by how small the double bed size is. Not too much you can even say about service...this place is like a ghost town.  At least it's clean and conveniently located hear Grant Park, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. But even for how cheap it was, I still feel guilt for crossing the picket line (which they still walk EVERY DAY).

I appreciated a lot of things in the bar at the Congress Plaza Hotel, named {something} Tap, like the mahogany wood, the copper bar, and the pillars surrounding the windows which made it look like at one time this area was completely open and airy. This place must have really been something, circa 1910, and it saddens me to see what it has become. The Red Bull cooler behind the bar and the neon beer signs in the window clash with the ambiance. Wait...actually, the ambiance clashes with the ambiance. There are no cocktail waitresses and the few people they have delivering the food look super ornery. The clientele is kind of a mixed bag of ""what the hell"" and ""aww, you poor thing from Idaho that accidentally booked a room here."" Still, my friends and I were in need of a little girl chat and wine so we ordered what has come to be known as The Worst Bottle of Wine Ever.

The service was good and things were set up well, if we were 5. The tables and chairs belonged in a pre-school classroom. We had ""tall boys"" too, but those were just for standing.  After 5 hours in heels I wanted to sit and enjoy my drink in peace.  But I felt like a 5 year old sitting at the table while all of the grown-ups walked by.   Side note... they don't decorate except for some white tablecloths, a table votive and red napkins.  It's all DIY, which was ok, but would have been nice if they did something for the holidays. Anyway... The food was only ok.  The chips tasted like stale poo (not that I officially know what that tastes like), but everything else was decent. It's close and convenient, but it might tell you something that they were available for a holiday party 2 weeks before the event.  3 stars because the servers were really really nice and they allowed us to extend our party for 2 hours, which means that they're also pretty flexible.

1961;6/20/2011;VL37pniCBzEyuWlQTfPKIQ;KSALDxIXjab-zajClOnzOQ;"I could not wait to get home to write this review. I wanted to write this review so bad, I was going to do it from my phone while I was waiting on my flight to go home. One thing that I've learned about reading reviews is it is a review FROM ANOTHER PERSONS PERSPECTIVE. I say this because maybe my upbringing is greatly different from other reviewers. I believe my upbringing helps me b/c I don't go to places I read reviews on and look for the issues that people complain about. I go with ZERO expectations. Some people standards are just too damn high to be honest. You can't go from eating at Brazilian Steakhouses to Applebees and review it the same.....that's just not a fair grading scale. With that being said, I read the reviews about this hotel and how dirty and how old and how dated it was and it kinda shook me up a little bit and almost made me look at another location, but I stuck to my guns and said I need to check it out for myself. I was born and raised in New York City and I believe people who are from older cities with old housing/real estate can see the bigger picture and know that buildings that are several years old is just the norm in older cities. Now to the review: The hotel served it's purpose. I came to town for the Cubs-Yankees baseball series and wanted to be in a prime location since I have never been to Chicago. It was directly across the street from Grant Park and two blocks away from the Harrison Red Line CTA Station, which was awesome. Were there people outside striking like everybody said? Yes. Did they bother me, NO.....I swear, people allow the smallest things to bother them. We got there around 11am, so it was too early to check in, so we were able to leave our bags with the bellboy in the storage room. The people that worked there were really helpful and kind. I stayed in room 691, so the view was in between buildings, but was able to see the Sears (Willis) Tower perfect. The elevators were not slow for me. Didn't have to wait no more than 2 mintues, EVER. Don't know where everybody got that one from. Slow as in speed or slow in having to wait for one? It's only like a 15 story building....how fast are they supposed to go? The room was just fine. It was an older room in an older building, but it was very spacious for three tall guys 6'4, 6'5, and 6'8. It had a TV with a remote, running water to wash up and it was very clean. That's all I ask for in my hotel stays, nothing else. Don't need my towels folded into a little monkey hanging off the doorknob in my room, don't need a mint on my pillow, don't need to get my ass kissed, just good customer service and people that do their jobs. That's pretty much it. I don't stay in hotels to admire the draperies and the paint color schemes.....just to rest my head, shower and the room be clean. In closing, I would stay here again without any hesitation. I think people should use reviews to get a good feel for what you're about to get into, but you shouldn't use them to make your decisions. If it was as unbearable as people have put it out to be, then why are they still in business, especially in the location they're in? You have to meet codes and health guidlines to keep the doors open and obviously they meet them. People just need to grow a pair and stop walking around with their noses in the air";4;23;11;10;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

Parking was a bit steep at $40 a night. The bar wasn't impressive either. Since I was staying on someone else's dime, the room was charged to a corporate credit card, and I put my personal card down for incidentals. 3-4 months after I checked out, I found a charge for $86 on my credit card from Congress Plaza. I tried calling the business office to see why I'd been charged. I never got a call back. Finally, I got my credit card company to intervene, and we placed a 3 way call to the hotel, which gave us nothing but attitude. I wound up getting the charge reversed, but it was a major pain in the ass. Also, there's picketers outside, and they've been on strike for several years over the hotel's low pay and working conditions. http://www.congresshotel… and http://www.congresshotel… has more on the shithole you'll be staying in (regardless of whether you're pro-union or not, it's still an abortion of a hotel) There's no way in hell I'd stay here again.";1;1;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

We were comped a free breakfast which honestly made no impact on our confidence of this hotel.  Why would we eat at a place we feel does not put priorty in cleanliness of their guest rooms? The front desk attendant apologized on behalf of the hotel and we never spoke to the manager face to face.   Overall, the only thing worse than finding a roach the size of your thumb sitting on your toothbrush, is the inexplicable indifference shown by the management to resolve our extreme discomfort over the whole situation.

After booking the hotel and reading the Yelp reviews, I'll admit, I was NERVOUS. I don't know who is writing these horrible reviews for this hotel, but in my opinion, they were completely unwarranted.   We were central to so many great places, and very close to public transportation. It was about a 15 minute walk down Michigan Ave to the river and the Magnificent Mile. Grant Park is right across the street. The Aquarium is a 10 minute walk.  The location was definitely the best thing about this hotel. We spoke to the concierge staff a few times too, and they were all very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to help. I am not one that has to stay in 5 star hotels with every imaginable amenity. When I'm traveling, I view a hotel as a place to rest my head at night only. Why would I want to stay in my hotel room all day when I'm in a great city like Chicago? The hotel was definitely older, but I think that gives it character! Of course, I love older buildings... my home was built in 1895. The elevators were a little small.. but who cares! My only comment was that the hallways on our floor smelled a little bit like an older woman's perfume.... but whatever! Who knows, maybe someone was staying in one of the rooms on my floor with really bad taste in perfume? The room was absolutely clean and acceptable and perfect for our needs. That being said, if you are someone who does not appreciate older charm & who needs top of the line amenities at a hotel, don't stay here. You won't be happy and you'll just be one of those people who writes a really horrible review for a perfectly acceptable hotel.";4;2;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

I was looking for good deals online for a 1 week vacation in chicago downtown, i found congress hotel for $90/night, i thought it was great deal for the location and the hotel with the big name... i have walked by congress hotel many times in the passed and i was always impressed by the historical look of the building. i didnt think that anything would be wrong with this hotel so i didnt even bother to read review. some of my issues with the hotel: rude valet personal damaged walls, paint and  doors The room smells like mold TV reception was horrible A/C unit is inside the room and was dripping all night the walls between the rooms are soo thin that i heard my neighbor talking on the phone like he was in front of me till i fall asleep. and i heard his TV like it was in my room, it wasnt bc he was too long but bc of extremly thin walls. if you know  Motel 6, i would rate it 5 stars and still give 1 star to congress hotel. i booked my 7 nights stay at this hotel thru hotwire so there was no way for me to not get charged  if i decided to check out early, but i still checked out the very next day... i lost $600 but at least i enjoyed the rest of my vacation in different hotel. I highly discourage anyone from booking  this hotel without visiting it  in person first and see the rooms...

The room?  Also pretty nice.  The key cards don't need to be slid through the door; they are just tap onto the door and you're in, which I've seen at only one other hotel (Flatiron Toshi in Manhattan).  I had a fantastic view of the skyscrapers from my window.  I noticed that by the bedside, there weren't electrical outlets at least by the tables, but you had great flat-screen TVs. There's plenty of food options that are available.  A Starbucks in the building, a small cafe type area and also a great looking place for dinner, though I can't comment on the food as I have never had the time to eat there. Check-in and check-out are also out of this world.  You can check-in with a reeptionist, or you can check in completely on a kiosk, like you're an airport.  The check-out is also handled on the kiosks as well, as well as a drop off box before you leave as well.  The doormen are very helpful and courteous.  If you're staying for business or pleasure, see if you can snag a room at this amazing hotel situated on Wacker and not far from Michigan Ave and Grant Park.  http://Hotels.com say that many of these rooms are at least $200 a night, but if you get lucky and Priceline it, you can get yourself a great bargain.  Perfect for a romantic weekend if you're looking for a good hotel to stay the weekend in Chicago.";5;2;2;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

We got downtown at about 12:00 p.m., and the nice front desk woman told me a room wasn't ready yet (understandably, because we were early), but someone would call me when it was. Now the problems start.  There was an area where we could leave our bags while we were waiting for our room.  We brought the bags over to the guy, who was very busy because the hotel was nuts, got a tag for them, and started to walk away.  The guy muttered ""seriously"" as we walked away, so my friend said ""sorry"" and ran back and gave him a $5 tip.  I was thinking that we would tip them at the end, but if he wanted it now, fine. We went out to the parade, had some fun, and came back a few hours later for our bags.  There was a different guy running the bag check area.  We got our bags from him, meaning we pointed at them, and he moved them about 5 feet to where we were standing.  He didn't bring them to our room or anything, he just moved them 5 feet.  We started to walk away, and this guy yelled after us ""no tip!""   Ok, I've worked in the service industry.  I realize that people want tips, and often depend on them.  We gave bag check guy number one $5 for putting a tag on our bags.  I do not think it was necessary to give bag check guy number two another $5.  Further, when is it ever appropriate to yell about tips at your customers?  There were about 1000000000 people getting their bags from these guys.  How much money is enough for them? That whole incident kind of ruined the hotel for me.  The room was fine, but someone needs to do something about that horribly rude behavior.";2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Hyatt Regency Chicago is very close to everything like the shopping on Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, the river, Marilyn Monroe statue, and so much more. It's all a walking distance. There are pictures that I uploaded for reference of what the inside looks like. It's spacious and the customer service provided was spectacular from the beginning to the end. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Chicago. The rate I had was $150/day which is not bad at all. It's beautiful inside and out and kept traffic moving so everyone can arrive and leave faster. Great service!";4;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

(as of 8/24/2011) so many of the previous reviews may not apply if you see folks complaining about old, outdated decor and musty corridors. First, the Hyatt Regency in Chicago is the largest Hyatt Regency in the US. They have over 2044+ rooms and two large towers. Compared to Vegas, that may seem like nothing (Vdara houses an impressive 4408 rooms!) but here in Chicago, this landmark hotel definitely has presence. I got a deal on priceline and for once trusted my fate at a chain versus the boutique hotels I've been staying at in previous visits and I have to say, for the price I paid, it was well worth it. The front desk was pleasant, check in was easy and the room was clean. It smelled, felt, and looked clean and updated. The bed was large, comfortable, and the shower was well designed so you can let it rain or turn it on power mode to wash out that stubborn conditioner in your hair. The room service was ... OK since the hotel was big and it just takes forever to get anything but aside from that it was a very pleasant experience.

For the price, the hotel and our room were surprisingly good. No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks.

Show Me: The Hyatt is very central, I can catch the El , catch a cab, walk anywhere and it's close to great great restaurants.  So I have the food situation down by staying here.  As far as visuals, my favorite places to walk to are Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago when I  am here over the weekend- two stellar attractions in the city.  Downtown Chicago is about architecture and no where in our country can you witness amazing styles from Frank Gehry to Art Deco to modernist Chicago (I like to call it because I dont know the name, LOL).  I am not an architecture person but you cannot avoid admiring this beautiful city, the structures and how it evolved to an utopia of American life.   From atop and street level of this hotel you can witness Chicago during rush hour:  a marvel of orderliness and efficiency.  People queue up to get on public transportation 24x7.  Where in the world do you see behaviour like this?  It's not like NY where ""it's every man for himself""   The subterranean roads for trucks/deliveries  separate from city traffic is genius!  Whoever thought about this solution was way ahead of her time!  I am constantly amazed that such a huge metropolis functions efficiently day in and day out, chaos minimized.  There's still traffic yes but somehow rush hour 'feels' organized here. Stay & Work: Pan back to your personal space.  Rooms at the HR are modern, very comfortable but not spacious by Cali standards.    Be prepared these are Euro/ NY-sized rooms.  I've received faxes (delivered when requested), I've sent faxes, received packages, nothing lost.  I've requested printing services, messengering, even paper and what sets the HR apart is I don't get the ""No you can't "" vibe here.   Service is prompt.  I bring a data card everywhere I go so WIFI is not an issue. I can work here and request a service and in 10 minutes max, bingo!   Gym facilities are up-to-date and clean.   I love the workout/cardio machines here more than any of the other (""Big 4"") hotels  and depend on them regularly.  I especially appreciate who ever thought about the shape of the Hyatt gym towels, they're super long enough to wrap around your neck..... long enough to lay on a machine to cover the back of your head down to your back.    If you are concerned about hygiene at the gym, you know what I am talking about.    The heating/cooling systems are efficient and never had a complaint.  Hyatt is truly making an effort to be distinct.  They're checkin process is different from most hotels.  I feel the lodging experience here is about comfort and personal service. Leave Me Alone: When you hang the DND tag on your door, they will not knock even if its after 1pm.  The will expect  for you to call Housekeeping when you want your room to be serviced or not at all.    No accidental knocking from housekeeping.  In the morning hours, housekeeping staff tend to work in the background, unobtrusively.  I like that.......Lemme sleep however long if I want to! Feed me: Food-wise, I can order a perfectly grilled steak (not cheap) or surf and turf made in the same style as a superior steakhouse like Gibsons (a mile down the block).  Oddly almost any restaurant closeby, high-end or not, will deliver to the Hyatt, no extra charge.   I use my trusty Yelp app to monocle a restaurant closeby.   I've done this before a few times...........  in the dead of winter when there's absolutely no way I'm going out there!!!.  Not even to walk 4 steps into a cab.  No way, ah- ah....LOL!

Probably the nicest suite I've stayed in to date. BEAUTIFUL furnishings and layout of the room. View from the 26th floor was great. The hotel was very acomodating and even delivered complementary chocolate to the room. Nice touch!

That, combined with the airplane noise, made me wonder why they didn't spend some renovation money on better soundproofing the rooms. In fact, if you stand long enough in the bathroom, you can actually HEAR conversations from within the elevator. So, note: if you receive a room near the elevator lobby, I suggest you change it. As for that airplane noise, I stayed in the hotel next door last year, and didn't hear a thing from the outdoors. Moving on, we were given a room in the newly renovated tower, which still had that ""new carpet"" scent. The room was huge and spacious, with a nice view of the city. The beds at the Hyatt are ALWAYS comfortable -- I love them so much, I want to buy one. But the pillows? Suck hard core. Every Hyatt now seems to stock these tiny, almost square head pillows. If I'm in a King bed, I kind of want matching King pillows, you know what I'm saying? The people who work here are amazing -- everyone from the luggage guy to the concierge to the check-in/out staff, and even the guy who hails the cabs for you. I like that the hotel has a mini store on the lower level, where I was able to purchase coffee, milk and cereal, a banana and a variety of other snacks for the room. That said, you know it costs like 3x more than if you bought it in a store yourself ($8 for said bowl of cereal, big chug milk & banana). Oh, the sake of convenience, right? Also, we had ""no smoking"" signs in our room, which made me believe that some rooms DO allow smoking, which I smelled quite frequently throughout our weekend stay. I'd stay at the Hyatt Regency again simply because of its location and value for the room price.";3;2;2;2;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The beds, pillows and comforters were so comfy! Had drinks in the Bar 151 inside, and also the ""Big Bar"" - nothing like paying $6.50 for a domestic bottle beer and $11 for a Bloody Mary, but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience of being in a hotel bar. The bathrooms were nice, could have used a little more counter-space but whatever :) I like a fairly roomy bathroom and they had good ones. I wasn't a fan of the toiletries in the room, NO one in our party liked the lotion (LOL, we had two adjoining rooms) but I always bring my own anyway. Usually if I don't use it, I'll lift the toiletries for a future trip, but in this case I passed. Not a huge deal but sometimes getting these little extra ""freebies"" is some kind of treat. Good location, friendly and accommodating staff, and I love that they allowed us to leave our bags after checkout on Sunday for a few hours so we didn't have to lug them around the city until we departed. We were on the 28th floor and I didn't find the noise level to be too bad. I didn't notice any inconsiderate neighbors, but we were nicely located at almost the end of the hall. The view wasn't the best, but interesting. Our room was facing two office buildings. Saturday it was pretty empty, but on Friday afternoon when we arrived, people were still working and we had fun peering in and commenting on the activity going on with working strangers across the way.

The bad: - Internet costs $14/day, and even if you pay for it, it doesn't work on the levels where the conference is being held. Ridiculous. No, ridiculous isn't a strong enough word, but I don't think Yelp allows me to use stronger language.  Because the conference rooms were all in the basement levels, cellphone and 4G service for your laptops/tablets was also sketchy at best. - I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, but I did eat food provided at conference functions, and was thoroughly underwhelmed by all of it. - The Hyatt is currently having a labor dispute with the housekeeping staff.

Of course if I had to choose on my next visit to the Windy City, I would choose another hotel just for a different experience. Check-in was nice and easy. The lady helping us was pleasant enough. But before I could even request a bigger room or a nicer view, we were quickly handed the keys. They probably have a big red sign flashing in red on their computer screen saying ""casual tourists, not corporate accounts."" I asked if we could get access to the Regency Club for the free breakfast daily, that got shot down. Extra $75. No thanks. Our room was no-frills, with a nice big view of an office building. Big flat screen TV and a comfortable bed, that's pretty much all we need. The walls are as thin as tissue paper, as you can hear people flushing the toilet, sneezing, or talking in the hallway. No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, or any other ""luxury"" amenities. Safe to say, I wouldn't pay anywhere near the standard rates listed on their website. Priceline prices, yeah it's about right. Maybe even a little less. Of course, the biggest advantage with this hotel is the location. We stayed in the West tower, so the elevator conveniently spits you out to Wacker street and you're on your way. It's centrally located, so you can either go north to Magnificent Mile or south to the Loop, where there is Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Art Institute, etc. Plus, it's close to all the bus and train stations.

The second time i stayed there, for the nye party the other week, we got stuck in a small room, facing east, with a small window and an ""ok"" view. They also didnt honor our request for a smoking room, and had a note on the desk saying there would be a $250 cleaning charge for smoking. But, they are decorated very nice, and the staff at the desk is really nice and patient too. wouldnt go back for the nye party though- it was so huge i spent the whole time walking around trying to find people.";4;3;2;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The location was pretty convenient- pretty much a block away from Michigan Ave. This place is huge. Everyone has conventions here, so it's always packed. It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out. I thought hotels were supposed to be all about service, so it was strange that they purposely set it up so that we didn't talk to an employee during our entire stay.";3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The Hyatt's lobby is beautifully laid out with a dining area encircle by a zen-like pond with delicately ""spitting"" waterfalls.  You can watch t.v. while waiting or just relaxing on the many sofas and chairs.  Their bar offers a stunning backdrop view of the city.   Once again, this is a hotel with lots of conventions so to get from point A to B, may take 10 mins, but the majority of all convention hotels are like that.  The difference is that you get a lovely view on your way there. Tip:  Purchase the unlimited transit passes.  DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR into Chicago.  Chicago has one of the best public transit systems that I've experienced.  Besides, it'll cost you at least $40 or more to park your car overnight at the hotels.

To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't give them that fifth star, if it weren't for the following situation: Last Thursday, I came down with the flu. I was planning on staying at my apartment, but my landlord still hadn't left for Singapore. I went back to the Hyatt after making new reservations. The concierge (who, at this point recognised me by sight because I've slept in their bed more than I did in my New York apartment) took one look at me and asked me if I needed some medication. I got to my room, and within five minutes, he'd personally brought up Tylenol, because he didn't want to have the usual 5-10min delay that would happen if he had housekeeping do it. Yes, he got a nice letter written for him afterwards :) Another story: 2 colleagues and I were staying at this hotel. Since I was staying longer (did I mention I spent more nights in the Hyatt than I did anywhere else this month?) than them, we were on separate reservations. They screwed up their room -- they gave them what is basically a party suite -- one bed in one room and the other room had bunch of couches with a pull-out bed. They were upgraded immediately to the executive floor, with zero hassles. I guess they wanted to keep our hotwire.com-based business ;) To be fair, the rooms are slightly dated -- no LCD TVs, lacking iPod docks in every room, etc. Even the executive floor (don't know about the suites) look a little dated, though they are nicer. The beds are comfortable, though, and the view can be great if you're lucky -- either to Millenium Park or towards the Maginificent Mile.";5;2;2;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The hotel is in a very good location with plenty to walk to right near it. If you are coming from Midway Airport, I highly recommend taking the train. It's about 30 minutes, $2.25, and less than a 10 minute walk from the Randolph/Wabash station (we found this to be the more convenient station to the hotel rather than the Lake/State Street one). Even though we got to the hotel at 11 am, we were able to check in and go to our room on the 32nd floor. The room itself was a pretty basic king bed room, but we didn't need anything fancy or special for one night. I did find the placement of the flat screen TV a bit odd as it was on the end of the dresser on the right side of the bed, so if were laying in bed, you could to be on your side to see it. For booking via Priceline, we actually had a room with a decent view. The only amenity we utilized at the hotel was the business center which is on the bottom level. Use of the internet for 15 minutes will run you $7.56 and printing one page will cost $0.83. So only use the business center if you really have to. If you want to use cabs to get around, there are plenty in queue all the time near the hotel, so you won't have to wait to get one. Overall, this hotel is not a bad option especially since it looks like it's pretty easy to book for a great price on Priceline.";3;2;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

This Hyatt is particularly interesting because you can access the weird  miniworld that exists underneath the buildings in this area (offices, predominately).  So if the weather is bad out, you might be able to find a few places open during business hours.  I somehow stumbled into it one night and it was a bit eerie because everything was closed, but still lit up and walkable.  Sorta like the mall equivalent of a ghost town.  I find it a bit odd that no one else has mentioned it, so maybe I imagined the whole thing.  Spoooooky....

Location: 5 out of 5 Can't really beat it if you're a tourist.  Conveniently located and within walking distance to multiple attractions.  Cabs and shuttles know where it is too so if you're flying in, you won't be stuck trying to explain where it is. Customer Service: 3 out of 5 Caveat here.  You know who the friendliest people were at this hotel?  The people working the front door either greeting guests as they arrived, or hailing the cabs.   I really didn't get a good feel from anyone else working at the hotel.  They all seemed preoccupied with something else, and honestly, I really didn't care since it was only for one night.   Even the automatic check in kiosk was disappointing.  I ALWAYS go for the kiosks if they're available because it saves me time and I don't have to wait for any doofuses.  This kiosk though - wow, slow as dirt.  It may be the one time when checking in with the actual people behind the desk would have been faster.  Anyway. Quality of Room: 3 out of 5 No real complaints - spacious, comfortable, boutique'ish toiletries.  Like I mentioned earlier, if you get stuck facing the wrong way, you'll hearing cars and trucks rumbling throughout the night.  Since I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, I didn't notice it too much, but if you're trying to watch TV, it can be a real pain in the ass. Price: 3 out of 5 Sure, I Priceline'd it, but honestly, I expected just a little bit more than what was offered.  Before you comment and say, ""It's a great hotel, look at all the amenities!"" hear me out.  When you really strip away everything that overwhelms you when you first walk in and look at it piecewise instead of as one big picture - you'll be underwhelmed.  Glass ceilings, little pond with fountains, an ""open aired"" dining area, the escalators - get past all of that and when you do, the hotel becomes above average and not any more than that. Overall: 3 out of 5 I guess bidders can't be choosers.  Not a terrible hotel, but not really anything to write home about either.  Unless you're here on yelp.";3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I say, when someone pays $180 a night to stay here, they deserve to sleep on clean sheets. There are planty of ways to be nice to mother nature...";4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

But after getting to my room...it was very underwhelming.  The room is quite small, less than 200 sqft.  The room is also unusually dark, I need a light on during the afternoon!  The desk is right next to the bed and the tv is on the same desk...get the feeling of cramped-ness yet?  The bathroom is nicely appointed and quite large (probably half the room size!).   The 2 stars is in comparison to other Hyatts I've stayed at (NYC, New Brunswick NJ, Phoenix, Albuquerque, etc...I've been to many Hyatts) and this one is probably the second worst.  The atrium is beautiful at least, so I guess leaving my room for that is an upgrade.  If staying in this part of town, I'd say to stay at the Swissotel down the street.  A bit further, but it was nicer there than here.  Maybe the other rooms here are nicer, but i can't give reviews based on assumptions and maybes.";2;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The hotel is also located very close to the infamous Michigan Avenue, where you will find the art museum, millennium park, numerous fancy-pants boutiques and stores.  Plenty of sights to see, lots of people to watch, and just a quick walk back to your room.

2079;9/6/2011;kGEp;XVijwtIS35MBtdvFNj8lbw;"First the good: 1. Great location. Very close to Michigan Ave, where all the stores & restaurants are, and the river. It's a beautiful walk from this hotel to the river and other locations. Navy pier is a 20 minute walk. 2. The hotel is huge, could be a plus or minus for some, for me it didn't make a difference. 3. Extremely nice staff at check in 4. River view if you are on a high floor and if you get a room with a view (duh) 5. Could be great value if you get a low rate The bad: 1.  The person who designed the lay out of the bathroom should be fired. The toilet paper holder (w/ the toilet paper naturally) was behind the toilet. That was really annoying as you can imagine. The water pressure was bad. They had a curtain instead of a glass door in the shower. The sink was not comfortable to use. 2. Parking was extremely expensive - $50 per night. 3. No refrigerator. If you open the mini bar and take something out, even without opening it, you get charged because the bar is activated by a motion sensor. 4. Kind of felt like they nickled and dimed you for everything. 5. Bad TV channels, nothing to watch, no HBO. 6. The coffee shop down stairs was expensive, but I guess it's not the hotel's fault. 7. No pool. Overall, I am not sure if  I would have stayed here over another similar hotel in the same price range, but if the price was low I would stay here just because the location is so great.

There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well. As soon as I walked in, the doorway was narrow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around. Also, the walls were very thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on both sides.

Check in was fine, they did allow us to check in early. I requested a non-smoking room.   I had gone online to use their concierge service which is supposed to be an easier way to request amenities.  We went to Chicago to celebrate my mom's 67th birthday so it as supposed to be an amazing experience! I ordered my mom a fruit basket for one of her surprises which she never got even after ordering it twice.  However, concierge did send her wine with chocolates for her birthday. And after the 2nd non receipt of my amenity for my mom they sent us three apples with a card congratulating me for my birthday! (rolls eyes) Before arriving to Chicago, I sent a request for dinner reservations at a great Mexican restaurant I got a phone call that their restaurants would be closed!! What the hell kind of shit is that? You are a hotel you don't close shit down when you have hotel guests in your hotel!! Ok fine the concierge was supposed to book me a reservation for 2 on my mom's birthday which was on the 24th of December, so I get a phone call from Dwayne saying that a lot of places were closed but he would try to find a place that was open.   I had checked with the concierge and that is when I found out that their restaurant was closed and that they had gotten us a reservation at Mexx. So we settled in and got ready for dinner.  We had a great dinner. However they had us down for dinner on Christmas day??!! Hmm...  Someone messed that up! Go figure! As with any information obtained from the concierge it was misinformation after misinformation! From where to find free Wi-Fi to where I could find some soul food!!  I was also told that I could not find food after midnight and that my only option was room service or the deli down in the lobby.  I didn't want either of those options! Pissed I called the front desk and told her that I wanted to transfer the room to my mom because I wanted to check out, she tried to counter act the misinformation about food access by telling me that there was definitely places that deliver to the hotel up until 5am but didn't seem phased that I wanted to leave.  Made me feel swell!!!!! Thank god I know people who live there and from there or I would have been stuck. The Room... We booked through Priceline. So I didn't pay that much per night, had I paid more I would have demanded a refund!!  It reeked of cigarette smoke and it took 2 days to go away.  The room had dust that covered some parts of the room was so thick I could write in it! The bathroom had chipped tile, a broken tub drain, and a loose screw that held the curtain rod to its hinges.   A little advice read all hotel reviews; call the hotel in advance to make sure they are 100% before booking!! And if you are unhappy with your room no matter how much you pay for it speak to a manger. I just don't understand why this hotel received 4 stars!!! It so does not deserve it.  The whole staff had no way to compensate for their lack of customer service skills and or their screw ups.  I didn't cause a scene because of my mom. Rest assured we won't ever stay in a Hyatt.  Priceline should know when a hotel is not 100% operational or is undergoing construction which is one of the excuses I heard from the front desk as to why there were putting us in a tower across the street.";1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2082;7/6/2010;C1RTXQoru6SX7pHqGnCDzQ;SD27ygPcDohKT7eyux6gsQ;"This hotel is crap. I've stayed here twice and both stays were less than impressive. The sad part is that the owners of Hyatt live in Chicago, so you'd think they would put more effort into this property but we have nicer Hyatt's in Colorado. I've stayed in a lot of the hotels around Michigan Ave and usually don't feel the need to write a review but last night's stay was ridiculous. The weather has been pretty brutal in Chicago and my apartment does not have central air, so I thought I would treat myself to a hotel for the night. Well I used Hotwire hoping I would get anything but this place, but that did not happen. I showed up around midnight because my girlfriend and I had been to the movies. Now I find sometimes if you get a really laid back night shift crew, they won't make you put down a credit card. I mean it's already midnight and checkout is at noon, why fill out more paperwork and hassle me with having to check that the ""authorization"" drops off. Well I guess this place thinks they're the W because they would not budge on a $50 authorization. $50 bucks!!! Even if I rockstar trashed the room, I'm so sure the $50 would cover it all. Oh well I let them authorize for $50 even though my room was pre-paid and then got offered a queen bed. Not okay. I can sleep on a king at home, I'm not paying to sleep on a queen. We finally compromise with a king on a smoking floor. I then asked if they knew of any late-night delivery open because I did not have my laptop to Grubhub something. The dude hands me a Sarpino's menu. WOW! The room was just what I had expected. Paper thin walls, rock hard bed and no wine glasses(just paper cups). Yeah, we got the longest bar in the country and you can't put real glasses in the room. To top it off, housekeeping woke me up at noon even though the privacy sign was up and the front desk said if I wanted to stay till 3 PM it would be 1/2 a night in price. No thank you!

You are on Wacker Road and a block on Magnificent Mile. 2. There's a Corner Bakery close to the hotel for breakfast (1 block). 3. A minute walk to major bus stops. 4. There's BIG BAR!!! (see my other review). 5. Room deco is minimal - no fancy stuff but it's very clean. 6. Millenium Park (a block), The Loop (about 3 blocks), and shopping area is a block. 7. There's a 24 hour deli which is a plus. Take note; 1. At first, I was disappointed because of the location. I wanted it to be noisy, crowded and a touristy area - maybe close to small restaurants etc. (Stay at The Loop Area or Magnificent Mile area if you prefer it that way). But it was a good decision after all. Wacker Road is a major road and it's very convenient when you are a tourist (bus stops). There's a BIG BAR open at night in the hotel and it's always crowded. I mean crowded until 2am everyday even on weekdays! 2. No free breakfast and internet. Complimentary coffee and tea though. 3. Employees are great and helpful. 4. Hotel lobby is not boutique style - it's actually convention/airport like atmosphere. Always crowded and noisy (lobby only) - the way I like. 5. Ok, just one thing... if people are talking on the hallway, it echoes to your room - I think it's an acoustical thing. It happens when we arrived there at about 10am. We usually go out at 10am so no problem at all. At night, nice and quiet. Yes, I recommend this place.";5;1;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2109;7/26/2010;x8gkUvXMt9ros2G9n72;FjOUBhA2xpVmhg2hECzGLw;"I guess it all depends on your expectations from hotels and what tickles you in that category. I'm pretty picky and I like hotels that are new, innovative, stylish and really go out of their way to make you comfortable. So based on my pickiness, adjust the star rating! Parking: This one just flat out pissed me off. I don't mind paying for quality but getting ripped off is a diff story. So they only offer Valet at $50 per day. I should have the choice to park my own car if I want to in a hotel that has two towers on two side of the street and has more than enough parking space to accommodate valet and self park. When you ask the hotel staff for alternate parking info, the response is ""we don't know of any other parking available"" which is BS. You live and work in Chicago and don't know of other parking lots? Good thing I live in Chicago too and know that the whole area underneath the hotel, the park and some of the surrounding is all multi-level underground parking. Again, being ripped off! So don't get ripped off, if you don't mind a 5-10min walk. Directly next to the hotel's parking on the lower level, you can park for $7 overnight as long as you enter between 3-6pm and leave by 8am. I went in after 6pm so they said it would be $13 as long as I left before 8am. At the end, I decided to just stay in bed so I paid $30 for 24hr period which is still better than $50 in a getting ripped off fashion. In the winter months, that might not be the best choice. Also if you're planning on going in and out, then you might just let them rip you off! Overall: I'd stay here again if I didn't have other choices or if I happen to get it on priceline/hotwire. The lobby is spacious but my favorite feature of the lobby which is the big bar on the front desk floor, is closed during the day!!!!! I'm not a big drinker but I'd much rather sit at that big bar and have lunch! It's amazing how some hotels limit the use of their best feature....maybe they just don't see that as their best feature, who knows. Rooms: I had a junior suite so my room was fairly large with a king bed, desk, very large bathroom, sectional couch and a wet bar. With all that space, I had a tiny tall window which was ceiling to floor but very narrow! The bathroom was large but I just didn't like the quality. It was somewhat older, shower head was one of those ""I can do 15 sprays but they all suck"" type of shower-heads and amazingly, as large as the bathroom was, most of it was wasted space b/c I didn't even have enough counter space to put my stuff out. Good thing there wasn't a lady with me or I would have had to make her use the wet bar for her space needs lol. Yeah right, I'd probably end up using the closet while she uses the bathroom and the wet bar! Thermostat: I'm not sure what the thermostat in the room did but it definitely didn't control the temp lol I put it on all kinds of numbers and used diff fan speeds but I was either getting frost bites or feeling like I was in a sauna. They also have an A/C vent directly above the bed to blow on you as you sleep so you wake up with frozen sinuses! Smart. Staff: Very friendly, very professional Price: When I look at their regular prices, all I think in my head is ""are you kidding me?"" I would never pay that kind of money for a hotel like this. If you're not picky about amenities and their quality the way I am, then this hotel might be a good option. It's right in the middle of everything so if you're in town with family but on business, you can take a smelly cab to the loop while your family enjoys MI Ave., Navy Pier, Grant/Millenium Park all within walking distance. You can even skip the smelly cab on the way back and just walk from the your business meeting in the loop back to the hotel.";2;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I asked the man behind the omelet-y bar thing 'which is the free continental breakfast' as was noted on my itinerary from priceline (thank god i didn't pay full price for this place!!!) and he pointed to a middle island. The tub was a little gross and moldy. The toilet didn't flush properly (which I didn't discover until about 9:30 at night (after I spent the day walking throughout the city and was so tired) And....at the risk of sounding impetulant and dumb....the TV they have....how do I say this...sucks. If it's not an NBC Universal company station, Disney or ESPN, they don't have it. Which I found to be ridiculous. It happened to be the night of the season premiere of a show I was looking forward to watching snuggled down in bed and watch...but they didn't have the channel. And it wasn't some arcane channel....it was MTV (yeah, I know....I'm ashamed, but I was on vacation and the Hills is a guilty pleasure, OK?) So...no hills....no hot soak because the tub was so incredibly gross. toilet didn't flush.... Also, with what you pay per night, would free Internet be too much to ask? Or perhaps something less than the 14 or so it was for 24 hours? I can't believe that a huge hotel would consistently nickel and dime you like that. As for the positives: I will say the bed was great- nothing beats a down comforter and the feather pillows were nice. as was the lavender citrus lotion/shampoo. But this hotel..I'm incredulous that someone would pay full price for. No one greets you as you enter....no one asked how my stay was (save for the fellow who hailed me a taxi and was the only person who treated me as a paying customer) I will never come back to this hotel ever.

There's no reason for the extra charge if you get the same crappy view, just on a higher floor. 4. Walls are thin, you can definitely hear the hallways and neighbors. Not an entirely horrible stay if you're into interior decor. Otherwise, not much to expect.";2;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah. Also, enjoyed a wonderful and filling lunch at Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby.  Try the Ahi Tuna burger and fries.....do yourself the favor, you deserve it! :)";4;2;3;2;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

This is a pricey hotel, and is probably a little bit more expensive than it needs to be. The building is old, and thusly, the rooms are not quite as spacious. However, my room did have an attached ""living"" room with chairs and another flat-screen tv, which helped stretch things out a bit. The lobby truly is spectacular. You come up from ground level by way of escalators and find yourself floored by the cathedral-esque painted ceiling and detailed architecture. Since the room was not ready by the time of check-in, the hotel offered $50 in hotel services for the wait. That $50 was used towards the amazing high tea they offer daily in the grand lobby - best high tea I've EVER had! Lots of food and you could also get a glass of champagne to boot. There was one gentleman with thick-rimmed glasses who would work the desk and he was just so helpful and delightful.

The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict. Not absolutely mind-blowing, but pretty near perfect. Only downside to the room service is that the 'late night kitchen' closes at midnight.

Bathrooms: This one was fairly clean - a solid 8/10 but it loses major points for being the size of a brook closet. It was difficult to get in and out of to close the door, and there was no good place to put wet towels after our showers. I'm smaller than an average size woman, and I had some trouble maneuvering. The updates that were done to the bathroom did give it nice modern appeal. Toilets and shower were extremely noisy. The middle of the night bathroom trip could have woken the dead from their slumber! Room: Decent size room for the price. We were told we had a queen bed, but ti felt a little snug for a queen. The bed sunk in the middle a little bit (I would assume with a bed that size that typically only one person would sleep in it at a time). Linens were comfortable and enough pillows. Decor was nice and looked as if it had been recently updated. I liked the modern color scheme. The wallpaper on the walls was peeling in multiple places. Seems like such an easy fix that just wasn't done. Location: Just a few blocks away from Millennium Park and Grand Park, steps away from all color el stations and a block away from State Street shopping. I have no complaints with it! We actually walked almost everywhere the whole weekend because of the nice weather. Overall, the hotel itself was beautiful. I wished they would have cranked up the AC a little bit more in their common areas with the highs in the mid to upper 90s in Chicago. And their lobby is on the second floor which I found to be strange and somewhat frustrating as the signage wasn't terrific when we were checking after walking with bags on a warm day. Plenty of elevators (they are split in sections of rooms which was nice for a building that size - never waited more than 60 seconds). All common areas were neat and clean, the staff we did encounter was quite pleasant. Worth the money we spent on a hotwire deal, but I'd never pay full price for this place!";4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the ""golden age"" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window.  My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, ""Hollywood-style"" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.)  The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.)  The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout.  So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.)  The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers.

I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers.

After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of ""This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find""! One could argue that another perspective would be- ""This is an extra store room""! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night!

Our check in was great, the staff person was fantastic, offering us great food recommendations and was very friendly.   He offered us the option to upgrade to the executive tower/room.  It was $45 more per night, it included a bigger room, that didn't look straight at another building, a DVD player, WiFi, and the executive lounge that offered free continental breakfast each day, non alcoholic beverages throughout the day and happy hour appetizers and snacks each night.  We went for it and I think it was worth it.  The room was comfortable, the lounge was great to pop into to grab a drink or snack.  It would have been better if a drink or two was also included, but the bar was open from 3-11 each night, so it was nice to have access to that.   The executive floors have their own ""express"" elevators, a business center and some cozy couches/chairs with TV's. The only downside that I can mention is that they ""concierge"" was non responsive and even when we left a message on their line, we were NEVER called back.  Really?  That seemed strange.  But we let it go.  Also, the maids were not the greatest.  They made the bed but failed to take our breakfast dishes (they just left them all on the tray), and they didn't change out our towels, instead, just folded them back up and replaced them (we could tell, because one of them had corn flakes on it from a spill we had earlier).";4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2161;6/11/2012;7RpOLkiz83Ranfxctj9;NPRyDEG1D2taLdbdXhrNlA;"Two weeks ago I celebrated my birthday in Chicago and had the great fortune of staying at the Palmer House Hilton for five days. There are many adjectives that I could use to describe the Palmer House but the words elegant and character are at the top of my list. This is an absolutely terrific hotel and if you have never stayed there, at least do yourself the favor of dropping by for a drink or lunch. This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a ""grand"" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say ""Wow"" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world. The courtesy extended by Tatyana was impressive because of its rarity and its genuineness. The hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago's O'Hare airport. You can walk to Millennium Park, the Navy Pier, The Chicago Art Institute and there are good restaurants nearby like ""The Gage,"" the upscale ""Russian Tea Time"" or casual Bennigans. For your morning coffee go around the corner and have Dunkin Doughnuts! This is a fantastic hotel and I look forward to spending my next birthday there!";5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I came here in hopes for a relaxing spa day with my girls.  I know parking is crazy expensive in the loop, but they have 24 hour valet which is much cheaper so its fine right? No.  I get to the front and the bell man says no valet.... I point the sign that says 24 hour valet in confusion.... man says no... and i think to myself- WTF? ??  so... I end up having to park in some garage across the street and the bell man assured me I could get my parking validated. So fine.   The elevators are SO small.. and old... and seriously I thought I was gonna get stuck in one.  But that is not why I am giving this hotel 1 star.  I am giving this hotel 1 star because I have never experienced such nasty service at any other hotel before. I had to get my parking validated after our time at the spa.  The spa sent me downstairs.  First I got to the concierge.  They can't validate it.  So then I am sent to the front desk... There's a crazy line of people checking in so I thought - well- validation takes 30 seconds so let me just ask someone to validate it.  I go up to someone real quick and ask politely... he responds with a sarcastic rude tone- ""you want validation??? stand in line and you'll get it""   Are you kidding me? I did not respond because I just didn't know what the beep to say to his rude a$$.  How do you seriously talk to a customer like that???  I'm still in disbelief.  Then I stand in line.  After 15 minutes, I finally get to someone and ask him to validate it.  He informs me that since I was not a guest at the hotel, I cannot be validated.  I told him about their valet service not working and he said that its not working today bc the president was at their hotel the day before- what does that have to do with anything?!?! I told them the bell man dude in the front of the hotel said I could be validated, but again I got attitude from this front desk guy.  Then I told them that the spa said the front desk could validate me-- he said go back up to the spa so they can validate me-- but hello they are the ones that sent me downstairs!?  He said he needs proof from the spa... I offered to show him my receipt from the spa but he wasn't having it.  I mean, did I look like a young illiterate teenage punk to these people or something? I'm a freakin 30 yr old physician. WTF. I have NEVER experienced this type of stupidity and crappy service and disrespect of customers from any hotel in chicago before-- not the elysian, not the intercontinental, not affinia, not sofitel, not the W, not the Wit, not the Dana, not the Amalfi, not the Trump, not even the freakin comfort suites!  And also, I kind of was a guest at the hotel--- how bout the fact that I was a guest at the hotel's sorry excuse of a spa and each of my friends got 2 services done and we spent half a freakin day at this crap hotel.  I was fuming but left.  Got to the parking garage and saw that I had to pay 30 some bucks for parking, which would have been around $14 or less if they had their ""24 hour valet service"" working, OR would have been zero dollars if validated.  That's just not the point tho, I have money to spend, but after the responses and attitude I got from these highly untrained workers, it was just really disappointing.   There is SOOOO much more to this story but I have lost the energy to tell any more of it.  All I know is that for a hotel to make themselves out to be so prestigious, they sure do treat their guests like dirt.  I will NEVER be back here.  I would never recommend this backward hotel to anyone ever. OH- and their SPA SUCKS btw.  NEVER AGAIN... stick to the Elysian (Waldorf Astoria) people.";1;6;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

This hotel was one of the worst I have stayed at in terms of convenience. Big giant old tv in the room. NO fridge. Tiny room for over $200/night. I was here for a corporate event, and even the customers who came to visit during the day were complaining about the confusing layout of the hotel. Its ornate and beautiful, but that's about it. There are two places to eat at the hotel, that's it. One is closed during the day. So, one place to eat. ""Good luck getting breakfast"" the lady at the front counter joked no too long ago. She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get ""wifi"" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later. There is no one after me staying in the room, but, apparently it is hotel policy to Charge $50 if you check out at 1pm. This place is a joke. DO NOT STAY HERE. Instead, check out an air bnb, that's what I'm doing for the rest of my trip here :) Oh, also... This place is haunted... Heard multiple people say they heard whispers ;) PS: Paris Hilton sucks too.

I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel ""doesn't have a Customer Service department"" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk ""handles customer service."" She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, ""I am in the office all day but unable to take your call."" Is that even a thing? Every single time I called, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes at least. The total disregard for customer service was both ridiculous and time-consuming.

The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces.

The hotel is in close proximity to most everything downtown, so you will not have trouble getting around. I'd suggest stopping for a drink at Potter's or dinner at Lockwood restaurant, but not actually staying at the hotel.";3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I was sure the rooms would be just as nice. Unfortunately, I was slightly let down once I walked into my room. The lighting could've been a lot better, the bathroom door didn't close correctly, and the TV they had was probably the oldest TV I've seen in a hotel room in a while (it wasn't even a flat screen...WTF?). I don't like how these ritzy type hotels charge for internet. I mean, if you're going to charge us that much for a room, at least provide us with some internet so we can get work done, check our emails, Yelp...you know? But other than that, I was comfy in my room. Location was great, next to Millennium Park, short walk from the Cultural Center and Art Institute, and a bunch of restaurants nearby. There was also an entrance to the subway line right in front of one of the hotel entrances. I'm not quite sure if I'd stay here again. Depends on the neighborhood and prices and everything.

If the hotel were a person, it'd be old-money.  (Like the cranky great-aunt you hope to inherit from.)  But like old-money, there's some rust around the edges.  The lobby is amazingly gorgeous.  No hands down.  The guest rooms... kinda small and shabby, for a Hilton.  The closet and bathroom were tiny.  There was only about a foot of clearance betwixt door and dunny in the loo, and that doesn't really work.  There was only about 6"" of vanity space on either side of the sink.  I'm sure this was standard when the place was built, and it's modern standards that have changed.  But still.  It's a bit cramped, and it was just me in the room. Realistically, it's an older building, and a skyscraper at that, which is going to entail lots of structural support to work around.  Revamping the guest rooms would probably entail knocking down walls and re-doing entire floors, which would be disruptive to other guests, a loss of revenue, and there'd be fewer rooms available in the end.  (I think.  I'm a CPA, not an architect, but to my amateur eyes, it does not look like it'd be an easy remodel.)  Sorry.  HGTV moment.  Where was I?   Also like old money, this place can be cheap in irritating ways.  $15 (or more) for internet in your room, and wired at that, so no surfing while sitting in bed.  $7 for an hour for internet in the lobby.  WTF?  On the one hand, if I lived in Chicago, and the lobby had free internet, I'd be inclined to take up space there quite often.  On the other hand, $7 for an hour of internet in the lobby??   I've never been somewhere where internet in the lobby came at a price.   (There was too much stone for my T-Mobile smart phone to get any signal.  Which meant I missed a couple calls.  Grr.) Thanks to Yelp I was forewarned about early check-in fees and late check-out fees.  I was honestly surprised that storing my luggage didn't come with a fee.   I didn't interact much with the staff, but they seemed very professional, especially at the front desk.  (I'd put my hotel room keycard behind the magnet closure in my purse, so I had to get it re-programmed at 1:00am.  They asked for ID, which is reassuring, for safety reasons.) I'm glad I came here, at least once.  The public areas are beautiful, and I like pretty architecture.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again as a place to stay, though.  I would, however, definitely be willing to meet people in the lobby for cocktails.  As long as we didn't expect to use our cell phones to find each other.";3;3;3;5;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The rooms were large, clean, and didn't make you feel like you were sleeping in a hotel straight out of the 80s and the hotel is in a great location very close to Millennium Park! For some reason it was hard to get a hold of the concierge and I was put on hold more than once for longer than I deem appropriate at such a hotel. Twice I even hung up and called back and got an answering machine rather than a real person! Me thinks they need to hire more staff! I also requested that a wireless internet bridge be delivered to my room when one became available; a request that was ignored and never followed up on to explain whether there was availability or not.

I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the ""off"" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11"", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the ""guest service hotline"" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the ""hotline"". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.";2;9;2;2;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience.

I didn't realize we were right next to the train tracks, but the sounds didn't really bother us. We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said ""wait at CVS and you'll see someone there."" No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon..

Many rooms are reasonably large (though if you scrounge for the cheapest rate it's on one of the tiny ones). Good prices at times. Stayed 3 nights around New Year's Eve for about 300 all-in. THE BAD: ""Old school decor"" also means poor room lighting and tiny bathrooms. Deteriorating service for Hilton HHonors members. Staff takes an attitude of, ""We've provided the minimum guaranteed benefits, and that's all you're going to get.""

This definitely isn't a motel six where you can cram a family of five for 80 bucks. My only gripe with the hotel is how the rooms are laid out. It can be a bit of a hassle to reach your final destination - your room. You'd think it was enough to fly, go through security checks, possibly experience the dreaded and inconsistent el from either O'Hare or Midway... but no.

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals.

Also, there were five - yes five! - weddings on the Saturday of our stay, so the hotel was very busy. Even with that, we had no noisy neighbors disturb our son's naps or sleep at night.

2287;11/17/2010;NlmdKg9px1fDh8kuPOeQ-A;3QhuMZBKdz2-fRvVTCWizA;"When we got engaged, we planned our wedding almost exactly a year out.  Being a perfectionist and very organized, I started searching through bridal magazines and websites to plan our wedding.  I saw the Palmer House on the first day of looking at venues and knew that was where we would have our wedding.  Looking into the Grand & State Ballrooms just took my breath away.  We got married on Saturday, June 5th, 2010 at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago. We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said ""no problem"" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said ""no problem"" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard ""sorry we're booked"".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She ""WOWED"" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together! Thank you Jane!";5;3;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I can't vouch for the restaurant (since I am obviously a cheapskate), but the pool and hot tub were great, and never packed since they were tucked away on the 7th floor. And what other hotel is going to have an entire room for elevators?

It's the real deal.  The current version of the Palmer House opened in 1925 but it's origins date back to 1871.  Even if you don't stay here, stop by and have a martini at the lobby bar.  Soak up the atmosphere around you.  Think of all the history that has passed though this lobby and the people that have had a drink at this bar.  The roaring 20's, Black Friday 1929, WW II, heck it is even quite possible that Al Capone and his henchmen had a drink at this bar.  The rooms are small by modern standards and the bathrooms are very small.  Remember this hotel was built in 1925, and at that time these were large rooms.  The water pressure in the shower was very low but again this is a historic hotel and we were on the top floor.  As with most Hilton properties the bed is very comfortable.  Down pillows and comforters are always a hit in my book.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I feel that the bellmen and doormen outshined the rest of the staff I came in contact with.  They were sincerely friendly, funny and helpful.  During our departure, our bellman ran out into traffic on State Street to hail us a taxi.  It almost looked like a cop commandeering a car during a police chase.  I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone doing the tourist thing in Chicago, especially if you are a history buff.";4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there. We booked a room both times using hotwire and were able to score a $78 (for a saturday and sunday, friday for my bf's mom was $73) deal. Good sized room, double beds, and with a window looking at another wing of the hotel.

This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a ""do not disturb"" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am! (which, to someone on PST felt like 6:30am wakeup, esp. after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before!). SUN.   3:14am woken by screaming fight next door (apparently some jerk ditched his GF).   7:00am woken up by someone in the room on the other side decided it was a good time to SING. 8:30-9:30am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning (we'd finally learned to put the do not disturb (or polish our door!) sign up at night). Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.";2;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

At first I was a little taken aback with regard to the size and configuration of the rooms, but then I remembered it was just remodeled not built new so it's not really set up for some of what I'd call more 'modern-sized americans.' My issues with the room through were three-fold. First, the air filter hadn't been changed in a while, so it was dirty and would bang back down onto the ceiling after the unit shut off. Easily fixed. Second, the apparent lack of storage. Yes there was a tiny closet, but where do I put all of the other crap I had with me for a week long stay? Then I discovered the dresser drawer hidden below the bed (I had a king room). Neato! Third, and this was the one issue I couldn't correct, the lighting. Argh. It was so 'energy-efficient' that it was nonexistent in certain parts of the room... like on the desk! Not cool when you're here for a work trip. And yeah there are LED task lights on the desktop but it didn't improve the situation any... so I ended up doing most of my work on the bed itself - though not without banging my knees on the wood sideboard a couple of times. I didn't spend a bunch of time in the room, but who wants to do that anyway when you're in another city? Other than those qualms, I really liked Felix, and the price we got through Priceline ($99/night, I think) made it much more manageable. I really enjoyed the location, within easy walking distance from some awesome restaurants, public transit, and whole foods, and just a generally relaxed vibe with nice staff.

2309;4/29/2012;FbbP2LPXY4zYeLGnIM8OZQ;jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw;"Here is a rare, 5FF non-food review on our 3-day, 2-night stay, someplace near every touristy shindigs in Chicago. I booked this 15% off, transient deal via http://hotels.com at about $99 per day for Easter weekend.  I was warned that bringing a car to Chicago requires lots of spare change, where Felix's nearest self-parking structure (at Clark St & Huron) costs $30 for 24 hours, & $44 for valet, & word-of-mouth free if a hybrid is driven.  DL & I decided to park our non-hybrid rental car, lodge at the 5th floor, and end up with a paid-what-we-got, eco-friendly, & elegantly modern & ""minimalist"" weekend... First I want to point out some advantages.  If you are pro-green, OR you--and a ""friend""--don't mind a SMALL (albeit forewarned), tight yet warm space *_*, Felix welcomes you to this.  They carried H2O+ bath-&-body travel products.  We had a safe & booked a queen sized bed, which had clean & medium-firm cushioning that we fell asleep easily.  Thank goodness no other room noises were audible.  FREE (unsecured) wifi is my over-the-top priority, which was why I thought this hotel convinced me enough for this amenity. This could be a con to some individuals, but the wall-supported LCD TV had mediocre screen quality, & the cable channel selection wasn't that numerous: no Disney Channel or Food Network.  Though they did have Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, TBS, ESPN, etc. The disadvantages are things that require a high tolerance of change.  What do I mean by that?  One, we rested on 4 perfectly squared pillows, rather than the quintessential rectangular-ish ""clouds.""  Two, our get-what-we-paid-for deal came with a view of shanty buildings on the Erie [Street] side... Three--and personally the most important factor--was our bathroom.  I didn't mind the stand-only, curtained shower or the open-faced cabinet hovered above the toilet.  However, what felt awkward & quite frustrating were our atypically rectangular designed sink & our towel hanger.  Perhaps this minimalist approach would be a sink, shaped like a massive appetizer platter, that realistically one person can comfortably & conveniently set his/her ""minimalist"" toiletries on the available space?!  And perhaps this methodology encourages the showered, soaked guest to walk to the opposite side of the shower just to snatch that thick, not-so-soft white towel?! Oh, almost forgot number four: sleeping surely was a breeze, UNLESS one religiously needs to use a noisy A/C.  Yes: sounds like Felix is dead serious when it comes to being eco-friendly ;D. One last advantage was quick & to-the-point service without rushing us.  Specifically, they informed us that our 2 hotel cards were required as our ""key"" to use the elevator after 9pm.  For our very first trip to Chicago I conclude that my arrangement with Hotel Felix was not too shabby, yet it would be a Plan B or Plan C decision for the average tourist who has minimal essentials & can leave a little extra room for ""souvenirs.""";3;42;44;40;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2310;1/14/2012;JdFdz;3P27t_P_JEdMIeej2toNjw;"Hotel Felix differentiates itself on style. A self-professed ""eco-hostel,"" the zen interior isn't limited to the spa - it's everywhere. In the lobby, there's a pool of water and a stack of logs (along with the requisite modern furniture). The rooms are also styled in a clean, almost Japanese style. Overall, very stylish. It's in a great spot, too. The hotel is close to Gold Coast shopping, River North galleries, and - should you choose - the tourist traps near Lasalle and Ontario. But, while Felix managed to differentiate itself through style, it still hasn't distinguished itself in service. In fact, service is pretty poor. Whether it's the nonchalant staff at the front desk or the ambivalent cleaning staff, customer service could use some help here.  Upon arrival, the hotel lost (and then found, without apology) my reservation through http://hotels.com. Upon entering my room, a dirty towel and used soap remained in the shower. I checked in at 6 PM, giving the cleaning staff plenty of time to tidy up. The room is also pretty small and the oversize furniture doesn't help the situation. The saving graces are there, though. First, there's price. For the location, the price is unbeatable. My total bill was still only in the double, not triple, digits. The business center and gym are convenient and well-equipped. The restaurant - Elate - is first-rate. The bar's not too shabby, either.

So when you have to take twice as long in the shower to wash the soap away because no water comes out of the faucet and you're flushing the toilets at least three times instead of only once, how exactly is that saving any more water? Just curious. It's apparent this hotel is only trying to be ""eco"" so that they can save money on their end. Also Yelpers please take note, internet is slow as hell here, there is no bathtub, no mini-bar, and no reason that I could ever justify spending this kind of money (close to $200) to stay in a Holiday Inn/Motel 6 using an ""eco chic"" marketing angle in attempts to pass themselves off as a 4 star hotel. I hightailed it out of there after the first night and I made sure I picked a gas guzzling cab, cranked the a/c, and put all the windows down just to even my carbon footprint score a bit. I should have immediately gone to buy some aerosol hairspray and deodorant and left the lights and TV on 24/7 at my next hotel the whole rest of my vacation in order to make up for all the hardships I had to put up with after staying at that place.

2322;8/25/2009;lVV3kd22i;jMzmali07h-XH1YpiiM3AA;"What does a Do Not Disturb sign on a hotel room door mean to you? To me, it means one of two things: 1. Do not disturb. 2. I don't want my room serviced. Evidently, it does not mean those things to the housekeepers at Hotel Felix. We had several rather unpleasant altercations with the housekeepers at Hotel Felix during our recent trip to Chicago. On our first day, we put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and they did not come in, only leaving a message on our machine that if we needed new towels just to let them know. On our second day, we kept the sign on our door. Even though it was there and still there when we returned later that afternoon, we found that our room had been serviced. The next morning, the sign was still on the door. Around 7am, my mom and I both awoke to someone trying to get into our room. We sat up and found that housekeeping wanted to service our room...AT SEVEN AM. WTF? You would think that they would catch our drift having that sign on there all the time - we don't want to be disturbed and we don't to have our room serviced. It's a ""green"" hotel right? Why do they want to get in our room so bad? Well, the next morning after that at NINE AM, I answered a knock at the door: Housekeeper: ""I see this sign on your door. Do you want service?"" Me: ""No service. Also, do not disturb."" Housekeeper: ""I see the sign, are you sure you don't want service."" Me: ""I don't want service and I don't want to be disturbed. That is why I put the sign on the door."" Housekeeper: ""Are you sure?"" Me: ""Yes"". Closes door. Finally, they left us alone for the last two days that we were there. It seems strange that I don't want housekeeping, but I don't want to waste resources and I don't like people I don't know touching my stuff. On the day that we were checking out, we were standing in front of the elevators on our floor about to go down to the main desk. A housekeeper stepped out of a room right next to us and asks if we were in room 1107. We responded yes and she rushed right down to our room right away. We hadn't even left for 2 minutes and she already wanted to get down there. Strange. We also witnessed one of the housekeepers vacuuming in the lobby area during the hotel's happy hour, with everyone standing around looking in shock. I dunno what was up, but they have some crazy housekeepers there. The rooms are small and the air conditioners turn on about every 10 minutes, making the rooms frigid. The gym is okay, but closes at 9pm, which is rather early. There are no glasses in the room, which is strange because there is an ice bucket. Isn't it a 4 star hotel? I would expect many more amenities that what we received. Also, they lost our reservations. So we arrived, tired and in a city we had never been to haggling with the concierge for 45 minutes before we finally got our room.";2;5;3;4;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2323;4/1/2009;PH;Y2iLLq02CUVfKHsowQ4wXw;"Even though my stay at the Hotel Felix wasn't perfect, I'm still giving it five stars because I know they just had a few brand-new-hotel-kinks to work out. All in all, this place is fantastic - perfect location, close to everything, super-cool ambiance (modern and cozy), really comfortable beds, huge showers, friendly staff and good service and a big eco-friendly emphasis. Three bummers - the restaurant/bar wasn't open yet, the TV movie and check out system didn't work, and the front desk wasn't staffed on a Monday morning to call for check out. But...I'm confident these will all be remedied shortly and when they are, this will be my new favorite hotel in Chicago. Oh...and it was CHEAP!

2324;7/8/2009;UP6r3ymW;YhIYQRzr6zpNMWAYhr23ZQ;"I absolutely loved my stay at Hotel Felix.  I booked a King room the weekend of June 20th.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  It seemed like 4-star service at a 3-star price.  The room was very comfortable; the mattress and pillows were cushy to my taste.  I loved seeing the Chicago skyline from my window. I enjoyed a quick workout in the small-ish but clean fitness center.  Although it was small, it didn't feel claustrophobic.  The windows helped. I also have to compliment the spa.  Again, it was very small, but I actually prefer the coziness.  The massage therapist gave me one of the best I've had.  At $85, it was well worth it.  I ate dinner after the massage, and pretty much slipped into food coma after that.  Luckily I had a comfy bed, and a big old TV with movie rentals.  I totally girled out and rented a chick flick.  What better way to spend some days off?   The location is great to walk to various places downtown, but I can't really recommend hanging out downtown.  There are much better places to spend your time and money.  Fortunately there are plenty of train lines around. I highly recommend a stay at the Felix.  Although I booked a great rate on Hotwire, I'd be willing to pay the regular rate, which isn't bad at all.";5;2;1;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

The rooms, while nicely appointed, are a little on the small side.  The rooms come with flat screens, free wifi and a work desk.  Bed was very comfortable.  Outside noise from the hallways entered the room pretty easily, and my room was at the end of the hallway.  Can't imagine what staying across from the elevator sounds like. Showers are awesome, but the sink is very small with barely enough room to fit your hands under the faucet to wash them.  Also, there is no room around the sink to keep any of your stuff on. They have a spa, and I tried to set up a massage.  Was told they had 3 appointment for the next day in the late morning/noon area.  Got off the phone with them, called the front desk to arrange late checkout, called right back and supposedly they were all booked.  Talking about a 2 minute window here.  I don't think it was even physically possible to field that many calls that quickly.  Don't call yourself a full service spa if you can't fit in one massage in an 18 hour window.

I'm a girl who makes the concierge my best friend so not having one was a big deal for me. However, the front desk people were helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the doorman gave  decent directions.

As for the rooms, yes they are small, but whatever.  They are clean, seem kind of hip, and the bed is totally freakin' amazing.  Like seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  And I guess the blackout curtains would have been nice if I didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn every morning I was in Chicago for a conference... I personally did not have a problem with the sink but I can see how people might, and the shower is wonderful.  Not to mention the H20 brand toiletries, a local Chicago brand, nice touch! On to the service.  The doormen are so nice.  So nice in fact when I saw one of them on the street a few blocks from the Hotel he said hello and wished me a wonderful day.  The front desk staff are another story.  They are baffled by what I would consider normal touristy questions such as ""how do I get to this neighborhood"" etc.  They actually gave us the wrong information.  Good thing we didn't listen to them. Also, the noise level may bother some.  You can hear a lot.  You can hear the elevator ding.  You can hear the shower next door.  You get the picture.

2330;3/6/2012;QjGj0kqLjBdo8OVpyDp4lQ;ef2x0pAGvT1_8fl4vi4Ovw;"DO NOT STAY HERE! Last weekend we traveled to Chicago for celebrating a bachelorette's party. We booked this hotel via Priceline's name your own price. Upon our arrival, we were notified that we were only able to stay in two rooms with a single queen size bed in each room. Okay, we have EIGHT girls in our group. We were unable to change the room------In an extremely rude and awful manner, the front desk receptionist insisted that it was the rule because we booked via Priceline and they were all sold out that night. Okay. We asked for adding an extra bed. They said they did not have any rolled bed option. Fine. No apology at all and the receptionist spoke with us with a poker face and as if we owe her 100000000 bucks. That night , we then asked for some extra blankets and pillows for making our own ""bed"" on the floor. Yes, three of us had to sleep on the hard floor. The other three of us had to squeeze on the queen size bed in an uncomfortable way. The front desk gave us a couple (6) thin blankets  and then said ""we were out of blankets"".  The service man delivering the blankets was in an absolutely bad manner too. In the end we were offered another two thin bed sheets.......... It was chilled last weekend in Chicago.  What's more, the bathtub clotted in one of our rooms and the water drained super slow................  The technician responded and came for help very quickly (and very courteous). But he said it was probably due to a lid of the shampoo bottle......so he was not able to get it fixed. The second day, we were in hope of having some other guests from larger room checked out so that we would be able to switch room.  We called the front desk at 7:00 AM in the morning (cuz they told us to do so..............) and the receptionist said we should be able to get ""TWO"" larger rooms and he told us to call back before we headed out (so that they could get ready). We called the receptionist around 10:30ish AM and he told us to pack our luggage and drag our luggage to the lobby for moving to our ""TWO"" new rooms. When we arrived at the lobby, the receptionist said ""you were only able to get one larger room"" . OKAY, we eight gals all packed and dragged our luggage to the lobby and now you told us we got only one room changed???? The receptionist (a different one from the first day) was once again very rude and very impatient from the very first beginning. He even said ""DID YOU GET IT?"" This is totally unacceptable. Finally they gave us a new larger room (with two queen size beds)  and a new smaller room with one queen size bed.   We did not change hotel because we all traveled for a long time and very tired and did not want to pay 80ish bucks still to Priceline if we cancelled the reservation. The rooms were very small. If you travel alone, I think it totally works. However, never stay here in groups. The beds were with very hard and sharp borders. With the very limited space, you bump into those sharp borders easily when moving in the room. Three of us got bruises because of this. The AC system was pretty loud in the room and the outlet was in a strange orientation. The second night the heat air blew directly on my face all night long. Are you sure this is a 4-star hotel given the poor quality of service and all of the above?   The bellmen were courteous though and we were greeted nicely (only by the bellmen). IMHO, this hotel has serious management problems.";1;3;1;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Lets start with the front desk service.  It needs some serious help in the 'service' department.  Dismissive comments and rolling your eyes doesn't help me when I ask you simple questions like 'Can you direct me to the nearest train stop?' 'Can you tell me how to get to Ukranian Village?""  I apologize, I am not a native of Chicago and yes - I'm a noob.  Thankfully I have an iphone and with an extra 5 minutes of research, yeah I can figure it out I guess - but thoughtI'd leverage the 'service'.    After I learned that lesson..  all was well.. on to the room. The room is super clean, nice, and the bed is amazing.  I mean really comfortable.  The blinds are bad ass.. no light is getting through them. It can be turned into a cave at 2pm with no light getting in.  Drawbacks - sound.  I can hear people coughing in their rooms, brushing their teeth, running the shower, slamming their doors.  The room I had was at the end of the hall way - Yet I could still hear the 'elevator ding' (located in the middle of the hall).   Thankfully I can overcome secondary sounds.. others may not. Overall I'd stay here again - I liked it.  If you have the extra cash, check out the spa - its an AVEDA spa on the 2nd floor.";4;1;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

The little bar/coffee bar is a cute intimate touch. Rooms: were very cute. They're really small, but for one person on a business trip, it was great.

The only lacking component is a spacious closet, so if I had stayed for a week or longer, I would have grown tired not having enough space to hang clothes. On the other hand, the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever slept in at a hotel and the shower is well designed and doesn't take forever to heat up. The bar is a great place to relax, though they could bump up their selection some - the night I went down to relax they only had 3 beer offerings. Another big plus - Absolutely free internet service, which was fast. Also a plus, no annoying login process each time you connect!

I really didn't mind the small space since it was very well designed and decorated. My main complaint would be the bathroom.

The young lady who I checked in with, Noemi(spelling?) was very cordial and VERY HOT! I'll be back in Chicago several times over the next 6 months and I plan to stay at Hotel Felix again.  Oh yeah!  FREE WIFI!  That was awesome.  What a great touch.  So many hotels charge from $10 - 30/day which i ridiculous!!  Free wifi is awesome!";5;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

I never had more than a $5 cab ride to anywhere, save the airport. There is a Walgreens across the street for the dental floss you forgot to pack and a whole foods across the other way for room snacks or a quick familiar bite. The roomservice/restaurant Elate was very good. I opted for breakfast in bed one day: french omlet (chervil is my new favorite herb), potatoes, toast, fresh squeezed OJ and coffee. It was about $25 for this luxury, but well worth it! The food was large in porportion, delicious, delivered, and you'd pay the same or more if you went out for breakfast anyways. The room was a bit small, but I wasn't planning on doing pilates or a dance routines in it or anything. The beds were beyond comfortable, and between the free wi-fi and TV programming(They even had HBO), floor to ceiling windows with great views and black-out curtains for those lazy hung-over vacation mornings-- I was more than content. There was a room safe, iron w/board, and hair dryer. I would suggest bringing your own hair dryer if you're a ""hair"" person, a lighter and a fan might dry your hair better than that little sucker did. And they take a ding in my book on the water pressure. It was one of those ""tickle"" showers. I think it's due to the overall  conservation theme of the place. The provided mini products (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, bar soap, body butter)  from the spa were definately thieving worthy-- I took home all the body butter I could get (they replenish them daily, whether you empty them out or not). The staff was nice--front desk people were a little stuffy, bartender was really sweet and made some fine beverages, but the valet/taxi guys were the best. They were all very knowledgeable in regards to what/where/when to do, just about anything you could come up with while in Chicago and are more than happy to get you a ride there or direct you by foot. They were cheerful and friendly every day, even in the rain.";4;1;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Lots of good restaurants in walking distance. Everyone is bitching about the room size but honestly, compared to a lot of other more expensive Chicago hotels, i.e. the Palmer House, the Intercontinental, etc. the rooms were really not that small. The rooms were also modernly decorated,  and the bed is very comfy. You can control the thermostat (in some eco hotels this is an issue). The bathroom is big and the shower(water pressure, SPA toiletries, set up) is good too. One of the things I hate about some upscale/boutique hotels is there is always an absence of drink/ice machines. Maybe they feel the machines are too Motel 6y, but when all you're offering is a $6 hot bottle of water I appreciate a $3 Gatorade from a machine. AND, this is just an assumption, but I think there is a drink/ice machine on every floor. NEGATIVES - A shit view. Just a dumpy looking roof and bricks. Elate's breakfast menu on their website is completely different then what they actually have. It is the same old omelet, $8 side of bacon that most hotels have, thats why you should just hike two blocks to either Eggsperience if its late or Yolk any other time before 3pm. But the staff was great and okayed a late check out and its close to Michigan Ave. if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, cabs are easily acquired.";3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Checked in with quite possibly the slowwwest front desk staff on this continent. I have checked in to a hotel in Morroco where no one spoke english and it went smoother. We get to the hotel and got up to the room , small room but thats allright , to find out that apparently the carpet was soaked. I found this out when I kicked off my shoes and stepped on to the soaking carpet. Nice. Had to leave to go to work so down to the painfully slow desk I went.  Told the woman working the desk about the carpet and her response was:  ""really?"" After a moment of awkward silence I asked if perhaps by chance if she wasn't busy could she wrangle me up a new room. Her response was: 'Hmmmm. Let me see."" Says she can get me a room later and she'll call me when its ready. Got a call several hours later , the new room is ready we'll move your bags , new keys will be waiting at the desk etc... All is well I think , They made a mistake and now are correcting it. Ah yes. Go back to the Felix and the bags haven't been moved , the keys are not ready and now my key to the slop soaked room from earlier will not work. Back down to the desk not once but twice to get everything rectified. The new desk clerk has no idea what is going on and is moving at a pace that makes the first clerk look like Jesse Owens. I started out giving this three stars but have since moved it to one. If you want to see the best thing going at the Felix just walk by and say hi to the doorman.

Hotel Felix *just* opened so the restaurant isn't even up and running and they're ironing out some kinks, but they make up for it with great and personal customer service. some examples: - i noted on our reservation that it was our anniversary and they had a bottle of wine and a hand-written note waiting in our room - when a surprise rainstorm hit on our last day, the front desk scared up an umbrella for us to borrow for the whole day - even though our stay was short, all the doormen remembered us and greeted us warmly and personally each time we returned. ...add to all this that the hotel is extremely eco-friendly (it has silver LEED certification) and affordable and you have a winner.";4;1;1;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

I was traveling alone, but this room was claustrophobic! I can't imagine how a couple or worse- a family could stay in that room.

Moving onto the hotel...the review will be done in categories (at least the categories most important to me). Room:  Clean, modern and sleek.  Definitely liked the decor and the cleanliness.  This is a boutique hotel and I have found that the synonym for boutique is small.  I booked a regular hotel room and it was much smaller than what I'm used to.  There was very little walking room around the bed and the small desk.  Personally, cleanliness overrides room size for me so I'd still give the room category 4 stars. Transportation:  Chicago's public transportation is easy, reliable, and clean.  From O'Hare airport, you can take the blue line to the hotel.  It is a bit of a walk from the closest blue line stop to the hotel though so be prepared to walk.  There are buses that you can take from the blue line stop to the hotel though, but I didn't try that option.  The red line stop is much closer to the hotel.   Sight-seeing:  The hotel is in a great location.  If you don't mind a nice walk, you can walk to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Museums, etc.  The hotel is also a few train stops away from Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, parks, etc. Food:  The hotel is walking distance to many great restaurants.  Each night my bf and I would take a stroll to our restaurant of choice and walk back.  That options were endless.  The restaurants ranged from nice, pricey restaurants to economical down right grubbing restaurants.   Service:  The bellmen were super nice.  Always greeted the guests when they arrived or left the hotel..  Always willing to provide suggestions, give directions, etc.  The front desk personnel were a bit snobby.  I'm not sure if the attitude came with the motif of the hotel - green, boutique hotel, but I thought they could have been a bit more friendly.

When we finally got to the room, we opened the door to find a queen size bed & that was about it. The room was tiny and it took effort to fit between the walls & the bed. Reminded me more of a walk-in closet than a hotel room. The bathrooms were equally small with the smallest, most shallow sink that could be mistaken for a bird bath. Sleeping was more like playing ""Name that noise"" & we were on the 8th floor away from the elevators! The air conditioning was incredibly loud and woke us up every time it turned on.

I feel like I've heard so much hype about the place, maybe I had too high of an expectation. But when I finally went this weekend, I was pretty disappointed. 1) The crowd was mixed in terms of race and age, which I like. But the quality of the crowd was not so good in terms of looks. And I'm not trying to sound snobby or anything like that. Maybe it was just an off night, but it was a Saturday night, so I was hoping it was poppin' with some beautiful people. If you truly want to see some good looking people, go check out Y-Bar or Enclave. 2) So there was a good sized line, but we greased the bouncer some money to get in for our party (9 people: 5 girls, 4 guys). One of the bouncers flat out lied to our face saying there's cover so we need to pay him more. But when we asked the other bouncer, he was perplexed saying there is no cover for entrance. Oh, so I guess that's one of the positives. There's no cover. 3) When we finally got into the bar, we didn't feel it was that crowded. At least the line outside should have been moving a lot faster, but I guess that's how all bars/clubs work, trying to look like they're super busy. So I won't knock any points for that. 4) The outdoor bar section was pretty sharp.

Remember, you are in Chicago...if you wish to ride that same train there is a stop only a block away.  The comfort factor for the room is great, all the latest gadgets fit nicely on the workspace/desk, the bed is up to the new ""heavenly bed"" standards, bathroom is well set up (sink is a bit of a mistake, but shower, etc. are fine), and the TV has all the stations you could want.  Dined at both the restaurants and the food was outstanding (had the trout for dinner one night and breakfast every morning).  Prices are a little high-Hilton Diamond members get breakfast for free-so that's a plus.  Overnight parking was $45-again a little high for my taste, but the market rate for downtown Chicago.  Next time I may cab it everywhere and avoid that charge.  Given the location, you could also walk to plenty of attractions.  Rooftop bar was a scene worth checking out...even if it's not your scene.  Staff was very attentive, yes, they need some seasoning but they try hard so I give them high marks for that.  I will return sometime in the Fall, let's see if they get better at The Wit.";3;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w

They think that walking around patrolling the bar with their little secret service ear pieces make them feel more powerful, They are wrong about that, this give them a sense of power that they DO NOT have! We had been with some people that had been staying in the hotel that weekend. We had been ordering drinks and having an OK time, I then wanted to suggest a couple songs from the DJ ""Trentino"" AKA the Midget! who sucked By The Way! And then we had been quickly confronted by one of the security personal that obviously had napoleon complex and a power struggle complex, because he swiftly told me that I was not allowed near the DJ booth and he then proceeded to stand in front of me trying to be a jerk, He and the other security officers had starred me down and then shortly after this ordeal we had been taking pictures of our party and the security asked us why we had been taking so many pictures, like its a crime! And why we had been taking pictures of the security, like that's a crime as well! Then they gave us our check and proceeded to escort us out and that's when one of our party members wanted to know after we had spent a good deal of time there and lots of money why they thought that we should leave??? The security then became very aggressive and physical with one of the people in our party. This escalated to the security getting aggressive and then they physically started to push our friend who was staying at the hotel out of the bar, then after they had him in the hallway by the elevator 2 more security officers joined in the physical activity and proceeded to physically assault our friend which ended up physically harming our friend. They said that he was going to go to jail but they released him from their custody shortly after they had held him.

The base of the hotel was covered in groups of picketers with angry signs beating pots and pans. Once we made our way through the angry crowd, we found the lobby to be very impressive and immense. It took us a few minutes before we could locate the actual front desk that was up the escalator and on the second floor. Our room was on the Regency Level on the 34th floor with amazing views of the lake, Chicago River and the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable and the room was of a modern style. It was a nice looking room; however, it was pretty dusty. In the bathroom, the water pressure was so weak that it was a let down since they had such a nice looking shower. Another upsetting factor was that you could still hear the angry crowd from the street below banging their pans and shouting at all hours of the day from the 34th floor! It was horrible. The first night that we were there, we had a lady use a key card and enter our room (even with our privacy sign on the door) a bit after 10pm! We were in bed and were very shocked to find a person opening our room's door. We immediately called the front desk who then transferred me to security. About 20 or so minutes later, security arrived at our room to ""interrogate"" the lock. He said it was most likely a ""benign"" situation and probably housekeeping (after 10pm!?!). He fiddled with the lock and then disappeared without a final explanation to me and my husband. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well that night. With every noise we heard, we thought someone was coming in our room again. With us being unsure of housekeeping, or who ever was coming in our room, we decided to not have our room serviced during our stay. From the sound of it, they wouldn't have serviced it anyways. We spoke with another family in the building and they had been there three days waiting for someone to service their room. They were starting to make bets on whether or not their room would be clean each time they went back into their room. Basic cleanliness is a necessity for any hotel--it doesn't matter how large and how many rooms you have. In result of the picketers, more than half of the hotel restaurants were not in working order and were closed. In addition, there was no room service. We specifically chose a Hyatt hotel in the Chicago area so we would have restaurants close by since this was our first time to the city. This was a let down after flying from the West Coast. We decided to eat at the breakfast buffet on our second day and I would not recommend it. For the two of us, it cost $40 some dollars and the food was less than impressive. I only ate a third of a Denver omelet (the eggs were runny and the vegetables were crunchy), a piece of cantaloupe and some yogurt. Should have left the hotel for some real food for a fraction of the price! The proximity to sightseeing things and the ability to get a cab in a hurry is great. Just remember, you will have to walk through picketers to get in or out of the cars. All in all, we will not be returning nor will we recommend this hotel to anyone--family, friend or stranger. I actually joined yelp to share this story because I know how important reviews are and people should know this hotel is having some major issues.

A roll out bed for $200+ per night. There were no lights on the side of the bed so one had to get up everytime and go the the lights at the corner of the room to switch them on/off. All night, there was periodic slamming noise come out just outside my door after every 30 mins or so. I was too tired to find out and just wanted to get a night's rest.

The room has a great view of Michigan Ave. The first room I had was on the third floor as well. It was very cold and I had to call the front desk and they mentioned the heat was not turned on and mentioned they will bring me a portable heater and small blanket. It took a very long time to receive the heater and extra blanket and I had to be at a meeting; so I left and when I returned to the room the heater was sitting on the dresser and extra blanket on the bed. When I attempted to take a shower there was no hot water nor warm water. I had another meeting soon and I needed to shower so I went downstairs and spoke with the manager and she changed my room to the ninth floor. As I entered the new room I noticed a big difference. The bed was a California King from a King in the room on the third floor. The furniture was newer and nicer and the new room actually had a desk and the room was bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking. The bed are still generic brand that I never heard of and the bed is not that comfortable where you can feel the springs and the linen is scratchy. The television channels are basic and the Internet is Ethernet and cost $9.99 a night. No microwave. No fridge. The heat works in this room. If your room faces Michigan Ave or the Lake you will feel the Windy City through your windows. In the new room the water takes a while to become warm and never turned hot and the water was brown at first as well. I believe it's time for my investor friends or any investor to come along and buy the Congress Hotel and tear it down like a old hotel on the Vegas strip and build a new one. Wasting renovations on the current hotel is not helping and giving 20% spring discounts for a rate of $79 per night does not assist me wanting to stay another night!

If it were up to its full potential, I would have to pay two or three times the rate, as you might expect to pay for a room in the Gold Coast or on the river.  But at the minimum, it is in need of new carpeting and better housekeeping.  I didn't feel comfortable walking anywhere in the room bare-foot.  The complimentary breakfast was mediocre, and the food servers were friendly but not terribly professional or efficient.   On a positive note, the location is great for tourists.  Bus lines, taxis and trains are all within easy walking distance, and it's right in the middle of the great museums and parks.  I would say it's a good location for the beginner who would like to see the more popular attractions, just bring flip-flops and spend the extra money and have your breakfast in a cafe nearby.I would not rule out the possibility of staying there again, but if I can find a comparable rate for a place in a geographically desireable location, I'll look at it.";3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

Despite of all the inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room.

I had my passport & $300 cash so I figured I'd be fine for the weekend. When checkinginto The Congress, I was told by the  clerk that my online reservation was for only 1 night. I apologized & explained that I left my wallet (with CCs) at home.I offered several options for me to pay for the remaining 2 nights: Paypal, wire transfer, or calling a friend who can pay for the room with their CC. The clerk said  ""I have to talk with my manager."" The manager comes out & tells the clerk that I have to check out tomorrow. The manager didn't discuss the issue with me. Basically, he didn't try to find an acceptable solution . In the Morning :Called a friend to make an online payment on hotel website. Payment accepted. I feel the matter is resolved. I left my hotel room for  breakfast. Returning to my room, I discover that my room card is deactivated. I go to the front desk & was told that the hotel canceled the online payment because it wasn't paid with my  CC.ME: You got to be kidding me?!MANAGER: We can't accept payment if we don't have the CC holder info.ME: The payment was accepted and then you canceled it?  How would you like me to pay for the room?MANAGER: You can call your friend & ask him to fax a copy of the back/front of his CC, driver license & letter stating  he authorizes the payment.ME: Fine.Call to friend:  I explained what the manager is requesting.FRIEND: OMG...I have my kids  I can't do that right now.ME: Okay, don't worry; I'll call someone else.I  reach another friend, explain the situation, and ask him for help. He  has to drive to his office for a fax machine. After 45 minutes, my friend calls me & says that all the  docs have been faxed to the hotel.ME: Did you receive fax from my friend?MANAGER: Yes.I called my friend to thank him, so he leaves the office.  5 minutes later the manager returns & tells me he needs another faxed copy of the CC, because the back of the CC is not signed & a CC authorization form has to be completed.  I'm now frustrated & say ""You couldn't tell me that the first time? My friend left his office.I called my friend back, ""Sorry my man! ...FRIEND: I left the office!  @#* &*!!!!!!!!!. Why didn't they tell you this before..?ME : I'm sorry but they're threatening to kick me out of the hotel, I don't have my wallet, my cash is running out...I truly need your help.FRIEND: OkMANAGER: I received the letter but it didn't note the precise amount for full payment of the hotel stay & it doesn't have the signature on the fax. ME TO MY FRIEND: The clerk says she doesn't have the fax with your signature.FRIEND: I sent it. The clerk was misspoke about not receiving the letter with my friend's signature. The manager comes out & says ""I have it, but the signature on the CC & on the letter isn't the same. At this point, I lose my temper & started to scream. I said to the manager ""Put yourself in my situation.  I've proposed several different payment options, none of which you accepted; I have contacted 2 friends, both of whom made payment for this reservation but you canceled both payments...and you expect me be calm?!  I've been down here for two hours trying to resolve this issue!""MANAGER: Sir, you are making a scene.

2444;7/12/2011;nWfoQrV4iZktl3GYkefydg;HhinNHoXCdxo28uuiS0vxQ;"I stayed in this hotel last night, and felt compelled to write a review. I was at the hotel on business for one night. Upon arriving I was struck by the nostalgic feel. I said to myself ""this place must have some great history"", and went to the Internet. First thing that came up was that it was haunted. Great. I'm not into that kind of stuff and have no desire to experience it, so quickly became less enthused with the prospect of staying there. It was already 10:30 PM though so I didn't have a lot of choice. First, the hotel itself: I was greeted warmly by the check-in staff, and enjoyed chatting with her. I was put on the 10th floor of the south tower. I had no problems with the elevators whatsoever. The corridors looked vintage; it was like a flashback in time. Kinda cool. Ditto for when I entered the room. It had a classic look to it: crown molding that had been over painted through the years, older wallpaper but which had the hotel's logo, a pedestal sink in the bath. Certainly nothing fancy but at the same time everything you need. Ample work space, a flat screen tv mounted on the wall, and the bed was a little hard but nothing bad. My view of the lake was spectacular. The only problem I had was the noise from the street. It was a Monday night but there seemed to be a lot of vehicle activity. Busses, trucks, loud motorcycles, cars with their radio jamming, the L-train. I heard it all until around 2:00AM or so, which surprised me a bit since I was on the 10th floor. So did I see any paranormal activity? Nothing I saw, but two times just as I was drifting off to sleep I hear the faucet in the bathroom start for 5 seconds or so and then turn off. The first time I layer there frozen. I started to drift off again and about an hour later I heard it again. This time sprang out of bed, ran to the bathroom and turned off the light. I saw nothing. I took a towel and dried out the sink; if it happened again and I went in there and it was wet, then I would know for sure something was up. It didn't happen again. So I will let you make up your own mind as to what it was, but I am 99% sure that it wasn't the toilet running or coming from another room. In short, it freaked me out a bit. In summary, I thought it was a nice hotel that just felt kinda dead. There just weren't a lot of people there and the place felt empty. Of course it was a Monday night. Anyway, I won't stay there again, but solely because of the whole haunted thing. I'm just not into that. If that doesn't bother you then I would go for it. It's a nice slice of history situated in a great location.";3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

She upgraded my room on the spot and advised that she would do her best to upgrade (at check-in) to a lakeview room - which she did! Once we were there, the beauty of the hotel just knocked me out! From the lobby to the gold elevators to the room itself (with a lakeview and of course the view of The Taste) were fantastic!! Location was the biggest plus - it was just perfect!! Yes it's an older hotel but I think that adds to the beauty. Yes, they say it's haunted but we didn't experience any of that - too bad, might have been cool. And yes, there were picketers but they didn't bother me in the least. The only warning I would have is that parking in the garage behind the hotel can cost you $28 - $33 per day. All in all, I will go back again and again!";5;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

We have done NUMEROUS weddings at various 4 and 5-star hotels within Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, so we had a certain expectation. Let me first off say that the banquet halls where the wedding was held were beautiful-the decor, the flowers, everything. HOWEVER...we were told by the hotel management that we could leave our personal belongings in a specific place at the hotel (which we always do), so that we could work and not worry about our stuff. After a few hours, we came back to find that the wallets of the 5 girls with whom I work (including myself) had been opened and all of our money had been STOLEN along with an iPhone! No guests had access to this room-it was only hotel staff. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM AT ANY OTHER HOTEL!!! I was completely disgusted. This is a hotel that claims to uphold a certain ""standard"", but they have apparently no requirements for when hiring people. To make matters worse, when we filed complaints with the security manager, he told us that ""plenty of help gets hired for the day of any wedding and they're not actual employees of The Drake"". Basically taking away any and all responsibility from the situation....I was completely APPALLED.It's not even the hundreds of dollars that were taken, but rather the principle of the matter. Coming to a hotel like the Drake, you expect a certain degree of professionalism from the staff and you certainly don't expect someone to violate you the way that we had been. As someone who has worked and attended a LOT of upscale elaborate weddings, I will NEVER recommend anyone to come to the Drake.

We NEVER saw any signs because we used the valet at the hotel. While $20 isn't that much money it still left us with a bad taste in our mouths about the hotel. This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, but the bathrooms were very small. It's an older hotel so a lot of things weren't up to date.

First off, the hotel looks NOTHING LIKE THE ONLINE PICTURE and it tooks us 3 trips around the block to find the place because there was a small sign above the door. The valet was inside; no one to help us with our luggage. The desk clerk was about as friendly as a rock. We were on the 24th floor with a view of buildings-I had asked for a nice view for my grandaughter; couldn't change us. Cold air was pouring in the windows and the furnace never stopped blowing hot/cold air. The bathroom was a small joke; no fan and one plug. They didn't change the towels either and I had put them in the tub dirty. Very dark in the room and very few channels on the tv and 2 plugs for stuff. The rest were behind the bed and the dresser. The water was lukewarm with no pressure in the shower. Breakfast the next morning at the Sky Lounge was a huge expensive mistake. No postings, a small buffet with warm, dry food, a toaster that didn't work, no tables for more than 2 people so we had to sit on the couch and chair and balance food on our laps. My grandaughter had spiderwebs in her blueberries. I was charged for a juice I did not order. So we had eggs, meat, 2 thin slices of melon, 2 ordered juices (3) and  they gave us the bill -it was over $59- and we about fainted.The next morning we ate at the pub downstairs for about $20. The food was much better and the waiter at least smiled. When I complained I got the 'I'll tell the cook' which means 'whatever lady'. When we check out, again no valet around, he couldn't understand that we wanted our car; he kept trying to get us a cab. He finally told us the car was ready. Again no luggage help and it was at their garage around the corner that we had to walk to dragging all of our luggage. At least the attendant there helped us put it in the car. I've had better luck at the Holiday Inn. Yes I tried to complain but either no one was at the desk or they were so busy talking to one another they completely ignored us and other guests. I'm going back to the Hyatt. We spent $444- 2 nights with 2 queen beds, 2 nights parking at $48 per night and the breakfast. We took a 'shellacking' as Obama said.";1;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

2485;7/7/2012;XMYlAGg5RS_yU-pwJpKO-g;M0vDHXMIZbo_LTzCXOzS9g;"I stayed there for two days this week and I have to say my expectations were much higher. I stay in Chicago quite often for business and pleasure, and this was my first time at the Allerton. Sure, the location was great as many point out, but there are countless other hotels in the area. A couple of blocks takes at most a few minutes to walk, and in the end, staying the night at another hotel would be much better.The hotel staff was friendly enough and my experience with them was positive. The downsides of the hotel greatly outweigh whatever positives the employees and location provide. First off, the rooms are incredibly tiny. Sure, it's the city, but I've never been in a room so small in Chicago. Secondly, my room was actually dirty. The bedsheets had sand in them when I went to sleep, and I'm guessing someone got a sandy towel stuck with the laundry that day. However, the maid should have noticed the sheets were dirty when she put them on the bed. There was also mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, something I've never seen in a hotel at this price point. Finally, I had purchased a park and play package, and never received the ""play"" part of the deal, which was supposed to include a welcome kit and free wi-fi. Instead, I was told I needed to purchase wi-fi, the packages starting at $10. What really was the worst part of the experience was the bed and the ""valet"" parking. When coming to the city, I look forward to getting a good rest on a nice mattress. The mattress at the Allerton was horrible. I've never had a problem at any hotel I've stayed at in the city. The mattresses are thin and old, so old in fact that you can feel the springs when you lay down on it! I woke up incredibly sore, from my back to my neck. I would equate the beds to something you would find at a Red Roof Inn! I did not pay almost $200/night for that. As far as the valet parking goes, avoid it at ALL costs. When I picked my car up before leaving, it took them over 30 minutes to bring me my car. I thought valet parking wasn't supposed to be a headache?! The parking allows for ""come and go"" access, meaning once they park you, you can come in and out of the parking garage throughout your stay. I can't imagine wasting a half hour of my time each time I wanted to leave!I wanted to like the Allerton, but I just can't. I love the decor, and it's very modern and clean. The did a great job on that end. I'm not normally picky, but for the price I was expecting much more. I normally don't complain about hotels (it might seem like it in this review), but I have never been so disappointed. Would I stay here if the price was lower? Yes.

The bellman was helpful in assisting with the few questions I did have, though.  Check-in/out was fine.  We had no problem leaving our bags with the bellmen when we arrived early/before check-in or after check-out.  They were able to retrieve our bags quickly with no issues.  We had a standard king room and it was very small.  I don't mind a small room, but I was surprised by how small it the room was.  The TV was nice, there was a desk, the bed looked nice with white bedding and navy piping.  The closet was tiny, but again, we were only staying for 1 night, so not a big deal.  I think these accommodations are ok for a night or weekend, but I would have been cramped had I been staying for an extended period of time (a week or more).  I have read this before, and I will have to agree 100% that the sheets are extremely rough and scratchy!  My husband and I both commented on the low quality sheets, which was disappointing.  I think nice sheets can make such a huge difference in a hotel.  I slept well despite the scratchy sheets.  The pillows were soft and comfy.A word of warning: THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN!!!!  During the day I heard the man in the room next to us talking on his cell phone.  He was speaking with a normal tone/volume and I could hear the entire conversation very clearly, as if he was in the room.  That being said, we woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of our neighbors...!  WHOA!  They weren't even that loud, it was honestly that the walls were incredibly thin.  Eeek.The bathroom was small and had a pedestal sink, no counter space, and a more industrial looking toilet with the flush handle similar to a commercial toilet (it's an old hotel).  The shower was nice, the marble was nice, and the shower head was actually pretty good and provided decent water pressure and a rainfall spray.  The toiletries were limited and included a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion.  They smelled pleasant, but I would have appreciated a shower cap and maybe a body wash.   The towels were fine, they got me dry, but they were quite standard.  I guess if you have more toiletries and more luxury towels, the price of the room would just go up, so again, it's what your priorities are, right? I think the hotel, the room, and the bathroom appeared to be clean, but not spotless.  If I had been staying for more than 1 night I would have expected more in the way of cleanliness.Overall, I would say this hotel is average - convenient location, nice , but old.   Allerton is definitely not a boutique or luxury hotel, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed (note that this review is based on a standard king and I am unable to provide an opinion on any upgraded rooms they may offer). We were comfortable and didn't have any major issues or complaints.   I think just having softer, higher quality sheets could make a huge difference in the experience, though.  People don't always use the other amenities in a hotel (desk, TV, closet, etc.) but they almost always need a comfortable place to rest (with silky sheets!)  We probably won't stay here again, because there are so many other options and I'm not opposed to spending a little more for a true luxury hotel.";2;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Before booking, we were told that the Allerton Hotel lists itself as a ""business"" hotel with strong wi fi capabilities. This was extremely important to us when booking as we run a company that relies on the ability to upload time sensitive large files while traveling. Upon first arrival, when we realized that the advertised wi fi speed was far below the ACTUAL wi fi speed, we spoke with a manager who gave us the run around, finally transferring us to the internet service provider outside of the hotel. After hours of waiting (and losing precious time), we had gotten nowhere and had to resort to looking into other options with no help from the hotel. Finally, we ran tests via http://testmy.net and were surprised to find that the connection was running 98% LOWER than the average internet connection speed. The hotel staff was clueless, the internet provider couldn't reset the server because their system was FROZEN, and our business trip was RUINED. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU NEED TO USE THE INTERNET. ALSO, there was a PILE of dust in the corner of the room near the television - clearly the staff thinks what you don't see at first glance does not need to be cleaned.

Gross.Totally not a 4 star hotel as advertised on Hotwire and the rooms were smaller than any place we've stayed even in NYC or Rome. And parking is $50 a night.

They give you a lot of space between the hall where the elevators let you out & then there was an extra room for the cocktail hour so that was nice. Lighting should have been  dimmer to support the romantic ambiance of a wedding, but some of the older guests probably appreciated the bright lights.Food was good, staff was fun and upbeat, & we had a great ole time in the bar downstairs before we went up to the reception at 630.

We saw one business guy almost blow a gasket while he was waiting in a long line to check out though!If you're wanting your wedding there like the previous post, just know that it's an old historic hotel and the bar has to be outside the ballroom due to space, but if your guests want a drink, they'll find the bar! I'm a good friend of the bride's  & the organizing of her reception was probably a little more stressful than it should have been for the amount of money they spent!  Sound system needs some improvement too, but city views out the windows were SPECTACULAR, and it's really the guests made the reception a great one.I'd stay there again.Oh, my husband said to write that he liked the butter in the restaunt. Waiter & busboy were exceptionally attentive. Hubby thought  steak was a little small but he's a bit of a glutton so take that with a grain of salt.!";4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I started to think I made a big mistake. Well, I am pleased to say that not only did I NOT make a mistake, I couldn't have been HAPPIER with my decision. My daughter and I had a small suite with a king bed. Yes, these rooms are a bit smaller but really people...this is an old hotel! The room was neat and clean and due to the fact that we were staying a week I was able to request a small fridge to keep snacks and drinks. The front desk staff was polite and on point, check in was a snap and requests were fulfilled promptly. I decided to try room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised...the food was great and well worth the price for the quantity. The last two nights of our stay my husband showed up to surprise my daughter and we were even able to get a roll-away bed for her. We didn't even notice that is was there since it fit right into the sitting area of our suite. Each time we went out and needed travel assistance the guys downstairs were more then willing to give directions, recommendations and then ensure that we had a cab right away. A BIG thank you goes to each and everyone of you who made my daughters stay ( I say that because all of her friends were at a different hotel for the National Honor Choir) in Chicago everything she could have wished for and more. She loved telling everyone that she was staying at the Allerton and that they should have too!";5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

However, the hotel shares a flaw with many of the hotels in which I've stayed in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities: size. The rooms looked a lot bigger on http://www.getaroom.com, and the lobby itself seemed rather small. Also, the elevators (these were small too) were beyond confusing. You have to go up to the 3rd floor to then get on another elevator? I've never seen that before. The hotel isn't perfect, but you get what you pay for.

The lobby is something akin to a W hotel decorated in white and the staff has been incredibly warm and welcoming (even when I arrived at 8am wondering if I could have an early check-in). Rooms have a nod to old-hollywood with whites and creams, crystal and black accents yet retain a modern edge.Some things you need to know:1. The restaurant doesn't serve dinner, but you can get small snacks in the bar until 112. Room service stops at 11 (not so good for night owls like me)3. Free wi-fi in the bar, restaurant and lobby but $10 a day in your room4. No mini-bar in roomMy room was really, really tiny. Boston boutique hotel tiny... but stylish and comfy bed. The bathroom left quite a bit to be desired from the lighting and motel-8 quality towels to the icy marble walls, floor and shower. The best thing about the bathroom are the L'Occtaine products they provide.I did have appetizers and wine in the bar, all were extraordinary. The menu is ambitious and creative and completely delivers. Surveying other plates around me I could see lots of tempting choices! Staff in the bar/lounge were exceptional.Location is excellent for shopping mag mile - it's next door to Neiman Marcus, across the street from Saks and about half way between Macy's @ Watertower Place and Nordstrom.My job is all travel, so I spend many, many nights in hotels. This is a good value for the location and general ambiance. Not high-end luxury, but not budget either. Could work for travel or a fun getaway.

Rooms are small, and the bathrooms are the smallest I have seen, but when you consider you are right next to a 5 star hotel and you are paying hundreds of dollars less,  the Chicago Essex Inn will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago. All rooms are nicely appointed, and if you can afford the upgrade to the King Suite, you will not be disappointed by the space and the view. We experienced very hot temperatures (100 degrees) on one of the days, and the A/C in the banquet hall facing the east, just could not keep up. Fans were required, which were offered. The lobby is clean and neatly appointed, and I understand it will undergo renovation after the current tourist summer season. A best kept secret is the 4th floor open air garden patio with excellent view up and down Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The pool and weight room will satisfy almost anybody.

I've stayed here a few times in the past few years and each time I've been impressed. I've even been impressed when I wasn't a guest here. Everyone-- from the doormen to the front desk to the cleaning ladies to the fitness room attendants to the concierge-- have been always been accommodating and professional.  It was here where I first learned what concierges did. I used to walk by hotel concierges and wonder what the heck they did all day. At the W Lakeshore, they do everything! They make rental car reservations if you want to drive out to the 'burbs, mail letters even if you don't have a stamp, reserve tables at popular restaurants--the whole shebang! Once I wandered into the W when I wasn't staying there, all lost and wind-shocked, and the concierge looked up the restaurant I was trying to get to and gave me directions. Now that's service.  The rooms are a little on the small side, but the view of the lake more than makes up for it. At a lot of hotels with supposed lake views, you can only see the lake way, way off in the distance. At the W, however, you can take a shower, open the divider between the bathroom and bedroom, and all you see is water when you look out the window. Now that's priceless. As a much-appreciated security precaution, you have to insert your room card to use the elevators. The hotel exercise room has nice equipment, but I usually just run along the lakeshore path because it's right across the street. The complimentary Bliss products are a little too citrusy-smelling for my liking, but that's just a preference thing. I can't comment on the restaurant or bars because I've never tried them, but the bar/lounge/restaurant area on the first floor is full of people in stylish clothes at night so I'm assuming it'd be a good place to pick up people if that's your thing. Tip: If you're part of the Starwood Preferred Guest program, you get early check-in and late check-out (4PM!!!!), even if you didn't book the room through the Starwood website. Also, most hotel programs don't give you reward points if book through an outside party, but I've gotten about 50-60 SPG points per stay in the past (which, admittedly, is basically nothing but still appreciated).";5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The entire lobby turned into a night club on most evenings during my stay.  It was a lively scene, and I found that my colleagues were all eager to participate.  We tried the restaurant ""Wave"" for lunch and dinner and I would highly recommend it.  I sampled many of the dishes from the tapas-style menu and they were excellent, including hummus, spinach and feta pastries, flank steak, and octopus.    The hotel is conveniently located a few short blocks from Michigan ave with it's fantastic shops and restaurants.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would probably stay here again.";4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The floor was very dirty and had some stains on it.  The Wi-Fi, which you have to pay for only worked about 25% of the time.  And their tech support was no help for that.  On the plus side, while the bathroom is snug the shower pressure was awesome.  The king size bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. There was an evening manager's reception with a free drink and snacks (chips and veggies).  And the breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room.  The drawback to that was if you did not go first thing, the breakfast area was overrun with mobs of young families.

I stayed at the James on Monday of this week and after a long day at the office, I really appreciated the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk.

It was great for finishing up some work at night in a more relaxing environment. Wifi was free, they offer a nice high-tech ""Dream Machine"" alarm clock with audio like rain and beach sounds to put you to sleep + an ipod deck in the mini kitchen. I checked out their GYM and was really impressed to see the sheer size and number of machines and equiptment, also opened 24 hours. Their bath products were all natural and high-quality (can't recall the name) and the shower was very clean, which I have noticed is NOT standard at many pretty high-end hotels.

I recently stayed in a standard king room at the James, at a rate of $170. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants/food. You're within easy walking distance to the Oak Street area as well as regular Magnificent Mile shopping. Plus a short walk to the river. David Burke is the hotel restaurant, Grahamwich is around the corner, and across the street are Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and a gourmetish deli.- Overall decor is fresh, modern, clean.- Quiet rooms.- Friendly staff- Parking is expensive but if you go north just a couple of blocks on Rush there's $30/day parking (however it is not easy in/out).Cons:- At 3 pm my room wasn't ready and the staff person tried to upsell me another room at a higher rate. On the plus side, they took my number and called me when the room was ready.- The carpet in the room is odd: it has a higher pile than you see in most hotel rooms, and it's brown, so it appears to be dirty and dingy.- The bathroom was small but easy, modern and convenient. Kiehl's soaps and lotions. The bathroom lacked a fan (or else it was so oddly placed that it couldn't be found), which meant that there was a slightly damp or dank smell to the room. Not a huge deal by any means, but something I noticed.- This one is kind of weird but there's a huge, fluorescent light fixture directly above the bed, placed right above where one's head rests on the pillows. I thought this was so strange! It kind of made me paranoid that the fixture would fall on me. Not that it looked loose or anything. Just the placement - right over the head - was a little unnerving. Your own paranoia may vary.Finally, be aware that the hotel is not completely non-smoking; a few of the floors are for smokers.

It was nice having 2 bathrooms. There were two major disappointments with the room. First, there was no mini fridge. I don't think I've ever stayed in a room without one. Second of all, there was one vent for the air conditioning to come in, and it wasn't very effective. We tried turning the air down to cool off the room, and the coolest setting it would go to was 64 degrees. But the room never cooled off below like 76.

The location was good, and with the supposed floor to ceiling windows that opened for a fabulous city view, we thought it would be a great spot.1. The windows are not floor to ceiling as advertised, and they only open about 3 inches. We really had no city view at all, since the inside of the windows were iced over for almost our entire stay. I live in the Midwest where it gets quite cold, but my windows never ice on the inside...2. As a result of this ice issue, the room was FREEZING. I am a person who sleeps in shorts and a tank top in the middle of Nebraska winters with the fan on. In this room, I was in pants, long sleeves, buried under the covers, and still freezing cold. All this while the heater was set on 77 degrees. 3. You'll realize how ridiculous 77 degrees is when you realize the room is tiny. I've stayed in Super 8s with bigger rooms. I must say, they take flattering photos for their advertisements! The room really was way too small. The restroom was tiny. Thank goodness I am a small person, because I don't know how anyone too much bigger could even get in the room enough to shut the door. 4. Our ""city view"" was none other than a view of a busy road and some crappy roofs. We could not see the skyline from our room. So how they can sell this view for an extra price is beyond me. 5. Not all of our TV channels worked. This created a problem since it was bowl week, and the channels that didn't work were channels showing games. The staff could not have cared less, and never offered any help other than suggesting we ""go to the bar"" to watch the games. Coincidence? 6. 24 hours of internet service is 15 bucks. We were charged for 2 days even though we only used one. To make matters more irritating, the Marriott homepage somehow became all 12 of my ""favorites"" on my Mac. Even when I got home and cleared my history, it continued to pop up. I don't know if they installed some kind of cookies or what, but they messed up my computer. It was a mess getting it set back the way it was.7. Leaving was a mess. We called the front desk and ask if they had a booking/reservation process for guests that needed to retrieve their vehicles from valet. They said no, and that it would only take 10 minutes. Yeah, right. We waited almost 45 minutes to get our car back.  So, unless you're leaving at 7 am, plan for it to take forever to get your vehicle upon checking out. I would not stay at the location again. Its location may be ""convenient"" but it's little else.

The view is spectacular, our head table was decorated beautifully, the food tasted great, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure our guests were pleased! Our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery (which is included in your wedding package) came out exactly how we envisioned it, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever had. Our bridal suite had an amazing view and it was huge! Our entire night at the Holiday Inn was perfect and I would highly recommend meeting with Barbara Martin if you are planning a wedding or event in the Chicagoland area!";5;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

Barbara Martin is an outstanding wedding coordinator - she's organized, knows how to handle brides (and mothers of brides) with ease and she is always happy to provide suggestions, recommendations or advice to help with the wedding planning process. This was the perfect place for a Chicago wedding - you can't beat the city skyline and the river as seen from the windows in the Wolf Point Ballroom!

After looking at all the pictures online and reading reviews, we were excited to stay here. The hotel did not disappoint. Upon reaching the hotel we were amazed by the gorgeous exterior. The hotel itself is a beauty. The inside is equally as stunning. The lobby area was very pretty and we really liked the long fireplace. Its a small lobby compared to other hotels, but it was extremely opulent and pretty. I guess we stayed in the basic room and I was really impressed. The floors are hardwood - I don't know why more hotels don't convert to this. It makes the place feel a lot cleaner and open. The bathroom is extremely large - maybe a little too large. There is a big bathtub and a big separate shower. The weird thing about the bathroom was there were no towel hooks or racks? This made it tricky to reuse towels or even just keep things looking tidy. The bed was comfy and they gave you plenty of pillows. I think there were over 8! There was also a large closet area with shelving inside. In terms of location, it was a little out of the way of Michigan Ave, but maybe that makes it more appealing. It wasn't loud in the area and its a short walk to Milennium Park (and the bean!) or to Michigan Ave. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant.I do recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a splurge compared to the other hotels in the area, but its a great place to treat yourself.

This time we were put in a corner room overlooking the outdoor pool and walkway path.  This room is definitely brighter than the last room we stayed in since it had huge windows everywhere, outside balconies and full hardwood floors.  We also had a direct view of Navy Pier and were able to see the lights at the pier at night.  Just beautiful.  The room is huge and has a separate area for working with a small tv, desk and refrigerator/stocked bar in it.  This room also had a shower and tub we used nightly.  The tub was really large and deep.  Their beds and pillows are awesome and so soft.  The best part of the rooms are that they are extremely quiet and you never hear people walking through the hallway, EVER.  The weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outside area.  We went for a walk on the pathway that goes around the whole building and were pleasantly surprised by the sponge walkway.  If you are a jogger it will definitely keep you from jarring your legs!  We ate at Filini restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner during our stays and have loved every meal we have been served.  We have eaten at many restaurants and Filini definitely is one of our favorites. The meals are excellent, gourmet and priced very typical of a Chicago restaurant.  When you sit down they bring cheese and bread to snack on while waiting for your meal.  The bar is our favorite also.  They have huge booths for groups and the bar is just inviting and very beautiful.  We had appetizers and drinks and the appetizers were extremely good.  We had the marinated olives, meatballs and eggplant parmesan.  Everything was seasoned perfect and perfect size for an appetizer.  We love to get a drink from the bar and then go to the lounge area with the full length fireplace.  The couches make you want to lay down and sleep they are so comfortable and cozy.  The staff we encountered are always nice and very helpful.  Bob, the doorman is always on task and available in a second.  We pick this hotel due to how beautiful and comfortable the whole hotel is.  Usually something suffers somewhere but there are no issues that I have found with this hotel.  This hotel is placed perfectly for walking tourists.  We were able to get to all the areas such as Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue within 15 -20 minutes.

2608;1/26/2010;MyBj7GLUGxAnioybW6-tYQ;fyPDwhIVTlvuOPZnT7v_Dg;"***Had to come back and comment. I just called the hotel and simply asked that they refund just one night of the three due to no water. They graciously complied. So it's all good. However, I just read a lot of people's complaints and most of them repeat the same thing, about having no water. So it's not an isolated incident. Obviously the W wouldn't have a hotel with no water or un-reliable water supply, so it must be something connected with the loop area of Chicago where the water simply gets shut off periodically.. I bet if they'd known that they would not have even opened up a hotel there in the first place. Imagine, a hotel where you can never rely on having water!I just had an out of town guest who is our business partner stay here for 3 nights because it's close to our offices. We were searching for a new hotel to bring all of our business guests to, and that's about 5 guests a month, plus or minus a few and also our satellite employees who visit once a month.First morning, our business partner gets up and there is NO WATER AT ALL. There was no water until almost noon. And then it was cold water. He had to keep calling over and over. When I came to pick him up, they said a boiler had broken (no emergency back up apparantly) and by the time they fixed it etc. The woman said ""keep running the water and it will get warm"". It didn't. No shower.  At minimum they should have jumped and said ""oh my God, let us move you to a different room immediately, we'll get your things"". Instead they kept discussing the issue instead of alerting the guest since they knew about it, handling it with a room move, and refunding the night. Just the one night, more than that would have been unfair.This morning, before he checked out, the best they could do was luke-warm water.  They did send beautiful chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of middle of the road champagne and gave me 8000 starwoods points, odd since I don't have a Starwood account. But frankly, they should have refunded that one night. You go to a hotel with the expectation that you will be able to shower and clean up after your travels. I am recommending to our company to strike them off the list for the way this issue was handled. It should have been a no-brainer ""we are refunding the one night""  but I guess strawberries and a 5 dollar bottle of champagne are easier.";2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Standard room was WAY to small. Our king-size bed took up most of the standing room. Forget about using the ironing board...You practically have to stand on your head! Luckily my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and really didn't mind the close quarters...Had we been there for more than two nights, or had there been ONE more person in the room, it could have gotten pretty ugly. 2). The fitness center was nice and had a variety of equipment, but only 2/4 treadmills worked. In a hotel that size, it was totally inadequate. 3) The walls are tissue-paper thin. I was in the hallway, a full five doors away from our room and I could hear my husband's telephone conversation quite clearly despite the fact that he was speaking in a regular tone of voice. 4)  An in-room coffee pot has become a standard amenity at most hotels...*ahem... Did someone forget to mention that to the staff at the Allegro? 5) Speaking of beverages, where did they hide all the vending machines? Oh yeah, they don't have any. I guess this is to ensure that we'll purchase the high-priced drinks/snacks from the in-room ""wet bar"". The wine hour didn't make up for it either, since we don't drink alcohol. I suggest you take a stash of pop if you're in the same boat.  6) Word of caution: Even though it's located in a great place, surrounding restaurants tend to close early...maybe because everyone heads to the theaters? Don't get caught hungry after about 6 pm. Your choices will be severely limited unless you want to get a cab.Finally, would we stay again?

People were falling down drunk in the halls. We stayed in our room literally fearing gunfire would erupt , I'm not making this up.  We will never go back to Hotel 71.

This is a 36 floor tower with hundreds of rooms! There are few good things to say about Hotel 71 other then it's location, right on Wacker and close to everything including local transportation. Given that we spent little time at the hotel, it served our purposes. We booked a three night stay at appx. $130.00 a night and requested a top floor and river view, which was excellent.  The room was decorated but sparse - insufficient writing desk with poor lighting, no pad or pens provided, cheap do it yourself coffee service on desk. Nice settee and the king bed was comfy and clean, I inspected for signs of bedbugs and found none, thankfully, but always check any hotel room immediately. Blankets and pillows were slightly upscale. Bathroom was supplied with minimal soap and shampoo, and threadbare towels, barely meeting cheap motel standards. And your closet is in the bathroom!Hotel 71 has major problems.  First the lobby -- there is none. Think I'm kidding? - try finding a photo of the Hotel 71 lobby; well yes there is a smallish bare bones seating area in front of the front desk but that's it, frankly I've seen better lobbies at the cheapest Motel 6. This carries over to the ""bar - dining area"" bare floor with IKEA style seating that has all the comfort and charm of a bus station at night. Clearly there is a cultural disconnect between Hotel 71 ownership and the expectations of the clients.  However, we were not expecting to spend anytime at the hotel so for us, no problem but your expectations may not be met. But the problems went deeper. Only 2 elevators serve the upper floors and one was out and remained unrepaired over the entire time - making the trip up to the 36th floor more of a commute then an elevator ride. This is unacceptable. It's a shame that the friendly and caring staff are stuck in a physical building that is far from welcoming as possible. Stay here midweek if you need the central location and do not expect to spend anytime here. Do not even THINK about staying here if hotel accommodations and comfort are an important part of your travel plans.";2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

We had lucked out.

Check in wasn't until 3 but we arrived around 2 and were able to get to our room. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and she gave us a room away from the elevators on a high floor. Our room also had a view of lake Michigan which was a very nice surprise. The room was beautiful, the king sized bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was completely new...which leads me to why I give this hotel 4 stars. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door and it wasn't installed properly. There is a sizable gap, and you can see right into the bathroom. That's fine if you're staying alone, not so much with a traveling companion. You can also hear EVERYTHING that happens in the bathroom, including what your neighbors are doing if you catch my drift.

When we checked in (at 5:15 p.m.) we were informed that the previous night's guests had checked out late so the room was not clean. They kindly provided us with drink vouchers and we settled in to the martini bar to wait for what we assumed would be a reasonable amount of time. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER I revisited the desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that the previous night's guests actually hadn't checked out until 45 MINUTES AFTER we had arrived at 6 p.m. (check in is listed at 3 p.m.). This was directly in conflict with the previous statement that ""housecleaning is in the room cleaning it right now."" Despite checking in at 5 p.m. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE ROOM UNTIL 7:30 p.m. (four and a half hours after we were supposed to be able to check in). Hotel staff could only say ""sorry, we really have no control over when guests leave."" What?!  While we were waiting, three other guests came to the desk with assorted other complaints. The hotel room phones did not work so we had to use cell phones to call the front desk. Staff noted that they did not work but did not come to fix them until we were checking out the next day. In addition, we had to ask three times for extra beverage glasses (which took a half an hour to show up), and had to request linens for the fold out bed as well. Speaking with upper management the day after was less than delightful. They did agree to deduct a small portion of the room price, but only after repeated complaints and difficulty. The hotel is lovely with lots of character. Too bad the same cannot be said for the management. . .

So, we enjoyed a cab ride across town to the Allegro. The hotel they sent us to only had rooms with one king bed - no doubles. So, we had to have the desk person at the new hotel barter with the Millennium to get them to provide us with enough beds to sleep in. Overall, they made things more or less ""right,"" but the manner in which it was handled was really poor, and I really don't expect much. We ended up back at the Millennium the next night.

The soft bed and two kinds of fluffy pillows (one round, one flatter).  It's hard to sleep in most hotels, but that bedding cradled me like mommy's bosom.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:1.  I picked the Amalfi because of its breakfast on every floor.  Man, was I disappointed.  Cold continental breakfasts don't suit me.  I couldn't even heat up my croissant.2.  That darn TV had a severe delay, plus I had to contort my body into odd positions just to get the precise angle for the remote and tv to communicate.  In the middle of a program, the tv would reset and take me back to the menu screen.  Aaargh!3.  I had a corner room and loved how the entire wall was windows on one side.  Beaming with excitement, I peak out and find myself with an unobstructed view of a brick wall.  smhAmalfi is okay.  Definitely not my top pick in that area, but I'd stay if I had too.";3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

We had read mixed reviews and decided to take a chance on this hotel, because the more recent reviews were actually pretty decent. We should have found someplace a little bit pricier to stay. It. Was. Terrible. I have to admit the location is spectacular and the staff seemed friendly when we first got there. They explained that because of the above average temperatures the air conditioner wasn't working, and it was going to be a little warm in our room. So we think, okay, maybe it'll be like 70-ish in the room as opposed to you know, comfortable temperatures. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. They threw us on the very top floor, and it was 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER THE ENTIRE TIME. It was ridiculous. They explained to us that if it was too hot in the room, we could go downstairs and get a room change. So we went downstairs to ask. You know what happened? NOTHING. We were stuck in that about 90 degrees room. It was like if we were in a humid desert in there. They wouldn't even give us a FAN or something to at least cool the room off a little bit. Not even the least bit accommodating. It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have asthma, so the sweltering and humid heat didn't do me any good at all. What would have happened if I had an asthma attack and asked for a refund? Probably nothing, because they didn't seem all that accommodating after they explained to us that the air wasn't working properly. It was like they were saying ""Yeah, we warned you, too bad, you are stuck here!"". I mean it was so hot that if I got a total of like an hour and a half of sleep probably. Same goes for my friend.

It was clean and my room was very large. I had a separate living and sleeping area with a king bed. As I was on the 8th floor facing the side where the trains ran, I could still hear the train from that high up. It wasn't loud enough to keep me from sleeping, but it was bothersome. Otherwise, the location of the hotel was great, right on Jewelers Row and surrounded by a decent shopping area. I especially liked the Nordstrom Rack and Macy's nearby.But even so, I will probably not be staying here ever again. When I first arrived, I had requested from the front desk some extra toiletries to be sent up to my room, as the ones they provide are sparse. The front desk said someone would be up with them soon. No one ever came and I still did not receive new or more toiletries my whole stay here (I checked in on a Saturday evening and checked out on a Thursday). I also tried to request a late check-out as my convention ended at 2 PM on Thursday, but the latest they could accommodate me was only 12:30 PM, barely any difference from their current check-out time of 12 PM. So I checked out and left my luggage with the bell hop there until I could come back and retrieve it. When I did come and try to retrieve it, I waited half an hour for a bell hop to arrive at their stand near the entrance of the hotel and no one ever came. I went to the front desk with my luggage ticket and asked to receive my luggage, they radio-ed the bell hop and they didn't even receive a response. I proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for someone to finally come to retrieve my luggage. I believe one of the hotel cleaning staff working in the lobby had to come and help me get my bags.The internet is also neither wireless or hi-speed. I ended up getting so frustrated by the lack of wireless internet and slow speed of the wired internet, that I ended up using my iPad data plan for most of my stay here.I would expect more from a hotel for the rate I received (Ranged from $169 to $279 per night during my Sat. through Thurs. stay).

The next morning at 7:30am his friend was also harrassed by a different man to buy crack. My husband discussed this with the valet staff and was told it is not the first time someone reported this. My husband spoke with Andrew the Mgr. who stated there was nothing he could do since this happened on the street ....street? this happen in front of the valet area. I am sure if a hotel employee stated my husband harrassed them by the valet area security tapes would be pulled or he would be told to leave. As a HGI member I was very surprised Andrew did not offer to look at tapes, refund some or all of his points. As I stated the staff were amazing (especially the valet that let him put his car in their loading zone for the evening beacuase of the size and we did pay the valet fee would never expect not to) and the room very nice, we would have loved to return for another visit but we feel security is lacking and Andrew really wasn't very interested in getting to the bottom of this. I will not stay anywhere I cannot feel safe regardless of how nice and welcoming the staff and the good condition of the room.

When you step off said elevators you're greeted with worn and dated carpet that desperately needs to be replaced. Like another reviewer said, the hotel is set up in ""prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium"". This makes it quite loud as you get the noise from the atrium bar.  The suites are small, depressingly dim and dated. The sitting area with no natural light reminded me of a cheap motel. With such a small space, it's beyond me as to why there are 3 sinks. One in the bathroom, one in a wet bar type area, and another free standing sink in the bedroom. There are better ways they could have used that space. There is no fan in the bathroom, so it steams up big time when you shower. (mold, anyone?) The cheap little hairdrier provided barely blows any air. Even the teeny wall mounted ones you find at most hotels work better. The sheets were nice but the pillows were not feather like their website says. Now free breakfast is good because it is free. However, the line for the made to order eggs was extremely long and slow, so we opted for the pre-made. The scrambled eggs were terrible. Powdered, Im sure, but again, free. What got me, was when the egg tray was almost empty, the manager brought out another and then promptly scraped the old eggs into the pan of new eggs prompting noises of disgust from me and other patrons in line. His reply was ""What? it's not like people touched it with their hands."" Classy. Luckily I paid for this stay with Hilton points.

We stayed because my husband was attending a convention at McCormick center, but this hotel goes beyond convenience. The service was  A+ and then some. The nice lady at the front desk went above and beyond suggesting some great activities and even a golf course in the suburbs for my husband and his business partner. The city's subway is about a 20 minute walk, but it was a great opportunity to marvel at some of the neighborhood's historic buildings. Chinatown is very close too and we had a great experience at Tony Hu's Lao Sze Chuan. Also a recommendation by the lady at the hotel. (I'm so sorry I can't remember her name! Sorry!)

This is a warning for you, even if you think the price is good! This hotel is terrible and the photos at their website are grossly misleading. Even understanding that is an old building, that doesn't excuse the other issues going on inside the rooms. First of all, we asked for a new room after being put in a tiny corner room (that looked like a prison cell) on the 8th floor because it smelled so badly like urine and mildew. Our second room (the exact same room, only on the 11th floor) wasn't much better. It was mildewy, but less of a urine odor. To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room the first day. Here are the other issues with the rooms: the elevators are very slow, the TVs are old and have horrible reception, the air conditioning is via a window unit which barely works and only blows air through the mildew smelling curtains (which you have to keep closed because there are people working in the buildings adjacent), it takes forever for the water to get warm let alone hot, there were dead bugs smashed on the bathroom wall, hair everywhere, mold on the shower curtain and just an overall feeling of uncleanliness. We left early due to the fact I have mold allergies and I began to develop an upper respiratory infection. The manager still charged us for 1/2 the day, but we were just happy to leave. We drove 4 hours back to Detroit to get away. Yes, we left the Chicago Travelodge for Detroit if this gives you any idea of how terrible this place was. (I've never missed Detroit so badly!)

The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The place is bright and cheery. There is something a bit unreal about the ""island chic"" decor in the middle of a Chicago winter, but I rather like the contrast. The location is very convenient to both Downtown and to the more residential northern and western neighborhoods. The 2-block proximity to the red line is definitely a plus. They also stock the bathroom with nice Aveda products. The only draw backs I can mention are that (1)  the hotel is in need of some sprucing up! It's definitely a bit battered and some new furniture, rugs, and paint would make a difference. When I first stayed here, several years ago, it sparkled. The shine has dulled. But it's still very comfortable, clean, etc. (2) The walls and doors are a bit thin. You can hear everything in the hallway (vacuuming, cleaning staff's walkie talkies, other guests roaming the halls), so if you are super noise sensitive, you might find this to be a problem. (3) The food available downstairs and by room service is not fantastic. But there are several really excellent dining options within walking distance. And since you are in Chicago, you should really be exploring the phenomenal restaurant landscape this city has to offer, not holing up in your room. The bar downstairs is a decent place to meet a friend for a drink, but again better options are nearby, including the cute and cozy Third Coast Cafe, about 3 doors down the street.

No, not because it one of the nicer places I've stayed but because of the whole experience itself. Yes, the elevator is a tad sketchy being the fact that it takes an unusual amount of time for it to even start moving once youre in it. But i did have locks on the door and while being peg-legged the receptionist was very friendly, let us look at the room before we checked in and let us know what we were in for. I did put my own sheets on the bed and wore shoes almost all the time. I liked the charm of the place plugs cut off of all the electrical devices in the room and all. My only complaint I have about the place is the creepy guy who lives on the 14th floor right around the corner from the room we had and right across the hall from the elevator...he likes to sit with his door ajar on a chair in the corner of his room only wearing his tidy whiteys and just stares out the door. While being creepy he didnt bother with us at all. Some might say it was not the safest decision for 2 eighteen/ninteeen year old girls but was the only place in/around the city where you didnt have to be 21 to check in and was at a decent price and its nice they dont jack up the rates for Lollapalooza like every single other hotel/motel in the area.

Room was very comfortable, loved the bathrooms, spacious, bed was perfect, and the furnishings were stylish.  Only a few minor complaints - could hear people/thumpings/etc. through the walls at night, didn't really bother me but it did the Mrs. Location here is great - red line subway a few blocks away, and all sorts of pricey shopping if you're into that sort of thing.  Bar scene at night was bustling, though I wouldn't recommend many of the bars, unless you want to rub elbows with graphic t-shirt douchebags.  Gibson's steakhouse across the street was really solid, and there are some good quick places to grab breakfast if you don't feel like springing for room service.   Just like all the reviews have noted, the staff here was incredibly helpful and polite.  They helped us book a river cruise and answered numerous other dumb tourist questions.  When I made my reservation a few months prior, I explained it was for our anniversary - and upon our arrival we received a personalized note from the manager and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  Obviously, the Chicago hotel market is very competitive, and this place understands that guests appreciate a staff willing to go the extra mile.   Again, I've been at nicer hotels, but if you are into value, I don't think you can beat Sutton Place.";5;2;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

Maybe all their rooms are kinda sub-par like that - I don't know.  I'm wondering if maybe we got a crappy room because we went through Priceline.  Maybe they just have a shitastic room they keep reserved for guests who go through Priceline.  Who knows. Anyway, aside from the location (which ended up being pretty convenient for getting around), this place didn't display a lot of impressive qualities and lacks in some very basic areas. 2.5";3;4;0;1;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

Back to the hotel - dont let the name fool you.  This is like no Best Western you've ever stayed in.  It's elegant and classy, yet comfortable.  I highly recommend.";5;5;3;3;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

There isn't anything flashy or fancy about it, but its in good condition and the people are very friendly. Since my family lives a plane ride away, and my apartment is very small, they end up staying in this hotel whenever they come to visit because its amazingly close to where I live. The hotel books up really far in advance in baseball season because it is the closes hotel to Wrigley (about a mile), and good luck getting a room whenever there are Pride events or Lakeview/Lincoln Park festivals. But, they are very accomodating of special situations (like my graduation from grad school). For people visiting Chicago, I would really recommend this hotel. Its far enough away from the touristy areas that you get a good feel for a Chicago neighborhood and its a block from the express buses that run down LSD, as well as a mile from the red line. Definitely the nicest Best Western (Bestest Western?) I've seen.";4;5;3;2;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

We only stayed one night, but the front desk staff were helpful and friendly.

2774;10/7/2010;oR6sV7Z;eyx42e79U0UEIqWabS1GEA;"I miss this hotel. My wife and I will never forget our stay here from September 22-25. I just hope that we've been forgotten already (I explain later). +Great location. As Joel A. mentions, the hotel is near Lincoln Park, the red ""L"" line, and some nice restaurants (I reviewed Chili Mac's recently), bars, and shops. My wife and I went to Chicago to see the Cubs play (we love Bay Area teams more, but have been fans of the Cubs for years), and Wrigley Field is only a 15-minute walk from the hotel (after you exit and head left, you simply turn left on W. Addison St.- Wrigley is about 12 blocks away total). +The front desk employees are helpful and friendly. The guys especially made me feel comfortable (they're a bit more casual and approachable). +Some supplies are available per request. I stupidly brought shaving cream, but no razor. I knew that the hotel was going to provide me with a cheap one (oh yeah), but at least I was bailed out (we met up with an old friend of mine on the 24th, and I think his cute little girls would have been scared if I looked like Bigfoot). +There's a nice computer by the front desk. Guests are only asked to use it for no more than 15 minutes (in general, the computer should be available). +Continental breakfast is served from 7-10 am (I can't comment on it further, as my wife and I always slept in). +The area outside is very nice, and the hotel as a whole is pretty elegant. +The soda and snack machines. Most of the snacks I bought were only $.90 each, and my cans of soda were only $1 (you'll be charged more at most hotels in CA). +Their English is limited, but the housekeepers work hard and are friendly. +The ones at Embassy Suites are bigger, but my wife and I liked our suite. It featured 2 flat screen TV's, a nice desk (we both loved the office chair), a comfortable couch (I'm surprised that I didn't find myself sleeping on it), and 2 beds (we slept on separate beds, but cuddled and watched TV from mine). +Check-In is at 2 pm, and Check-Out is at 12 (I view this as a positive because some hotels want you to check-in at 3 or 4 and check-out at 10 or 11 am). +The air conditioning unit in our suite was loud, but easy to operate (my wife saw the panel on the wall before I did- prior to this, I was unplugging the unit, pressing all these buttons, and getting ready to kick it).     +/-The lobby is a little small, but nice. The chairs are large and comfortable, and there's a painting that looks like it should be part of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion (the tree and body of water look dark and spooky). My wife kept telling me which one was ""right,"" but there are 2 doors to enter and exit. -Our suite was a bit pricey. We were basically charged $206 a night. -There are no hotel shuttles. Taking a taxi to and from Midway International Airport cost us $80 total. -The bathroom in the lobby is locked (this impacted my wife and I to some degree). I understand, as it's only meant for guests (as Michael S. mentions, the hotel ""is the BEST and ONLY place to use the bathroom in this part of Lakeview before 7 am""). Still, I hate asking for bathroom keys.   -The hotel is tucked away. It's easy to pass it up if you're driving there and not familiar with the area. It's also right next to a brownstone (I quickly got used to it, but the view from our windows was less than stellar). -There are only 4 floors and 83 rooms (the hotel is long, but not wide), and pets aren't allowed. I advise booking your room months in advance, at least during baseball season. -It's nice and somewhat spacious, but my wife and I only noticed 1 elevator. -There's a fitness center that includes a Whirlpool spa tub. There's no swimming pool, though, and room service is limited (I didn't even know that there was any until now). -The toilet in our suite was weak (we had to report this twice). I had an accident on the night of the 22nd, and it took awhile to clean up the toilet bowl, floor, back wall, and tub (the towel on the tub was beyond saving- no, just a tiny speck landed on it). Anyway, the toilet wouldn't flush right from the night of the 23rd on (this really didn't have to do with me). On the 24th, a guy named Manuel worked on it (I felt sorry for him and the housekeeper when they came in- they quietly talked to each other a little in Spanish), but the plunger he had was inadequate (he needed a Snake). On the 25th, I left a nice mound behind, and my wife made her imprint felt too (we weren't descriptive at all, but the looks we got from the front desk employees we talked to were priceless). All in all, it was a real crappy situation.     Needless to say, my wife and I had an eventful stay (if we ever book a room here again, we'll arrive with plungers in hand). The hotel has a lot of charm and some friendly and understanding employees.";3;8;10;6;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

I only have one criticism -- there is breakfast but no designated breakfast room.  If you don't want to eat in the lobby you have to take your food back to your room.  However, this is a minor inconvenience -- plus, there are several good places for breakfast a block or two away.

Staff is nice and the location is great. The down side is the cleaning people do not clean. When we checked in and opened a dresser we were suprised to find condoms,lube and a dirty towel.

Pretty decently priced which is astounding.  Love the kurig in the room. Nice TV's in the room too. Walgreens right next door to buy your CTA cards and if you get here before 6 on a friday I would suggest hitting up the cute little cupcake store right next to the Madison st. entrance. It's super cute. Free wifi with great connection. I can really only take one star for the location. It is right next to an L stop but on the weekends there is nothing open on this side of town and the L lines that go to that station are only open until 12 so if you are a night owl like me you will end up spending some dough on cabs. Not their fault but definitely a downside. I would stay on the Mag Mile next time even though i despise shopping and that area in general. I also wish they had a mini fridge in the room. We left enough food at every place we went out to eat to half of the hungry in the city.

2780;5/31/2012;nBtiIsrZ3aktNy0l3szUcA;8LmOQogm-QRtSA-UL4z2zg;"It surprises me how many positive reviews have been posted for this hotel. I've stayed at this inn on five occasions and have had a negative experience each time. I won't be back. This particular La Quinta fails miserably on so many different levels. Here are a few of them: BUGGY WEB SITE SCREWS UP CHECK-IN DATE:  This topic requires an essay of its own but the short story is this:  In certain circumstances, the web reservation system will incorrectly modify your ""check in"" date -- moving it forward by one day versus what you actually entered. I was bit by this bug twice. NO WAY TO MAKE A TRUE ""RESERVATION"" AT THIS HOTEL: My reservations are frequently missing from La Quinta's computers at check-in time, despite having received a verified reservation confirmation number from the hotel via automated email. What this means is that your ""reservation"" isn't really a reservation at all. There's a 30-40% chance that when you arrive at the hotel, your reservation number will be ""unrecognized."" You'll still be ok if there happen to be some rooms available when you show up at the front desk but if not, well, you're just out of luck. NO WI-FI: The hotel claims to offer WiFi but good luck getting it to work. Upon connection, a standard ""terms of use"" page appeared but clicking ""I Agree"" just led to an error message. This occurred on my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone. The good news is that the aforementioned bug was fixed on my last visit. I was finally able to connect to the Internet -- but at an extremely low data rate. Bottom line: Be prepared to use your 3G phone. WiFi borders on useless in some rooms and is non-existent in others. ALLEY-FACING 'BAIT-AND-SWITCH' ROOMS: Recall that there's a 30-40% chance that your reservation will be ""lost"" when you try to check in. See above. The receptionist at the front desk will then see if she can find anything that's available. The ""only thing available"" will inevitably be facing the alley. The great thing about these alley-facing rooms is that at 4:45am each morning, a garbage truck will provide you with a friendly wake-up call consisting of incessant ear-piercing scraping and banging. And it is very very loud. It doesn't matter if you're on the second floor or the ninth floor. It WILL wake you up and you WILL be startled. Every time. Learn to love it. CLEANING STAFF: Cleaning service begins at 8:30am. The loud slamming of doors and yelling and laughing amongst the cleaning staff marks the beginning of cleaning time. You can't miss it. If you're still in your room at 8:30am, you can put a ""do not disturb"" sign on your door. In any other hotel, encountering a ""do not disturb"" sign indicates that the cleaning crew should come back later. Not at La Quinta though. At this place, if they encounter a DND sign in the early morning (e.g. 9am) they'll slip a little note under your door indicating that they're not going to clean the room at all and if you have a problem with it, you can visit the front desk. Not so great for guests that aren't early risers but that's ok because it's more convenient for the cleaning staff this way and in the end, that's really what counts, right? HYPOCRITICAL GREEN POLICIES: The first thing you'll see when you walk in the room is a nice little laminated note wherein La Quinta pats themselves on the back for trying to save the planet, tries to opt-out of providing basic services like clean linens, and gives you specific instructions you can follow if you actually want your room to be appropriately serviced. Being green sure is hip. La Quinta takes this hipness to a new level by providing only a thimble full of shampoo and not a single glass. What they do provide instead of clean glasses, however, is a set of six styrofoam cups -- each one individually wrapped in its own layer of disposable plastic! Wow. That's very green. WHAT THE @#$ IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE?? : I've often wondered how one hotel could be so messed up in such a diversity of ways. I wondered why the clothes drawers are only a few inches deep -- so shallow in fact that even if you're that midget from ""Game of Thrones,"" there's not enough room for you to stow a tiny folded sweater. I wondered why, during my last stay, I had a bathroom that was constructed in such a way that there's a vast chasm between the toilet and the toilet paper roll. I could go on and on but I think the real source of the problem is that the hotel owners and management haven't taken the time to actually stay here and ""test"" the place. Not all La Quinta Inns are this bad. But this one in Chicago is a uniquely bizarre trainwreck. It could be fixed if someone cared enough to do so. BETTER ALTERNATIVES: Changing my routine is never easy. But this hotel is so disappointing that I've been forced to give up in disgust. I walked around the neighborhood last night looking for potentially better Chicago hotels that I can patronize. Will try Marriott or W instead.";1;3;1;4;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2781;3/11/2012;UFCX;QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q;"I stayed at La Quinta last night after a long day in the city. Upon arrival they couldn't find our reservation and didn't quite treat it well. In the end, they did find the reservation and were apologetic. Alls well that ends well. Our room was on the 9th floor and a smoking room (gross) but the hotel was sold out and the smell only lingered a little bit. The room was beautiful~this isn't your usual La Quinta. It was quite large and spacious with two double beds. The bathroom was also very nice with a see-thru shower...OooLaLa. I liked the shade covering the window (see picture)...it made the room seem a bit chic. Tons of cable channels, nice working coffee maker (since some people noted it not working). Free breakfast from 7-10am. The parking lot next door is crazy expensive so I suggest parking in the Green City Parking lot but you'll have to be out by 7am which will mean no soup for you!";4;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA

2783;6/1/2012;IOe6TDcKL-jQZ;S7H5ZJ1DT0CIVtMQYkkfuQ;"I recently stayed at the La Quinta on a recent business trip. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as my only experience with the La Quinta brand are the road-side hotels-more-like-motels establishments. Upon arrival I was greeted by a bell hop who guided me towards the front desk. I did not have a wait upon check-in and within a span of 5 minutes or less was checked in and in my room. The rooms are adequately appointed, not opulent or awe inspiring, but most decidedly functionality. I found there to be ample closet space, working space and bathroom space. However, the set up did trigger one of my biggest pet peeves about hotels and that is there were an insufficient number of outlets. To plug in my phone charger I had to maneuver my way beside the in-room refrigerator and then pray the cord reached to the nightstand. Of course it did not and so I ended up using my laptop as an extension cord. Anyone who travels for business and prefers to use their phone as their alarm clock will find this annoying. Unlike some of the other reviews I did not encounter any early morning noise but I did hear a family complaining in the hall when they, upon entering their newly assigned room, found that it was already occupied. I also was able to access the internet without issue. The complimentary breakfast was actually quite nice. I would definitely stay here again when traveling for business.";3;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA

The Hotel had no parking, but there is a garage next door for $34 a night. We just parked our car in Bucktown on the street for free and road the train in. We liked almost everything about our room. The beds are very comfortable. One issue we had was the amount of shampoo we were given. Only one little bottle compared to normally getting shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The maid didn't even give us a new bottle for our second night. The other problem with our room was the view, or lack there of. All we could see was an alley filled with dumpsters and trash cans. It was loud early in the morning when the trash trucks came as well. One big advantage to this hotel is the free hot breakfast. It was very crowded, but the dining room and staff seemed to handle the crowd efficiently. The front desk staff was helpful as far as directions and very friendly.

2788;11/26/2009;yDQJ6j;k4e_w7fwb3xkFliAM815PQ;"Am staying at the Inn for a couple nights over the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend, 2009. In fact, am writing this review from a table in the 2nd floor's continental breakfast area.  The view of the surrounding downtown buildings on this gray, soggy morning is wonderful.  The food at the continental breakfast, not so much. The eggs are disgusting, they actually smell and taste like pancake syrup, which, since pancakes are not being offered, is hella scary. The bacon is crispy, a good thing.  Plenty of bagels and you toast your own. You can also make your own waffle (too much trouble for me to go to at a hotel when I don't make waffles in my own house). Now for my room. It's quite large, nicely appointed with modern minamlist decor, large bathroom with huge shower. Pluses:  36"" flat screen HD TV; full cable line-up; refrigerator I've now stocked with my own bottled water and diet sodas; nice decor; lots of fluffy feather pillows; free WIFI; plenty of drawers for clothes and deskspace for working; plenty of hangers in the closet. Minuses: Very stingy on the complimentary toiletries - two butter-pat sized bars of soap and one thimbleful of shampoo.  What ever happened to shampoo and conditioner and a little container of lotion?  Not to mention the shoe-buffing cloth (not that my shoes need buffing, but they make great lens cleaners for sunglasses). The water never got quite hot enough for my liking in the shower.  The AC/Heat system doesn't respond very well. I like it bone-chilling cold when I sleep at night, but the thermostat wouldn't let me lower the setting any lower than 65 degrees, and it never ever got below 67.  In the morning, I crank up the heat when I'm dressing, so I set the thermostat to 72 degrees.  An hour and a half later, the air temp had risen from 67 to 69.   Biggest complaint:  the hotel advertises they have safes at the front desk for locking up valuables.  That's not quite true. What they do have are safe-deposit boxes, the long skinny ones that you find at banks.   I found this out on my way out to dinner last night, when I took my netbook down to lock it up, since I didn't want to leave it in my room.  When I asked the staff member at the desk what other recommendations she could give me on how I could secure my netbook without having to carry it around me at all times, she said to just leave it in the room.  I don't think so. Biggest compliment so far:  Very cool decor.  Think Design Within Reach meets MOMA meets the Ikea look.";2;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2789;9/27/2010;4;w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ;"Now that's better. This is my second time staying at La Quinta. Room: Spacious, with an LCD TV and a workstation. The beds were average, but they did their job. The bathroom was nice but the shower was awkward. The glass was transparent. FAIL. The glass is supposed to be translucent, of course I was in the bathroom by myself but the glass (and mirror) took forever to steam up. It would have been one thing if the mirror wasn't in front of the shower but it was. I felt so weird showering. Pool and other amenities: There was an indoor pool, but Chicago is a pretty chilly place at the end of September. You really don't need to go swimming. (And who goes to Chicago for the pool in their hotel anyway?) The ""continental"" breakfast had eggs, bacon and sausage. Now THAT'S what I call a breakfast. Not waffles, fruit and assorted breads. Location: LOVED it. It was in the heart of Downtown/The Loop. I was in walking distance to State Street! There's also a Walgreens, Dunkin' Donuts, Jimmy John's, Starbucks, Chipotle and several other regional chain restaurants all right outside the front door. Miscellaneous: It's right next to an eL train station. It's pretty reasonably priced for a hotel smack dab in the heart of Chicago too. Had a great time staying here.

The major star deduction comes from how the staff handled an incident after the wedding. One of our wedding guests helped bring back a few of our personal items from the wedding reception to the hotel.   These items included a large Nordstrom bag and two box fans (it was really hot) which were left in the lobby bar with all the other guests as everybody wound down the evening.  My wife and I weren't told that these items were left in the bar, and we didn't know to grab them, so they were left after the bar was closed, by ourselves and several other wedding guests.  We have pictures from that night of these items in the lobby bar and inquired in the morning if they had them in lost and found (we were the last people to leave the bar).  Management and security said that they did not have them so we asked if they would review their security camera as a large bag and two box fans don't just walk away.  We received the run around from them many times and were never able to secure any footage.  Multiple people also called while we were on our honeymoon including mother, mother-in-law, and maid-of honor, but they were unable to make any progress as to where the bag of valuables and box fans could have disappeared to.  We have subsequently filed a police report which in attempt to file a claim with our homeowners policy.

The woman at the front desk was very friendly when she checked us in. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which was a HUGE disappointment. Our waitress was extremely frazzled and kind of made us uncomfortable because she was going 100mph and blaming others who worked at the lounge for how long it was taking our food. Originally we sat off to the side because no tables were open (we were joined by a friend for dinner) and the waitress approached us and we told her we'd like to wait for a table to open up. We saw one open and she said it wasn't in her section (we thought ""so what?"") and then told us she'd clean off a table in her section and then proceeded to seat us there. We ordered off the sushi and dinner menus. The sushi was a huge disappointment. I was expecting really original, creative rolls but there was nothing too extraordinary. It was good, but I'm not too picky. I've definitely had MUCH better sushi. My fiance ordered a spider roll (he gets one every time we get sushi) and barely touched it because he said it tasted awful and was the worst spider roll he's ever had. Off the dinner menu, I ordered the ratatouille ravioli and my fiance ordered the pork chop. My ravioli fell short of my expectations. My fiance's porkchop was bland, the ""fries"" that came with it were dry and the brussel sprouts... oh my goodness. Like I said, I'm not a picky eater, but I took a bite of half a brussel sprout and wanted to spit it out. It was awful. My fiance was in a bad mood after dinner and said he wouldn't mind spending so much money on food if it was actually good. After we checked out the next day, I realized I left a pair of heels in the room. We called and the hotel said they didn't find any shoes but would let us know.

Our suite had an iMac, a giant king sized bed and a nice view of Marina City. We decided to really indulge and order room service (we had dinner reservations at a nearby steakhouse). After calling and placing our order, the food arrived in the exact amount of time they told us it would arrive...to the minute. Impressive. And then, 15 minutes into eating room service called us to check up on us and inquire if everything arrived as we had ordered it. The checkout here is quick too, they have an Express Checkout option where they slip your bill under your door and you can enclose your keycards into the same envelope and drop it in a box at the lobby. No fuss checkout is always a plus isn't it? You obviously have to pay for any charges not on the bill -- but since you sign all your purchases (food or services) you are aware of it in advance. In.

We overlooked the Chicago River with the sun beaming into our room.The room had a king Heavenly bed (which can be had for $1695 w/ boxspring..tempting!), chaise by the bow window, these light green leaf soaps, and girly smelling shampoo/conditioner. Artwork with its own artist light dresses the room's walls. A sport bottle of water comes complimentary, as does Starbucks grounds.  An LG 32"" LCD is placed smack middle in front of the bed. The highlight for me? A Speakman DUAL SHOWER HEAD. The cool feature is that not only do you get a greater surface area, but you can turn off one head by pushing a back valve on the left showerhead.

The $70 Indiana hotels we stayed in had much more comfortable beds but ($219) The River was extremely clean and the staff were very polite and professional. Transformers 3 was being shot right outside the hotel and it was such a surreal experience, as we were walking to the valet station, we had to walk trough the set - there were overturned vehicles, ash covered streets, collapsed buildings - it was like walking through an apocalypse! There were some angry Brits yelling at the front desk about the noise and streets being shut down, but it wasn't their fault, the hotel did everything they could to make a pleasant experience out of a minor (okay... major) inconvenience.";4;0;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

The prices for the rooms were about the same, but the Chicago River Hotel has an awesome location- right by the river and Michigan Ave. We were only a few blocks from Millennium Park, steps away from the shopping, and close to the metro. As I booked the room on their website and made the reservation, it said that the room won't actually be charged to my card until we physically arrive and check-in. However, a couple days before our arrival I noticed the charge to my credit card. When I called in to inquire, the first guy who I spoke with was rather rude, and argued with me, saying that I must not have booked on their site because they don't take the money out until check-in. He put me on hold, and I was connected to a manager, who was extremely nice and apologetic. Seems there was some problem with their site. He assured me that my request for a room with a nice view would be waiting for us upon our arrival. Sooo fast forward a couple days, and we get to the hotel. We check in, I speak with the manager I spoke with on the phone, everything seems fine. We get up to our room and we had problems getting the room key to scan in the door.. this actually happened EVERY single time we wanted to get in. It took on average 5-10 scans before the key would be read each time. Imagine our frustration. Anyway, the room was nice enough and modern, but it was DINKY. Super small. I'm guessing it was this size because it was a corner room, but it was definitely narrow. Our view was nice though, of the river and buildings across the way. One morning when we were heading out, housekeeping was cleaning some of the rooms on our floor. The doors were open, and what we saw were much bigger rooms, but they didn't seem like they were suites. Is it wrong that after the problems with the room charges to my card, I would expect them to do some nice gesture for us to make up for it? I dunno... I think I'd rather pay a little more and get a bigger room somewhere else.";3;2;1;1;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

Clean but very awkward.  I think the hotel did a really good job of trying to make the room as comfortable as possible, however it was pretty clear that guest rooms have been converted.  My room was not particularly large but again the hotel did a really good job of trying to accommodate guest.  There was a nice desk area that would serve the business traveler well.  A mini-fridge and microwave was also on hand.  The bed was not remarkable, but it was clean.  My only true gripe about the River Hotel is definitely the bathroom.  I am a woman; so bathrooms are important.  Not only did it appear as if this bathroom was converted from a former closet, there was no bath tub.  It's not that I wanted to take a bath, I just like to be able to distinguish my bathing space from the rest of the bathroom and this was not possible with the shower stall which was provided.  If you are just looking for a place to set down your belongings and beat the streets...this hotel will serve you well.";3;1;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

Lena in the Sales department did a great job reserving blocks of rooms for the guests and responding quickly to my questions and requests leading up to the big day.  The check-in staff were able to hand out welcome bags that we had assembled  upon checking in.  Pricing was pretty good given their location. Overall the out of towners were very happy with the place. Important things to know -  parking is pricey valet only, although there are cheaper pay lots nearby too.  Restaurants nearby are the ones in Greek town or the one in the hotel.  I had the breakfast buffet in the hotel, which was good, although it was your typical fare at typical hotel price (some of my guests had breakfast vouchers). We had a 2 room suite for the bridal party, which was spacious, comfortable, and modern.  Family liked being able to run across the street to Dominicks for snacks and food for the room while everyone was getting ready.

There are two bus stops right across the street from the hotel, the 8 and the 20, both of which are very useful. Behind the hotel is a Walgreen's, as well as Greek Town. The staff at the hotel was always helpful and friendly, of course we only used them to check in, check out, and find the pool. And yes, they have a pool, well, not technically. But they give you passes to get into a pool in a residential tower two blocks away. When we got to the pool, it was an entire health club at our disposal. One more thing about the Crowne Plaza is that they had one of the best shower heads I've come across in a hotel. It was a rain style head with three points of articulation.

There's a number of amenities of which borrowing an umbrella is one, is available. Room service till 11pm. I also like how you need a room card to use the elevators.. it adds a safety factor. During our last stay, we had problems with other guests harassing us with no help from the staff. The shower didn't drain and maintenance said they fixed it but for the entire weekend we showered in standing water.. This stay was much better.. the only thing that we can say anything about is housekeeping. After having our room cleaned, they never replaced the glasses or sundries and the towels were folded and messily placed on the shelf. Other than that, everything was fine.

I was able to get to where I wanted to be quickly and cheaply by avoiding street lights. The CP Metro has two bus stops that can connect you with the major transfer hubs for both buses and trains. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a full service supermarket named Dominick's across the street from the main entrance. Behind the hotel you can find a Walgreen's, Starbucks and various eateries which are open until the wee hours of the morning. Hotel : From the outside the CP metro looks very outdated but don't judge just yet. The inside has been fully remodeled in a very sleek and modern motif. It modern with a splash of Miami. The hotel offers king and double rooms most with small balcony. I had a great room facing the Sears Tower. A business center, and fitness center are also offered. The CP Metro has a full service restaurant and bar located on the ground floor named Retro . A 1940's American Eatery and Martini Bar offering American classics with a contemporary flair. Room: All rooms are fully carpeted tiled and offer a flat panel television, mini fridge and free Wi-Fi ( it was rather slow so I used the cable connection instead). The bathrooms were average in size and offered a pocket door instead of a standard one. Beds were comfortable. Overall the room was very clean. The staff I encountered were courteous, friendly and accommodating. I arrived early and they held my bags I also requested a double room because I had previously requested a king. Everyone was really nice and I got no attitudes at all. Hotel tends to be busy on weekdays since it host various company meetings and trainings.

Our experience was positive overall.  Here were the pros and cons. PROS Relatively inexpensive when compared to city hotel prices.  Our room that had two double beds was $92 plus taxes. Our room was clean and in the morning I saw several housekeeping employees starting on the rooms so that told me they have adequate staff to keep the motel looking its best. It's on the city's north side, not far from Andersonville.  The Clark and Ridge location puts you convenient to many popular north side eateries, shops and of course, Wrigley Field. CONS It can be a bit noisy, especially if you're not used to ""city noise"". Parking.  While they do have a private lot, there is an equal number of spots per room, which means if two cars of customers are staying in one room, two spaces are used.  We saw cars blocked in (ours included) in the morning due to this. The bathroom is pretty small and the shower curtain was a bi-fold style, made of hard plastic that, when closed, made the small shower area even more cramped. The Four Seasons it isn't but then again, it's about a quarter of the price too.  It's a budget motel in an expensive city.  If you're budget conscious, you might want to check it out.";3;7;1;0;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ

The door to our room looked as though it had been on the receiving end of a steel-toed boot recently, which we found a little disconcerting. There was a small TV mounted on the wall with only a few channels, no towel bars at all in the bathroom, and absolutely no amenities. For aficionados of 60s touches like fleshtone bath fixtures, the originals are still in place here. Worst of all was NO internet connection, and people at the front desk seemed clueless as to what a router was, or how to get online. This was a major inconvenience, as I had work to get done. The part-time elderly guy at the counter shrugged and referred me to the 24 hour Kinkos nearby. The ""breakfast"" was your typical motel carb-fest and really bad coffee. We found the parade of quirky characters coming in and out entertaining, except for the woman running around yelling in the parking lot at 5 a.m. I will say that everything was very clean, and we'd probably stay here again solely because of the price, as long as we didn't need to get online for anything.";2;0;0;0;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ

This hotel is past due for a tear down and a rebuild. 1st room - no air conditioning 2nd room - no working toilet (water pressure in the automatic flush valve was insufficient to flush anything, not even a piece of toilet paper) Other defects - broken TV on/off switch in room two, broken a/c control in room 2, cracked sink bowl in room 2, no cups in room 1, TV remote does not work in either room. Common Area defects - Hallways are hot - not air conditioned, elevators are slow, call lights are not lighted, 2nd elevator from parking garage in disrepair, no security and direct access from street outside to hotel floorspace using elevator 2, not enough parking available. Cosmetic - room décor is combination 70s and 80s. It's not timeless - just old. The bathroom finish materials are plastic and cheap and look terrible. Pluses - staff is working with a failing albatross, yet maintains a positive attitude toward guests - for the most part, housekeeping is doing a herculean job to keep bedding and towels and rooms in clean condition - for the most part. Negatives - staff management protocol near full booking is to re-sell a reserved room at 4 pm. I learned at 6:30 p.m. that my credit card reserved room was given away 2 1/2 hours earlier at 4 p.m. while I was in a jet flying to Chicago - amazing poor customer relations on this item. That's how I ended up with the room without air-conditioning - it's all they could offer. And because the entire city hotel system was booked, I had no choice. Unbelievable. I've never heard of releasing a room at the very moment it becomes available for occupancy...The second night, they switched me to room #2 which had A/C but no working toilet. Oh well, they tried, I guess. Overall conclusion: Do whatever you can to stay elsewhere. This hotel is broken. However, if you are an intrepid type and you don't mind hardships like heat and no working toilet, and if you are pressed for a room because there are no other vacancies within 30 miles, it is possible to sleep here and shower here - there is minimal but sufficient comfort to accomplish that due to the decent housekeeping.

Issue #1 - I found out king size bed to be very uncomfortable. Issue #2 - Either every single guest in the Ramada was speaking through a bull horn, or the walls were paper thin.  Either way, starting somewhere between dawn and when I finally fell asleep, I was able to hear conversations, other people showering, dressers opening and closing, and everything else people do in hotel rooms.  No not THAT. Issue #3 - Though this is beyond the control of the hotel staff, I must also mention that there was a bird right outside our window who, the very second the sun shone it's face over Lake Michigan, took it upon itself to inform all other living creatures that it was morning at the top of it's tiny, little lungs. Other unpleasantries: -Understaffed front desk.  It took a good twenty minutes to check in. -Hookers in the lobby.  Not call girls.  Not ladies of the evening.  Straight up white trash, track marked hookers. The good things: -Relatively in expensive for a Chicago hotel. -""Free"" parking. -Right on the Lake.  We were fortunate enough to view a regatta race going on in the distance as we checked in.

The room I did stay in was located in a separate bldg across the way overlooking the pool, which was emptied, full of leaves and I'm assuming because it was off-season and temperatures were close to freezing at night.  The room wasn't as dated as the rooms in the main building, but the exterior walls were a bit worn and a chipped.  With that said, I decided to give it a try anyways because the room had wireless internet that worked, the fridge worked and it had both a.c. and heating available. I should point out, that the refrigerator in the room worked well for beverages only.  The walls were extremely thin, but I did not notice that until my 2nd night there, since it was practically empty when I initially arrived here, but you will hear door slams from the other rooms next door if it is fully booked.  On the plus side: Access to the #6 bus into downtown Chicago was easily accessible (about 3 blocks away).   Overall, I received a fair rate on Priceline and would only recommend staying here if you are a deep sleeper, on a budget and don't need a fast internet connection(as I mentioned, it's spotty).  FYI, There is however a small computer room with a printer in the lobby guests can use.";3;2;0;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA

Our experience started off over the phone where my friend called to see if we can get an early check-in. The front desk clerk who took answered the call was quite unprofessional and sounded like she dumb founded, so my friend hung up. The check-in seemed to be fine until we actually went to our room. The bellman helped us to our original room (1423) and was very courteous and informative. When we finally opened the door to our room, immediately we smelled a stench of either vomit or rotten milk. *uGh* GROSS. We questioned the bellman to see if he can smell the odor and he said no and proceeded to call the house keeping. I did not like the fact that the bellman sounded a bit rude when he stated over the phone ""the guests in 1423 thinks there's an odor in here, but I don't smell anything and I am highly sensitive of any stench."" I'm sorry, but if there was really no odor, would you really think I'd waste my time fussing over the room when I could be around town. After the call was made, the bellman told us if there was anything wrong he was sure they would be able to accommodate us and still refused that there was an odor in our room and said all the rooms smelled like that. The bellman left and house keeping came in with his spray bottle in his hand. Of course, right away he smelled the odor and we pretty much told him that won't help. So we called the front desk to make arrangements for a new room. Little did we know that we were going to get moved to the 10th floor which had the stench of cigarettes throughout the floor. *uGh* gross. We pay the suppose ""4-star"" price at a non-smoking hotel for a reason and I felt like we stayed at a 2 or 3 star MOTEL because of the service and uncleanliness of the hotel. I honestly wished we would of just booked two nights at the Wyndham.";2;0;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

I am impressed with the personal follow-up and attention. This is more than I would have ever expected, and have not experienced this type of courteous response from any other hotel I have stayed at.

Not a big deal thought if you're not going to spend too much time in it. The hotel was right across from Lincoln Park (really pretty park with a free zoo in it). And close to buses and trains that would take you downtown or to several attractions.The only negative point I could think of when it comes to this hotel is the parking.

The door man, and I cannot remember his name but you'll know him when you see him: he was suuuuper nice and remembered my name after the first time we met.  The valet guys and the guy who helped me take my luggage to my room were all nice and accommodating.2. I was afraid the location was a little too far north, but it was actually at an ideal spot.  I was able to run to the lake, walk to Millennium Park and there are stores everywhere.  It was really convenient for me and at night it was nice to just walk around the neighborhood.3. The bed was so comfortable and the tub was great for relaxing.  Part of the reason I chose the hotel was for the tub.Now for the bad:1. As someone else said, this place needs a ""facelift."" My room showed a lot of wear and tear, especially the shower.  I had to forcefully open and close the door every time because it had this weird rubber stopper on it that was falling off.2. You have to pay for wi-fi: $10/day.  I just think that's really steep, especially since other hotels that aren't as fancy give it to you for free.3. The bed doesn't have a fitted sheet.  I think that is so weird and you can just see the mattress from certain angles.  And flat sheets never stay put, so with one pull you're all of a sudden on the mattress.4. I paid $45 a night for parking and I found out later that they just park the car outside somewhere nearby.  I thought it would be indoors at the hotel.  If I had known that I would have just parked in a parking garage because the whole point was so that my car would be in a building and close by. I had to wait 30 minutes for my car (even though I called down for it 15 minutes before and they assured me it would be there in 10 minutes).  Also, my clock and radio surface is warped so I can barely read the time.None of these things are horrible, but for a place that touts itself as a luxury hotel and charges that much money for a night, I just don't think it's worth it at all.";3;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
