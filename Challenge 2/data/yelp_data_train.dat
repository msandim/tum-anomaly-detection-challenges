8/9/2010;veKKNAaSKWj8os;nR7zLyFOlzAYqmzgJ3DtXg;"Disgusting!!!  There is literally duct tape holding together the elevator.  Crack heads live here.. not safe!  Walked in, bought a room.. saw it and left.  No locks on doors, no parking, no air conditioning, no way! For the $$ you pay for the room ($ 55 a night) and parking ($ 38 a night) you could stay down the street at The Ohio House and NOT sleep with one eye open.  Would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.  Seriously, DO NOT STAY HERE!";1;1;0;3;N;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg
8/11/2012;6c-ZiQkHXtp1n6VfiKDQ3g;747lP4p8dUD6RTkcsIaSGg;"This hotel came up on Hotwire for $108 a night.  We wanted to stay in this area so we took it.  The Tremont is an older hotel updated to boutique style.  I'm rather amazed by some of the other snarky reviews -- if you want rooms like the Drake or the Four Seasons, book yourselves there and pay the price!   In fact, our room (910) was fine.  It's a bit small, but large enough to hold a rather monumental king size bed with a giant headboard.  Perfectly comfortable.  There's decent free WiFi and plenty of outlets.  The bathroom has a slightly odd layout but is a bit larger than at the Inn of Chicago, where we stayed the first two nights we were in town. You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower.  So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities.  You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.   It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time.  But this is a small quibble.  Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet.  But we did notice a café in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent.  There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel.  Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.   In short, no real complaints.  The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!";4;2;0;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

The rooms are nice, if you like lumpy beds, peeling wallpaper, caked on dust on the air vents, disgusting bathrooms, and zero customer service. If they were a hostel, I'd be more understanding. But this place purports to be a classy old hotel.   If you're a hobo looking for a flophouse, this might be for you. There are plenty of dumpsters nearby for any biscuit-spearing you might have on your itinerary.  By all means, catch a cannonball to chi-town but mind the bone polishers. If you are a non-hobo, look elsewhere.";1;0;1;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
9/14/2012;ELY3TK;OMm2VcGks3QL0p0n3_kPFw;"Stayed here when I went to Chicago for a wedding.  The hotel had an old world charm that my husband and I liked and made us choose this over something more modern.  Yes, the hotel only had 1 small elevator which made it a little inconvenient when there were multiple groups (with luggage) at the same time, which reminded me of a hotel in Europe.  The rooms were modest, the bathroom was fine, everything was clean... not luxurious, but what do you expect.  The location itself is conveniently located just off the main street.  I think we ended up paying $160 per night (after taxes were added) during the weekend in July, which was cheap for that area when we looked.  Overall, fairly comfortable and affordable, a decent option.";3;2;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

Three things come to mind. 1)  The room's wallpaper and paint were perhaps current when leisure suits were legitimately fashionable. 2)  The hotel doesn't have a gym or a restaurant. 3)  I called down to the front desk because someone literally stole the cord off the back of the television and I wanted to watch the news, but there was no answer.  What kind of @!#$%!@#$ hotel doesn't answer at the front desk?  I ended up calling six times and never got through to the front desk, so I finally just took the one (yes, one) elevator down there.  I couldn't find a single person who works for the hotel.

A sparse continental breakfast of desserts and cereal is provided in the adjacent Ditka's restaurant. My bf is an SPG platinum elite member. Daniel upgraded us to the penthouse suite three days before our reservation. However when we arrived, it was unavailable due to construction. We were transferred to a suite in which one shower did not function, and the bathroom reeked of urine. We complained to the manager, who stated she did not smell anything unusual.

Yes, it's old and small but we had a good time here. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and it was more spacious than I thought it would be. You could tell one wall had some water damage at one time, but everything was clean and everything worked. I didn't deal with the staff besides checking in and out, but the people I did speak with were friendly. There weren't a ton of amenities but I didn't come to Chicago to hang out in my hotel room. The train is only a few blocks away and you're surrounded by tons of places to go shopping. I would definitely stay here again.";4;1;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

Inviting entrance to the hotel with a canopy with heat lamps when you walk up. The elevator is small and a little rickety but it does the job. I would bring your own towels as the hotel ones are a bit scratchy. Didn't encounter the hotel staff much, just at check in/out -they were polite.  I would stay again when in town.";4;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

9/21/2010;4sIRV-M-nrhyU5wHJSznrA;y5ptsWmvGEAftOQaiFhBcg;"I can't imagine paying full price to stay here. We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, ""Oh, let me take that for you sir."" So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!";2;0;0;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

The Tremont fit the bill. Great views, There weren't an abundance of tv channels, but the picture was clear and I sure didn't travel to Chicago to stay in the room and watch tv. and would prefer not to pay higher rates so others can.

4/4/2011;FRM7-hER5S9wMf0IzciDcg;0oA4l1ob50aIZ9x9Kxobqg;"Great location for a good price. Book it directly on their website and get the AAA price for the best deal. Hotel has that old Chicago charm. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Bathroom appeared to have been updated in the past few years. 32"" flat screen in the lowest cost room. (single queen) Was able to connect my laptop to it and watch videos. Could tell that the woodwork in the rooms was old, probably the original. But it was still in good condition and fit the building. They have some kind of incense/oil going in the lobby and it might be on the strong side for some people, but it didn't bother me. Continental breakfast is available at the Mike Ditkas next door for $5 a person. It isn't anything special but what's there is decent. Overall it's a very nice hotel. I dont need much for amenities above a clean room and comfy bed and this hotel fit that perfect. Free wi-fi is an excellent bonus. For the money, it was the best deal in town if you dont need 5 star accomodations. One quick note, during my stay in March 2011 the building next door was being torn down so the construction crews were working early weekday mornings. I'd expect that a new hotel is being built and would take some time once the demo is complete.";4;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
8/23/2010;0fLzbPuBnOMKzVnmxqz-1w;3KM5g9hyaR-uE92WfMU6Cw;"Another Travelzoo deal at an awesome price of $99 per night.  The Tremont is located just a few blocks off the Magnificent Mile on Chestnut, right next to Ditka's.  The lobby is narrow and have some seating in cozy groups with little candy dishes scattered around.  My first impression upon checking in was that customer service is not their high suit. More to come on this in a moment. I get my key, some maps and a reminder about the free internet and breakfast in the morning served next door at Ditkas for $5 (free with my package but I pass so I can't speak to this).  I get up to my room and open the door.  The room itself is spacious for what it is.  There's a separate sink vanity and spacious closet and roomy bathroom with shower over tub.  The plumbing hardware was a bit off and needed a serious update because they were circa 1960s (think Edward Scissorhands ).  The bed was very firm and the fitted sheets were shallow on the corners so if you were making cupcakes, they'd totally flip off (see picture).  Another sign of this hotel's age was that the window coverings were old mini blinds.  And another pet peeve for me is the linens.  These were of inferior quality with a funky Motel 6-ish comforter/quilt and not a down comforter embraced in a high TC duvet.  Yes, I have been spoiled with my Calvin Klein linens. Back to the service...  Upon departure and asking for a copy of my statement for expense reimbursement, service was of 'eh quality.  The response I got was my stay was prepaid (i.e. ""I'm not going to waste my time printing one for you"").  I then explained I needed a copy anyway for reimbursement, then silence and no eye contact (i.e. ""I'm going to ignore your request"").  So, annoyed, I then walk out but oddly get my back yelled at in a very loud tone (i.e. ""Ma'am!"" ""Ma'am!!""), 3 times, until I make it out the front door, keep in mind, there are 2 other guests in the lobby watching this unfold..  Unprofessional methinks. Hmmm.... Overall, for the price and the fact that I only had to spend 7 hours in the room, it was good enough.";2;0;1;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

4/24/2011;8a8MaeJ99mi3WTUZYDYL2Q;SKgjcQz0TNg8LKqlJwxjfg;"Decent price for downtown Chicago over a weekend.  Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed.  Piano in the lobby needs tuning.  Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's.  Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.";2;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

As others have said, the decor is outdated, but the antique-like furnishings do give this place character, and it's very clean. You can't beat location -- stores, restaurants, lakefront, etc., are all very walkable. With the exception of wi-fi and shampoo/handcream in the room, this place offered absolutely no amenities -- even the free continental breakfast they offered last time I was here is gone, and they charged me $3 to store my luggage for a couple hours after I checked out -- every other hotel I've ever been to does that for free. All in all, I wanted a reasonably priced, clean, convenient place to crash while I was in Chicago, so this was a great option, but on trips to Chicago where my company is paying or I want a little more comfort, this would not be at the top of my list.";3;0;0;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
7/17/2010;07mEVsw7wUKuUOH;Uu-qEGsSb72ngIQUF85rDQ;"I arrived at the Tremont this past weekend for one night only. I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the ""older"" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!";2;2;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

OLD!  Yeah, well--my wallpaper is peeling too.  I found the Tremont to be very comfortable if a little overpriced (what downtown hotel isn't?)  From my twelfth floor room I had a lovely view of the Lake--or would have if that damn Hancock Building hadn't been in the way.  The Tremont is close to all the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the Looking Glass Theater, Water Tower Place, the Hershey Store, Bistro 110--all the jostle and jump of the Water Tower neighborhood.  Even though the Tremont is no more than a block from all the activity, Chestnut is a peaceful enough street that my room was quiet at all times.  The Tremont staff seems polite and helpful; the bathroom seemed recently updated.  The Continental Breakfast ($5.00) was only okay, but it was a sufficient jump start on Saturday morning. I was very happy with my stay at the Tremont and would recommend it to anyone except the most persnickety Felix Ungers out there.";4;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng

Downside: I don't think they had cleaned the comforter OR sheets in a while.  There were some interesting stains on them and the wall.  We avoided these by using our own blankets and pillows.

I was really nervous about staying here because the reviews were so mixed. When we arrived we were relieved because the lobby is a lot nicer than the photos show. The parking was $15 but that was okay because it's expensive to park anywhere in Chicago. The staff were very friendly and quick. We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep. The breakfast was nothing special. The bagels were really hard but it was free so we didn't complain. The free wi-fi is very slow and won't work with any apps on a tablet/touch pad, just an internet browser because you have to ""log in"" every time you want to access something. It's not really worth using but will get the job done if you really need it. They also offer free coffee and hot tea in the lobby 24/7. We thought that was nice, especially because we were walking in the cold. Overall for the deal we got and the location it was not bad at all.

Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan.  While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying.  Just get a new, quieter fan.  I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses.  The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress.  The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height. This makes for a very uncomfortable night sleep and a sore back the next day. With the above changes, this hotel could go from being second rate, to a real first class establishment.";2;0;0;0;N;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving.  (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?)  I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL.  Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for.  My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing.  Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it.  She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day.  Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall).  We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour.  (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain!  102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000.  Try doing that in downtown Chicago.  (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given.  The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar).  A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).";5;1;0;1;N;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

The ceremony set-up was perfect, and the turn-around for a 165-person dinner happened like clockwork. Working with Anne during the preparations was a piece of cake, too. She was always available for a meeting or a phone call, and responded to emails immediately. Taking us through the tastings, to making suggestions about layout, Anne definitely listened to what we wanted and produced just that for the wedding. The hotel ballroom-area is beautiful. I received compliments all night about how amazing the hotel is, and what a fantastic venue it is for a wedding. The decor is perfect, and the size is just right. It's as formal or informal as you want it to be. The bar and two adjoining rooms are romantic and cozy, and perfect for quiet conversations and cushy seating. The hotel rooms are fabulous, too. We stayed in a room that was absolutely perfect. It was right up the stairs from the bar, and it had everything we wanted.

The staff at The Carleton deserve some recognition.  I had quite the crowd -- the most bottles  ever consumed at one event.  Yup, that's us!  We had a few scenarios that would've thrown the average banquet staff off their game, but not this one!  I can't say enough about the conscientious effort to make my wedding the best it can possibly be.  The food was amazing -- we had chosen honey mustard crusted chicken, rib eye and salmon.  All deserving high marks. All the guests that made mention of the food were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of these dishes.  The rib eye was the most consumed entree and this piece of meat was something to be expected at a high end steak house.  Very nice.  Our room was beautiful, clean and large.  We had 12 other guests booked at the hotel and all were pleased as well.  Poor Phil's is the bar and grill which I have reviewed in the past, but will mention that they serve a great breakfast!  Several guests enjoyed the morning after here.";5;3;1;3;N;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

Very nice front desk staff during morning and late evening hours. This was more like a smaller boutique hotel in a GREAT area, Wabash and Erie, 2 blocks or less from everything including Michigan Avenue. Safe, clean, well landscaped lush area. Property also clean, well maintained and fresh smelling. Sure, rooms are small but why would you stay in your room in this great city. I didn't find them terribly small. There was a small hallway that went past the bathroom to an area with a desk, queen bed and flat screen. Modern decor and colors. Small dresser in closet with ironing board and safe. Bathroom larger than I expected after reading the other reviews. FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had yogurt, cereal, hot cinnamon rolls, an egg product, sausage, etc. Hot beverages were always available throughout the day. Clean dining area just off lobby. Clean, comfortable beds, updated fixtures, comfy bed, clean, bright linens. I did not have too many issues with noise overall. Good water pressure, hot water, clean towels. Partial view of street, room not totally blocked in. Again, you're not here to look out the window. You are here to eat and shop. (Don't kid yourself). You don't need a car here in the city so save your efforts with that. Close to trains, buses, etc. Easy walkable city. Trader Joe's is across the street, Grand Lux, Bloomingdale's Home, Dues Pizza around corner, Michigan Avenue two blocks away, quick walk. All the restaurants/shops any visitor would want. Save yourself the bloated overhead of some of the other more crowded Magnificent Mile hotels and stay here. Nothing bugs me more when the common areas, lobbies, etc. are just crammed with tourists.

Rooms are on the small side, but that is because the building was built in the 1930s hence the small rooms compared to other hotels.

The cleanest bathroom I felt comfortable putting my bare tush on the toilet, and my bare feet in the tub. The shower tub had a mat on the tub floor which means they can remove it and sanitize for the next person ! I love how cute and chic the whole hotel felt. I will definitely stay here again, I'm looking forward to it. Con Jus checked out. Valet parking took forever to bring the car around ! We called before we left the room, checked out, and waited. And waited like fifteen minutes. It took valet a total of half hour to bring the car around. Valet ls $40. Self park at the same garage for overnight is $39. Next time id rather save a dollar +tip and park my own Damn car. Valet was not economically savvy after waiting forever to get my car it was not rush hour. The time I waited I could have gotten my own car and loaded up my luggage and been on my way to my flight !! The valet guy was not even apologetic for taking Soo long.

There was a random beark skin blanket on the bed? Not sure why since it didn't match the victorian decor at all.  The bed was comfy and the pillows.  Which is always a plus except when you can't get a good nights sleep because you're woken so much thru the night. The room wasn't huge, standard size room, but had a nice full length mirror on the closet doors.  Lighting wasn't the best, I can't imagine the two other lamps would have shed much more light.  The bathroom was fairly lit and decent in size.

The hotel is located in the Gold Coast area of downtown Chicago and is only one block from the shopping along Magnificent Mile and Michigan Ave. The doorman took our bags and led us to the counter for check-in. The lady at the counter was friendly and explained the basics of the hotel, such as room service, on-site restaurants, and the business center. Up to the room we went. She then mentioned that we were upgraded to a junior suite...score! Entering the room on the 10th floor, the older decor was an instant eye-catcher, which is a good thing. A few of the artsy fixtures looked like something from medieval times and the bed frame was also old-fashioned (I added a few photos of our room). There is a small bench at the end of the bed which is good for watching TV or looking out of the window. The mattress on the bed was AWESOME, as it was very firm and conformed to my body. Six pillows lined the headboard, all of a somewhat different level of cushion. Closet space is standard, with a set of hangers, an ironing board, and a safe. Lighting was low, even with a ceiling light and five lamps spread throughout the room. I believe they need to add one more adjustable bright lamp, because the darkness is bad on the eyes when watching TV or using the computer. The bathroom was nice! Good power in the shower water, clean and fresh smelling, nice toiletries, and the hand soap was the same clam shell shape as the soap dish. Nice touch! A complimentary newspaper is left at the room door every morning and the soundproofing between rooms is solid. The housekeepers are friendly and if they see you in the halls, they ask if you need your room tended to...little things like this make hotels stand out. Lobby doors are opened for you when you come and go, and catching cab is a breeze as the cabs line up to the left of the building. The hotel is also close to State Street and is within walking distance to many areas around downtown. The hotel provides a number of maps and pamphlets to help you plan you daily activities. Sooo, my only ""gripe"" is the lack of lighting within the room. The hotel was remodeled a number of times and has very unique look compared to the more modern hotels that surround it in the same area.

It's definitely worth your money if you are to pay the same for the Whitehall or the Seneca. The only reason they are up for comparison is because they are both within steps of the Hancock center and they are both very historical buildings. However, Whitehall just renovated it to be a little more modern and a little less creaky than Seneca. The lobby still retains its old world flair but the rooms have been updated to have plush beds and nice bathrooms. This is the perfect spot for a secret weekend getaway because it makes you feel like you have been hidden away, yet are steps from Michigan ave!";4;3;2;2;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

Our room was loaded with antiques in great condition.  The bathrooms are very nice - hand-laid tiles, plenty of room.   The staff was very attentive, very responsive to inquiries and really were what you'd expect from a old school hotel like this. The location is perfect - a short block from Hancock and Water Tower Place, TONS of shops within easy walking distance (if that's your bag) and many top-notch restaurants also within 3 blocks in every direction. (not to mention a pretty good Itallian spot right in the hotel). This is definitely a hotel from an era long gone - but still at the top of it's game. *The price I listed as ""Moderate"" but keep in mind that that is in comparison to the other hotel options in the area.*  For the Gold Coast, it is a great price.";5;0;0;0;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

TFS has great service, sure, but the Whitehall is the little train that could, comparatively.  They try harder with less and do better. It's a different hotel.  Nostalgic, quirky, comfortable, neat.  The bar staff in particular rocks my world --- if Poppy is still there then management is damned lucky indeed.   Funny story about the series of shenanigans I encountered at this fine establishment but we won't go into it now, here.  What I'm saying though is maybe I'm sentimental and maybe you wouldn't feel the same if what you're looking for is The Four Seasons or The Pen.   But I've been to both those and many others and quite prefer The Whitehall in the final tally.  When I'm back in Chi, you'll be finding me there.";5;2;2;0;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

We'd checked out a BUNCH of hotels on Expedia and Yelped a bunch as well, and we settled at the Whitehall. We also got a great deal on our hotel + flight combo through Expedia, and we're glad we booked here. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location in Chicago. It's in the downtown area, and MINUTES away from any and all transportation you'd need to get where you've gotta be. It's a block away from the major buses you'd need, and only 3 blocks away from the L line. The decor of the place is nice -- it's a good mix of old-fashioned ideas with a modern touch. The people who work the desks are extremely helpful, and knew we were out of towners -- gave us some recommendations immediately for places to eat and even drew out how to get there...always a plus. The room itself: completely and absolutely perfect for what we needed it for. We weren't here to soak in bed all day, we were gonna be out exploring what Chicago had to offer. So the Whitehall delivered -- a BEAUTIFUL room (HUGE bed), with a nice bathroom and desk to plan things out. It was cleaned the same time each day, and the staff left it looking terrific. If we ordered anything to the room (such as towels, extra toothpaste, etc), they brought it up within 2-3 minutes, which is also a plus. The negatives: the real estate isn't great. Rooms are a bit on the smaller size, but again, it had everything we wanted and it had it done well. The other odd thing was the curtains...they weren't able to be closed. They were in a fixed open position, but luckily, there was a FIRST LAYER of blind to close the window off but allow SOME light in. Just an odd sort of characteristic. Overall, the Whitehall, for it's location and price, really can't be beat in my mind. Although it's got it's odd shortcomings, so does every hotel, and my girlfriend and i had an EXTREMELY pleasant stay here.";4;0;0;0;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

I was concerned about some of the reviews on yelp and tripadvisor but, I thought I would give it a chance. Yes, it's old and small. Yes, it could use a makeover. But, for the price it's awesome. I did see the strings hanging of the chair in my room that someone photographed. Maybe I got the same room. But, come on, who cares. I wasn't hosting a social event. The place is clean. Things are worn but, not warn out. The bed is comfortable and they give you lots of fluffy pillows. I felt very comfortable leaving my personal items out on the bed or bathroom counter. The staff was extremely friendly and helped me quickly. The air conditioning was noisy and I had to use ear plugs. However I don't think it was any different then any other hotel in the area. The Four Seasons is directly across the street and at $500 per night they provide ear plugs for you. My friend stayed there for the same convention. The shower at the Whitehall gave me a warm shower everyday and the safe was large enough to hold my laptop. Bottom line if you want to pampered in a luxury hotel, go to a luxury hotel. If you want a great value go to the Whitehall.";4;1;0;0;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
5/30/2010;ttSGe;c0dGxYrevPmgMxS5rn1DEQ;"3.5  I ended up at The Whitehall because they offered the best rate going for my last minute, end-of-week, one-night biz trip stay.  A happy chance meeting for me.  I'd stay here again. If you're looking for a shiny modern-contemporary boutique hotel experience, this isn't it.  Whitehall has a more comfortable, traditional vibe that wouldn't be hurt by a little updating -- perhaps an interior paint job, some more modern lighting.  But don't be put off by the lobby area (rather dark and fusty) as the rooms are much nicer. The staff I dealt with was friendly and helpful (walking maps, suggestions, taxi-hailing).  Although I'd reserved a king they offered to switch me to a larger corner room with two queens so I could enjoy a view.  Glad I agreed, for two reasons:  1) the view;  2)  with two beds in the room it meant I could do one of my favorite things to do when traveling & staying alone in a hotel - build a big downy bed-cocoon in one bed using the pillows and comforter from the second.   And honestly....The beds.  ROCKED.  Their matresses have some sort of brand name like 'Hypnose' or 'Hypnotic' or something like that, and they were.  The pillows were perfect, the comforter was light and downy, and the high-thread count sheets slid against my skin like, well, high-thread count sheets.  I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings on the first night, but I did here -- thanks to my high-thread count bed cocoon and the perfectly quiet environment (I was on the 15th floor, which might account for the silence). The bathroom was dandy, the complimentary robes delightful, and the view charming.  After getting back around 10:30 or so from my biz-event on Friday night I did find myself wishing they had 24-7 room service of some sort.  I was hungry and tired but had to wander down to the attached restaurant, Fornetto Mei, to try and snag something to bring back to my room before the restaurant closed...and it was about to, so mine was the last order of the evening.  Ended up getting a room temp pizza that was just 'meh.' The Whitehall's location is superb, particularly if you're like me and you decide at the last minute that you don't want to wear what you brought to wear to the event you have to be at in three hours.  I just strolled across the street to the shopping plaza that houses Bloomies, Banana Republic, a freshly opened Karen Millen boutique, JCrew, etc. etc., and had a mini shopping spree.  Lots of other posh, high-end boutiques in the area too if you're staying at the Four Seasons and have the matching bank account. * Fun Factoid?  (I should probably look this up before spreading potential misinfo...too lazy)   Someone at my biz event told me the Whitehall was famous as the hotel the Rolling Stones used to stay in and, presumably, party in and otherwise generally act like the Rolling Stones in, back in the day.";3;2;1;2;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

Despite my better judgment, I went to HotWire and selected a ""blind"" 4-star at $159/night in the Streeterville area, which turned out to be the Whitehall. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean hotel with friendly service and I have no doubt that 70 years ago it was one of the top hotels in the city. Unfortunately it has remained largely in its original state. The beds are comfy, the pillows are fluffy, but the place is extremely out-dated; almost as if you'd walked into a time machine. The elevators are tiny, bordering on claustrophobic, and if more than two people are attempting a ride, they will all become much better acquainted than they might have liked. The hallways are equally confining; narrow, dark, a little depressing. The rooms aren't large, there's no wireless Internet, the lamps are original fixtures with unchanged (and probably untested) circuitry-- as confirmed by a quirky switch on one in my room, that refused to turn on without some coaxing. Similarly, the bathroom telephone had a poor connection. Worst of all, my room smelled of decades of cigarette smoke. Horrible. The decor is somewhat dreary, definitely not warm. All of these are symptoms of a hotel begging to be upgraded. On the plus side, the location is great, my room was quiet, the staff was friendly, and the price was right-- although next time, I'll select the hotel myself, pay the additional premium for the privilege, and enjoy it perhaps a little more. This is definitely not the place to stay if you want something light, modern, and cheerful.";2;0;1;2;N;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

3/20/2012;T0HKsnRvnpjUTuqTbOC12Q;Y4Du3cllZ_gpNjzTvmeZ0Q;"Man, this place is really mixed. I'm giving 4 stars purely on value, bed comfort, cleanliness, and nice staff. If this place were a $1 more expensive, it would easily fall to 3 stars. OH, now the front entrance will make you FEEL like you are at a Hotel Indigo, but once you enter the elevator, it gos downhill from there. For a Hotel Indigo, lets get this straight, the decor is disgusting and flat out OLD. The floors are old, the paint and carpets are old. The showers also do a pathetic job of keeping water off of the shower floor (There's a very small amount of glass coming from the wall an the curtain will not help you cover the gap). You will be using extra towels to mop up the water spraying out. The bed was Hotel Indigo standard. Lush, comfortable, sheik, and of course covered with some of the most heavenly pillows around. The place is CLEAN. The staff here is also pretty amazing.  If someone could just remove the staff and beds, and then blow up the decor with something new (WITH new flooring) and the place would be legit. Still, for $155 including vallet parking with unlimited 24 hour entry/exit, the deal is pretty hard to beat. You can get great deals if you call the Hotel Indigo reservations squad directly as opposed to going thorugh an online broker. When calling in, ask for any room/parking special rates.";4;6;2;1;N;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

She still seemed bothered and definitely did not apologize.   Did I mention it was over 100 degrees and only one elevator worked. not for one day. or two.  It didn't work for 3 days.  I understand things happen, It seems that in the business world there is some sort of compensation.  or at least an apology.

Also, we pretty much all found the front desk staff pretty unhelpful.  When we were checking in it seemed like they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible, and when we asked for them to call a cab in the morning, they called one and said that we should wait fifteen minutes outside, but it might never come.   We paid $179/night during the week and about $250 for the weekend.  We went to the ""Pump Room"" for drinks, and wished we had stayed there.  It was reasonably priced and very classy because of a recent remodel.";2;1;0;1;N;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
6/23/2008;ct27P83Y17bf5uSLcoGgcw;DiFrVAA1p5UVu7rjPzrZxg;"Hotel Indigo is an upbeat hidden jewel in the sometimes stuffy Gold Coast hotel district. In the earlier half of 2006, (while most of my friends and I were still trapped in the burbs) we'd frequently look to Hotwire to find a hotel when a friend's couch was unavailable. On St Patty's Day weekend in 2006, I ended up booking a room at the Hotel Indigo for a friend, myself, and any others that should straggle back to our hotel that night. When we arrived we were taken aback by the look and feel of the lobby. It felt more like residence than a hotel. The decor seemed a little more personal as if someone had built the room piece by piece. The elevators were the old style kinds with grates and although quite sound (they weren't rickety) they slightly triggered my fear of suspension. Truthfully, it could have been that combined with one of my friends jumping up and down once he realized I wasn't a fan of elevators. Ass. The hallways are brightly painted, but not done so that it appears tacky. Again, I felt like I was visiting a large home more than a hotel. This feeling was magnified once I saw my room. Although it had the same 2 beds/mirror and sink combo/separate shower and toilet room setup as most hotels, it felt like a bedroom. I tend to prefer neutral colors in decor, but somehow all the oranges, blues, whites, purples and yellows worked together. Dare I say this, but this is just a damn cute hotel. Unlike previous reviewers I didn't get the beachy vibe as much as I felt cozy and comfy. The staff was also very friendly. We didn't take advantage of room service, but they did look the other way as a bunch of 23 year olds checked in 15 additional guests (my friends are poor planners!), 3 24 packs and a visible beer bong. They were equally as non observant when we boisterously arrived (half of us on piggyback) back at 5am. Hey - St. Patty's fell on a Friday that year. I'd definitely recommend Hotel Indigo for visiting parents (I have a feeling that most mothers will adore the setup) or a nice couples getaway if you can't particularly get away from the Chicagoland area. Hey, sometimes it's nice to shake it up. The location is walkable to many attractions and the Clark/Division (Red Line) and Division (Blue Line) stops so if you can pry yourself out of bed (that bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in) almost anything in the city is mere few footsteps away. I posted a few pictures from that weekend to show room decor. You're going to want to keep in mind that this was St. Patty's Day.";4;7;3;4;N;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
12/14/2008;MZWZ5Q5xmA6aYJO8CIVSfQ;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;"Eh. I wasn't impressed during my recent stay at the Hotel Indigo. Oh sure- the location is great- just blocks from Old Town, and the lake. And the bed was comfortable. And the price was okay at $172 for a king room. But this place, while it calls itself a ""boutique hotel"" lacks the service and amenities of a true ""boutique hotel"". The front desk check in was a hassle, and the staff was unconcerned about the wait and as I stood there- I watched them deal with other guests in a nonchalant way that a true ""boutique hotel"" would not. Hotel Indigo looks it was decorated from Ikea with it's bright blue walls and green and white striped accents with simple wood furniture. I don't know if they were going for a beach theme but that's what it reminded me of. The room was tiny- so much so that the bed took up all the space and you bumped into the wall to get into the even tinier bathroom.  Maybe there are better rooms in the hotel so if you go- don't get room #514! But the real kicker here had to be the tiny bar in the front lobby. I went down to have a drink and the bartender told me that they didn't have much liquor. What? She then held up the vodka bottle and swished it around so I could see that there was barely a shot left in the bottom. When I asked her about it (knowing I was staying at the hotel with people who like to drink) she just shrugged and said an order must not have come in. Really? And there is no where in Chicago to buy some liquor to take care of your guests? Parking runs $36 per night at the garage next door (that's another review but the headline is- if you can find another place to park you should go there) All in all- I guess Hotel Indigo is fine for a basic hotel stay but I hate that they promote it as a ""boutique hotel"" for along with that label comes certain expectations. I won't be recommending it to any of my friends who come to town to stay. For the price- there are lots of better choices.";2;2;2;5;N;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

Pros: 1. - LOCATION! - Could walk to Old Town, State/Rush for night life, the beach, even to downtown if you have your comfy shoes. 2. - Decor! - Loved it! - Very unique! They are so proud of their decor, that even have a page in their hotel booklet of things in the room you can take home with you as a souvenir, and how much each item costs. I'll tell you what, that gave us a good laugh!!! 3. Have Aveda Products in the room, that was nice to use instead of typical generic junk. 4. Staff was great! - Very friendly! Cons: 1. Overnight Parking - $36.00 2. Save $40.00 and book online with Expedia/Priceline. I called in the reservation and they added all these taxes and fees that otherwise would not of been there. So I got SCREWED with the bill at checkout. (That $$ otherwise would of paid for the parking.) Would I go there again? Heck yes! - Great for girls weekend!!!!

The rooms are pretty big and look like you're in some tropical resort.  The beds are really comfortable and you couldn't hear noise from outside or other rooms at all.  We got there much earlier than the posted check-in time (we took a 7 am flight from Boston) but we were able to check in, go to our room, and leave our luggage with no problem. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood, and it's really convenient--walking distance to many attractions, a few blocks from the Red Line, there's a grocery store and drug store (the drug store sells alcohol) a few blocks away, and there' s a Starbucks right down the block.  Bonus points for that, I need my iced mocha in the morning!";5;2;0;0;N;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

The hotel decor gives it a beachy feel.  The beds were very comfortable and the common areas were kept clean. I believe this hotel accepts pets as the room next to us had a dog. My only gripe is the lack of ""cheap eats"" in the area. I used yelp a couple of times and found a great breakfast spot not too far from the hotel you have to check out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/….

No more, no fewer. I don't know how the heat distribution works here but I would've thought that they could channel some of that energy expended on making the corridors into saunas (seriously I have to wait until I'm in the lobby to put my coat on or I'd boil in the lift) into heating some frickin' water. Secondly, my TV does not work. I only discovered this tonight as I had previously been too embarrassed to ask how to turn it on (it wasn't plugged in, but there were two wires and I followed the wrong one and... it's embarrassing, I confess). I was right to not ask because the front desk man was rude and unhelpful and told me there was a switch and there wasn't. The TV sounds like it's got some doppler effect going on, but I'm sitting still. Sometimes there is no sound. SOMETIMES THERE'S LOADS. I don't even particularly want to watch some strange show about tim roth reading the body language of psychotic criminals (can someone tell me what that is??) but at least if I turn it on I'd like to hear all of it or none of it, not half of it. If you open the fridge just once, it hums all night. I think it's to keep the dripping tap company. Again, rant over. I'm still giving it three stars because I understand it's bloody good value and having just got out of the cold shower, talked to a rude man and turned on the broken tv, i'm not in a very objective mood. but really. no.";3;4;4;4;N;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

I must have gotten a non-renovated room because it was really small, dingy, the hair dryer didn't really work and everything inside was a little on the small side, all these small nooks and crannies made it uncertain what exactly it was I was supposed to use. Overall check in was easy, check out was easier. They held the bags on the last day since my flight out wasn't until late. The place was mediocre priced but for the room and the amenities that I received, I would have expected it to be even lower. The location is great but sort of overshadowed by the Hancock building. It's easy to get taxi's from this area as it is right near Magnificent Mile. There was nothing bad about the stay, but it was definitely unimpressive and could have been better in some ways taking note of the price.

The service, however, was excellent.  I interacted with 3 or 4 different people at the front desk during my 2 night stay, and every single one of them was courteous and friendly.  They don't offer extensive concierge services, but they are able to book architecture boat tours through Wendella, which is nice to save you the hassle of getting to the ticket office early and booking a tour.

I met them in Chicago for my Dad's birthday and wanted to be nice and pre-pay for one night of their 2-night stay. First, there were problems with billing over charging me and customer service BEFORE we even arrived for our stay. I called four times to the hotel to ask about the charges and no one ever got back to me until i had to go to the website and write a comment. I spoke with Director of Operations who really did nothing to apologize for the mistake or make any attempt to rectify the situation. When I asked for my parents to be compensated for one of their rooms for one night during their 2 night stay I was told that it was a ridiculous request and it was the equivalent of ""asking a mechanic making a car payment for you because you dinged your car"". Instead I was told he would think of some way to make it up to my parents when they checked out on Sunday (which never happened). They credited my credit card for the amount they overcharged me so I still paid for one night of the 2 night stay. When my parents checked out on Sunday, November 14th, not only were they charged for 2-nights, but for 2-nights worth of parking for 2-vehicles. My parents only had one vehicle. The Manager that was on staff spoke with my parents and told them that I was never there to sign for the charges to my card and therefore I was never paid-obviously a lie. By the time that everything got cleared up with the parking and a few other problems with the other rooms under my mother's name- the manager offered to take off the charge for one of the nights of their 2 night stay (exactly like I requested but was denied-again an unreasonable request). My father asked for a receipt and documentation which the Manager reluctantly gave him. So now for a THIRD TIME we are being overcharged. I already paid for one of the nights of their 2 night stay yet my parents paid for the same night since they were given the second night stay free. We will never be back to this hotel again it was a horrible experience even BEFORE we arrived and you had another chance to improve customer service during our stay and failed.The only genuine apology I received was from your accountant.

Checking in was a speedy process in which we were given the skinny about the parking (less than a block away), check out time (11 AM), and breakfast (7 - 10). The first clerk was ok, not terribly friendly, but not rude or hostile. Our room was a nice surprise. The bedroom was separated from the living area, which was nice. The bathroom had checkered tiles on the walls with cubed windows which added more character to the hotel room . The room was very clean and fully stocked. The only downside to my stay was slow internet speed. When I spoke to the first front desk attendant, he seemed to have the attitude that everything was fine and I just needed to deal with it. Which is an OK answer for me. But, the evening manger Jeremy was very informative, telling me that the hotel was fully booked, he already had contacted ATT, and I wasn't the only guest to have mentioned this. That's how you handle a complaint. Jeremy the night manager was very courteous, funny, and informative.

Here's the other critical part of our experience:  Anyone who says you can ignore sounds from ""El"" trains next to the hotel is lying.  The noise in rooms is brutal.  You hear everything -- trains pulling in and out, conductors' voices, door-closing chimes.  We also woke up to construction outside our window from 7am both weekdays of our stay.  Rooms don't seem to be soundproofed, so sounds almost seemed amplified. Some less important points, but equally unpleasant:  Housekeeping was lazy, leaving towels strewn on sofas and cabinet doors. I've never stayed in a hotel where the cleaners didn't return towels to the bathroom, or just replace them. FInally, the property's in poor shape.  While the lobby's clean, the facilities in general feel more ""hostel"" than ""hotel"".

The only annoyance was that eventually at night the room overheated to feel like a sauna. And because the windows couldn't open I had to turn on the A/C to balance out the Mojave Desert.

I discussed the issue of getting a quiet room with the front desk clerk upon check out.  She informed me that though I might request a quiet room, there was no way they could guarantee one for me in advance. I emailed the hotel after having left with a summary of my concerns.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt email from the general manager apologizing for my inconveniences, offering a credit as compensation, and requesting that I call her.  I did call the GM, and she explained to me that the hotel had been working with the yogurt shop on noise issues.  Further she said she would talk with her staff as to how to better accomodate guests wanting quiet rooms.  Desired room types are not always available on the quiet side of the hotel.  In closing, she requested that I call her personally to arrange any future stays at City Suites. Given the gracious and generous response of City Suites' management, I will definitely give the hotel another shot.";3;0;0;0;N;WA6coAKLoKnMWMKYKOibLQ

We were in town because a family member had been in an accident and was hospitalized at Illinois Masonic (4 blocks away).   We found out that City Suites has a special rate for that circumstance, so if you are in that situation, be sure to ask. We feel as if we found a ""second home"" in Chicago, and while no nice hotels in the city are inexpensive, this was well within the ""reasonable"" range.   Very relaxing ambience in a hustle-bustle neighborhood  helps to make this a winner, too. Both nights we got the ""last available"" room, so book ahead.  It's not a large property.   In reading others' comments, it appears our room locations must have been advantageous regarding the noise issues.   So ask about that when you book. Finally, the comment about ""quaint"" (including TVs) is puzzling.  They must have been doing some updating in some or all of the rooms.  We had a suite both times, both had sleek flat screens, and the furnishings and linens, etc... were in the category of ""chic"".";5;2;1;0;N;WA6coAKLoKnMWMKYKOibLQ

I paid rather more then I would for a room like this anyplace else, but it was still the cheapest place in downtown Chicago for the night I was in town. The lobby is very pretty and well taken care of. The upstairs floors are dark and rather worn, but still fairly well cared for. The room was small but it was just me and my suitcase so I didn't care. You could hear the trains from the room, but they weren't disruptively loud. The biggest complaint I have about the room is that despite it being a non-smoking room starting about 10pm the room started to smell very strongly of stale smoke. Running the fan/AC didn't help and the windows were painted shut so there was no way to get fresh air in the room. It only got stronger as the night went along to the point where I started to get a migraine from it - needless to say did not actually get much sleep. It was a fantastic location for me to go out and wander from though, and they have a secured and guarded parking garage across the street for those that drive in. Alo free and surprisingly good internet service! Staff for the most part was friendly, except I was looked at like I was from another planet when I asked about the possibility of early check-in.

The staff that I dealt with was nice, friendly and helped with directions but service alone doesn't make up for the lack of aesthetics of this place. The elevators took forever and make questionable noises, the hallway to the room reminded me of something from The Shining and the room was not nice. Thank god we were only staying there for one night because I don't think I could've done longer. The bed needed to be replaced, along with the pillows and itchy comforters (blue light what??), the curtains on the window weren't even long enough to cover the window so we couldn't get total darkness when we wanted to take a nap. The shower was decent but the window to the curtain in the bathroom ended up falling down and it looked as if someone put it up there with bubble gum to fix it previously. Plus, you could open the window with no screen from the 11th floor. Thank god I was in a right state of mind the time I was there!

There were iron burns on it and it was filthy. The room was very noisy as we were on the same level as the elevated train, which corners by every 6 minutes. The room was large but most of the space was wasted due to a terrible layout that put one of the beds blocking the entry to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but there was literally no surface space other than the floor to put anything. They put the tissues on the desk because there is nowhere to fit it in the bathroom.

I stayed here three nights while scouting out Chicago for the first time for a potential future conference. The rates are reasonable (you don't need to pay for parking at $35/night; just take the ridiculously easy and affordable public transit everywhere), the staff is friendly (enough) and the neighborhood is super convenient to anywhere and everywhere you want to go. I didn't see, or miss, a continental breakfast, a gym, a sauna, a doorman or fancy flat screen tv's. Three of us shared a double room and did get: 2 beds, 1 refrigerator, 1 microwave, 2 closets, 1 tv, 1 clean bathroom, a great view of the city and plenty of space. Like I mentioned, it's close to public transit--the red line is wicked close, and the blue, purple, brown, pink and green lines are all within 4 blocks. If you want to bus anywhere, there's tons of buses that come ALL THE TIME, and if you want to walk, well, bundle up if it's January. Doable, though. More often than not, a hotel room is just a place where you crash when visiting a city. For that purpose, the Travelodge gets a super firm thumbs up from me.";4;3;2;0;N;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

There was some kind of sewer gas leaking into every crevice in the building that created the aforementioned stink. The bathrooms were disgusting. And again with the protein-stains on the bedding. Um, okay hotels...people F-CK in your rooms, okay? They're going to leak their nasty juices all over your sheets so STOP BUYING WHITE SHEETS FOR YOUR BEDS! If there's going to be dried spooge on my bed, I'd at least prefer not to see it. Writing this review is a waste of my time and yours.

I get that it is an inexpensive hotel, but you would think that with the amount of business it gets and the location the management could have done something to make the place more appealing (hairdryers in the rooms, people, hello?). I might also add that the noise from the elevated train was unbearable and, between that and the flimsy door with equally flimsy deadbolt, I got around 2 hours of sleep the one and only night I stayed there.

It had since then become my go to hotel if I ever need a room on short notice. The hotel is very old but not in a musty, gross, dilapidated, scary way. You can tell that it must have been such a grand and luxurious place back when it originally opened. The lobby is so beautiful with its mosaic work. No it has not been update or renovated very recently but it has been very well maintained. In fact I actually like the way the rooms are just as they are now. I find the Congress very charming, warm and comfortable. It's very clean and all of the staff have always been accommodating and courteous. That being said I do think they must have some sort of deal worked out with Exchequer because both times I asked the concierge/door guy/bellhop he suggested I go there and gave me a voucher for 15 percent off my meal. And this place has terrible service! So I can't imagine they would suggest you dine there unless there was something in it for them But that's another story. Congress also has a pretty decent location on top of everything. Maybe I'm just biased by the sentimental attachment I have to it but I think it's a wonderful hotel and would definitely recommend it. :)";4;2;0;0;N;QnWFR5zQuLGL12EM_SZb8Q

The room I stayed in had 2 queen sized beds and was quite roomy.  Some small complaints that I have are that there is no safe in the room, and there is no bathroom fan. The service was wonderful!  Upon arriving, we used the parking valet and as the bellhop helped us into the lobby, I realized that I had left my wallet in the car.  The bellhop ran outside and chased down the valet, and I had my wallet back within a minute.  I don't normally use valet parking, so this was a very good experience for my first time.

There was food everywhere, plus the room had a microwave and fridge [jackpot! ramen night!] I didn't really like the beds, at all, though I don't remember what the beds were like at the one in NYC but these had really uncomfortable duvet covers that were all scratchy, and the beds were weirdly soft, even when I adjusted it to firm.

Inspite of the construction on the corner of State and Grand, the exterior was still well swept, nary a noise was heard through the construction, and inside the lobby was wonderfully appointed. On the inside however, the hotel was suffering from the need for a makeover, much more than new beds could ever offer. It looked like any Marriott from the late 80's and 90's, our two queen suite even being overlooked by a Marriott hotel, likely giggling whenever we opened the windows, saying to itself ""Yeah. I remember when I looked like that. Good times."" The front desk employees weren't much help (aside from the Consierge). Despite a clearly labeled 3pm check-in time, our room wasn't ready at 3pm. In fact, it wasn't ready at 4pm when we'd returned to the hotel after a few drinks in the attached Weber Grill. The front desk employee who'd asked if she could help us rolled her eyes when I asked if our room was ready. ""Sir, we're very busy,"" she replied. ""Your room is marked as cleaned, but there's something they need to replace in housekeeping. Let me call them."" Two other people approached the desk and were told the same. I stood up after a half-hour and glared (I'm good at glaring) slightly. The girl, with a lobby full of people, disappeared for a while. The consierge, who's name I didn't catch, smiled and nodded at me. He cleared off a luggage cart and told my son (who's name he'd heard once in passing, which shames me more for not remembering his) to stand there, and he'd be right back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and came back, nudging me. ""Ask her again if your room's ready. I'll betcha it is,"" he said with a wink. I did. It was. We were on our way. As for the room? The best I can say is that it was a place to sleep. I certainly didn't feel as though I was in the lap of luxury, though for the price I paid, I certainly shouldn't, either. Still, their wannabe Sleep Number bed is for the birds. The lowest setting is just flat enough to emulate a more than worn-out mattress. The highest, firmest setting was marginally harder than concrete. The middle setting was non-existent. I didn't sleep well, but, I did sleep. Would I stay here again? Sure. If I were on a trip with family, I would absolutely stay here again. The pool was nice, if small. The attached food options and location are wonderful.

I would give this place a 4-5 star review, if they had their internet working AND that they do not have any technical restrictions using a wired/wireless router based on the MAC address of the device (mainly linksys and netgear, and tried all the tricks such as cloning the Mac address or spoofing it or forcing the router to act as a bridge), and that their staff (or this one tall clerk) was helpful and committing. Unfortunately it wasn't in this case. I'm just pissed that I brought a router for nothing as I'm finding out later that this hotels ISP have restrictions against bringing your own router and sharing the hardline with other computers, and that you can only go wired thru the hardwire connection. So we were going to connect thru the hardwire by plugging and unplugging the ridiculously hard to connect ethernet cable, then all of a sudden it went down too. But still I wanted to use the wireless linkys off the hardwire to use my iPhone 4s facetime capability to FaceTime with my family thru my dads iPhone 4 while out of state.... but didn't.. However, several other desk clerks told me the internet was through ATT, so I think they need to end their relationship with ATT and get another high speed ISP that will not go down, no matter how many tenants and what holiday. However, we can use their ""conference"" rooms internet wire connection. We'd have to have someone unlock it every now and then. OR there's the business center with 3 computers and its only those computers you can use and not plug in your own, but 1 out of 3 terminals As far as the room (double double queen), it's good enough for our stay. Had cable TV (no premium HBO or anything) and a nice small type of dining area with a loveseat and two chairs, and a small round table.. Bathroom was in good order, and had a 5th floor room with a good view. A couple of desk lamps have an outlet so you can plug in small things to charge like your phone or mp3 player. Speaking of outlets, there's probably more than enough and wasted some luggage space bringing my own power strip. An ironing board, dryer, and iron were all provided and all worked. Everything was clean, and no wrinkles or loose rolls in the rug, housekeeping does come by once in a while, though it's a Vietnamese lady so you're just going to have to point what you want or just say no thank you waving your hand shaking your head. Downstairs there's restaurants and a bar area. The bar area is fine, though we mainly went out to eat than going to the restaurants downstairs. This place is near walking distance of the CTA (red line, cermak/Chinatown). Anyhow, all I can say is don't rely on an internet connection at all if you decide to come here. Just stick with mobile web browsing on your smartphone using your 3/4g network or tether it to your laptop, use a 3/4PCI laptop card, etc. That's this hotels main concern.

If you're new to the city and aren't street smart, this isn't the best place to stay.  If you've been here before and are used to far south of the loop, it's definitely worth it!";2;0;0;0;N;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

The Bad: It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. That's pretty much it right there. You're literally on the edge of everything and to go anywhere, it's either a mile walk, or a short cab ride (something I loathe). There's no coffee service in the room, no room-service. If you want anything to eat, you either have to take a cab somewhere, or order delivery from one of the local establishments. For those, like me, who stayed there to save money on he Hyatt (if you're attending a trade show), it's a very brisk 15 minute walk/trot to the Hyatt, and if it's cold, I wouldn't recommend it. So far, the only real plus that most other casual traveller hotels don't have, is a really deep tub to soak in (that was nice!).";3;1;0;0;N;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
1/29/2011;Ew96MoO-twPPWtN1nlXotA;G749ekHJc2qRfkrC2VjUNA;"I stayed here for a night this past December. The room was OK, fairly clean and pretty spacious. I picked this hotel because of the price (one of the 'best deals' I could find for Chicago area hotel that didn't seem like a complete dump) and the somewhat decent reviews I found on the Internet. I was on the top floor (5th) with a decent view toward the city and McCormick convention center. The neighborhood is not the nicest but I walked around at night and felt fairly safe. There aren't really any restaurants or stores within walking distance. I did walk to a Walgreens and to Chinatown at night but it was quite the walk. Better off taking a cab or hopping on the ""L"" train around there (the train runs parallel to the street right in front of the hotel). The gym/workout room was OK. The Internet in the hotel didn't work several times during my 1 night stay. Nobody had any idea as to when it might be working again. Besides a restaurant and a bar, there is also a small coffee/sandwich place in the building but it was closed several times although the hours shown on the sign said it should've been open. There is also a small store and a salon. A word of advice....stay away from the bar in the hotel! I can't comment on the restaurant across the hallway but the bar (SL Sports Bar & Lounge) is a complete joke...if this place weren't located inside of a hotel, they'd be out of business in no time. I decided to eat there at night because it seemed convenient. Although 2 bartenders, the manger AND the owner were behind the bar, not one of them bothered greeting or even acknowledging me when I walked in or even after I was sitting at the bar for several minutes and the same happend with several customers who came in after me. To order something, it felt like customers had to either beg them for attention or get angry and cause a ruckus, despite the fact that there were 4 people working behind the bar and only about 12 customers in the place. The place really wasn't that busy and by no means trendy enough to have any kind of attitude towards its customers. It was a plain, no frills hotel bar. One lady next to me got so angry about the fact that she was continuously ignored by the employees, including the manager, that she asked to speak to the owner ""Tony,"" who then actually tried to weasel his way out of having to deal with her complaint by telling her he was not the owner, despite the fact that the bartenders had already pointed him out. What a joke...have some pride (or at least the slightest bit of business sense) and try to make things right. After he finally admitted to her that he was in fact the owner, he tried to play ""Mr. Smooth"" with her, asked what the problem was but, at the end of the conversation, still made no actual attempt to rectify the situation. The chicken sandwich I had ordered to take to the room with me sat on the bar counter for close to 10 minutes until I insisted that one of the bartenders check whether that was my order and so, naturally, it was cold by the time I got to the room to eat it. I didn't think you could screw up a simple grilled chicken sandwich but this place still managed to do it. It tasted like somebody had cooked it over a week ago and the fries weren't any better. The chicken breast was partially ""rubbery,"" partially dry and partially burned on the outside. Conclusion...you're better off eating a sandwich out of a vending machine than spending your money in this place.";3;1;0;0;N;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Stephanie returned my email and confirmed my reservation. However, when I arrived, I was told the room I reserved was unavailable, and that they would substitute another room. The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool. You don't just forget that you are renovating your entire hotel. They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit. This is the worst possible service, deliberately lying to your customers. Although the room I was given was very nice (and larger than the room I asked for), my attempt to recreate a previous special getaway was ruined. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, because the mansion is very beautiful inside, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was also great. Everything about the place is relaxing and luxurious. This could be such a wonderful place to visit, but I don't feel I can recommend it to anyone because of their current management.

Earlier this week, I stayed here for my very first grown-up-all-by-myself-vacation. I booked a room for 4 nights two months ahead of time so I could get a really good rate. I only spent $89 a night. I booked through the Embassy Suites Hilton website, not through Orbitz. For a Downtown hotel, I wasn't expecting too much. And I was a bit frightened that it would be a bit gross. Apparently, that was NOT the case here! This is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at! I know it's not super-fancy, but it exceeded my expectations! I stayed in a 2-room suite with a flat screen tv in the living area and one more flat screen in the bedroom, a sofa-bed in the living room, Crabtree & Evelyn shampoos and soaps, plentiful towels, 2 additional sinks (one in the bedroom and another near the microwave and fridge), self-fluffing pillows, a very clean bed with clean, soft sheets, free cooked to order breakfast and a free 2-hour evening reception at the hotel bar! The free breakfast and the evening reception isn't over the top, but it's free! I'm so happy they at least offer it! The breakfast was very good; you can choose what kind of eggs you want or get an omelet, and they also sausages, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cereal, english muffins, donuts and other baked goods, fresh fruit (melons, bananas), yogurt. They had an awesome selection in case you don't want what they are cooking. I personally thought the omelets were pretty good. And there is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. The kitchen staff, bartenders, and housekeeping staff were all very nice and they made sure I was taken care of. Seriously, who could ask for more?!?!?! There is only 1 downside, wifi isn't free. It's $14.95 a day. It is free if you are an HH member. But it is worth it if you pay in advance for a lower room rate. I would definitely come back again and again for a quiet weekend. Or maybe a week. I love that Fox & Obel is around the corner too in case you want gourmet eats without spending too much $$$. But that's for another review....";5;7;4;6;N;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The location is not quite as convenient as being directly in the loop but it is very close and near enough to many shops, restaurants, cafes and the lake. The value proposition here is two fold: firstly, the room, or should I say rooms, give you more of an apartment style set up than a typical hotel room. The key here is that because you have a living room and a kitchenette area separating your bedroom from the hallway, blocking out the vast majority of noise from passer-bys. My bed was huge and comfortable. I had a view of both the lake and the city. The second area they really stand out in is the extras: all you can eat breakfast, and a two hour complimentary happy hour in the evening at the bar. Combine this with a 24 hour fitness center, a pool and sauna and it is pretty difficult not to enjoy your stay here. The staff, especially in the dining area, were exceptionally friendly. As for the drawbacks. The carpet was ugly and the interiors themselves were drab and in need of an update. The fitness center could use an update too. The style of Embassy Suites means you have a view of the exterior of all the rooms all the way up to the top floor from the lobby. Because they all look exactly the same you get the feeling of looking up at an old tenement building in a former Soviet bloc country.

7/20/2010;Emol7mqMYZFMESfVm1Tuow;v6nsU587W-PTTla8KcAcXg;"Spent this past weekend in Chicago and stayed (with 4 ""young adults + husband).  Booked two rooms, the kids stayed in one, hubby and I in the other.  There was plenty of room, even with 4 in a room.  Kids complained that pullout sofa was uncomfortable, as most of them are, but in the end, they slept pretty soundly as evidenced by the fact that we had to wake them up each morning!   The real draw for us was 1) location - within walking distance of Navy Pier, Michigan Ave. and many of the major attractions, and 2) free buffet breakfast and happy hour.  Buffet breakfast was pretty eh, the made-to-order breakfast (omlets, etc. are a better option) and the nightly happy hour gets so crowded you almost WANT to pay for your drink if it makes the line move faster.   Also, don't go there looking for top-shelf - it ain't happening!  They really should figure out some way to make this run more smoothly.   This property is somewhat older, but it is in very good condition; rooms and public areas were very clean and service was top-notch.  We arrived about 2-1/2 hours before the 4pm check-in, but the rooms were ready and they allowed us to check in early.  The elevators are a little on the slow side, particularly during the breakfast buffet and evening happy hour, when everyone seems to be wanting to travel at the same time.";3;2;1;1;N;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The suites are well maintained and clean.  The bathroom was updated with granite counters; unfortunately, they didn't update the whole thing and the wall paper was peeling a little, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Otherwise, the bathroom was fine. Love that they had a microwave in the room, esp. with all those HUGE Chicagan portions!   Really loved that they have a managers reception with free drinks and snacks at 5:30 - 7:30.  Helped me finish some reports before i starved to death before dinner!   The gym was ok, on the small side, but it had most of the equipment one needs.  The pool was a lap pool, but there were kids in the pool that didn't treat it as such, so i didn't try it out. Breakfast was fast, lots of choices.  Overall, a great location, great price and good service.  Only thing keeping from the 5 star rating was that the business center was incredibly small (3 computers, one printer) and they charge for internet which i think is ludicrous in any hotel!";4;1;1;0;N;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

Kids loved it, and if the kids are happy . . . .dads happy. Location is great - especially if you want to walk along Michigan avenue pre-Christmas.  Navy Pier is also just a couple blocks a way.

In addition to the great employees, the breakfast each morning was great - and this is coming from someone who isn't a big breakfast eater!  Seriously, all these complaints about it being busy are RIDICULOUS.  Obviously it's going to be a happening place with all the options you have - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, omelettes, cereal, donuts, pastries, yogurt, fruit, soda, milk, juice, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns... How could you not be happy?!  I was there on a Saturday and Sunday morning which I assume would be busier than weekdays and both times had no problem finding tables. Now on to my cons... Parking.  Parking is $49/day.  That's probably normal for Chicago hotels, but still... that's murder, and a very pathetic way to spend $100. Exercise room.  The room is TINY and has like 5 cardio machines (3 treadmills and 2 ellipticals or something like that.  I really don't remember since I didn't get to use anything).  For a hotel of this size, that's ludicrous.  I ended up going for a jog outside in rainy, 50-degree weather which wasn't ideal, but whatever. Room issues.  None of these ""complaints"" are a big deal, but I'll share them anyway.  The sitting area/office room that you walk into is pretty big.  It has a flat screen tv, desk, etc.  (No free internet...)  And then there's the bedroom - it's small, or at least seems small thanks to the huge bed.  There was probably a foot of walking space on each side of the bed so it wasn't easy to do anything but sleep in there.  I left my suitcase, got dressed, etc in the other room.  Also, the tv in the bedroom is the old cube type...kind of strange to still see those, especially with a newer tv in the other room, and what was even stranger was the extra sink in the bedroom!  So random. Also, taking the elevator to the lobby then the lobby elevator to the ground floor was interesting, but nothing to hold against the place. 5 stars - 3 stars for cons = 2 stars plus 1 star for an overall good experience and being a ""good deal"" (minus the parking) for a total of 3 stars.   It was fine, but I'm not sure I'll stay here again.";3;0;1;0;N;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The free continental breakfast is okay, but I don't think it's as impressive as some previous reviewers mentioned. Definitely eat there before you start your day, but don't expect a gourmet experience!

Very convenient downtown location, close to many things, including public transit (we took the bus, train and free trolley - which was sadly discontinued by the city yesterday).  There was a fridge and microwave in the room, which came in handy after visiting Chicago restaurants, which served Chicago portions.  (Also to keep the beer cold - buy that across the street at Dominick's/Safeway.) We stayed over the X-mas/New Year's holiday and the place was swarming with kids.  It made the manager's reception (free select drinks and bar snacks for a couple hours) a little difficult since half the bar line was ordering ""kiddie cocktails"" aka Shirley Temples.  A staff member commented that the place was always like that when school's out.  The breakfast was also a little chaotic, but worth the wait.  Cooked to order omelets and biscuits & gravy were hits with us.  The pool and hot tub are open until midnight, which was nice.  Parking at the hotel was expensive, so we used cabs, public transit and walked as much as the cold allowed. Surprisingly, the hotel charges $10/day for WiFi, so go across the street to the Starbucks inside Dominck's where WiFi is FREE.  Also, you don't get to opt out of housekeeping, which was a little weird.  And the ceiling fan was disgustingly caked with dust, which was also a little weird.";4;1;1;1;N;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The alarm clock comes with a plug to hook up your ipod. The beds are really comfortable, I slept like a rock. Our room was on the 12th floor and the view was amazing. It is also worth mentioning the elevators are made of glass so the view from them is pretty good too. We did not have any of the made to order breakfast so I can't comment, but the other stuff was well put out and no lines. We do the managers reception (did see long lines) either.

Tons of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. My fav restaurant was Bandera. The only thing that I didn't like about this property was the $42 per day for valet parking. I think this is on par with other hotels in the downtown area, but that still doesn't make me like it. I parked at the public lot next door to the hotel for $30 per night (another steep price for parking) - this lot doesn't allow in/out. I walked everywhere or caught the train, so next time I probably wouldn't even rent a car. As mentioned in other posts for this hotel, the Fire Station is right next door and I heard the fire trucks every day. They were loud, but luckily they weren't going out frequently.

There were a lot of things I liked about it, and I will probably stay here again, but it could use some improvements. The Hampton Inn is truly within walking distance of everything we really needed. We drove from Detroit, parked the truck, and only used it when going outside of downtown. We walked the magnificent mile, we walked to Millenium and Grant Parks, we walked to Navy Pier, I walked to get Kolten's hair cut. It's in a great location! Parking: never cheap doing valet! But for $42/day....We were staying here for 3 1/2 days... and it's just not justifiable in my book. I opted for the privately owned parking lot across the street for $25/day with unlimited in-and-out privileges! Note: cash only! It was impossible to get a smile out of the owner too. Valet/Bell Hops: great during the day! They saw us coming with the stroller and opened all of the doors =) At night, we were pretty much on our own. That's not a true complaint, but it should be more consistent. Breakfast: continental breakfast! The hot foods changed each morning but the rest was still more than enough to fill me up before starting out our day. Fresh fruit [grapefruit, pineapple, and oranges], box cereal, muffins, bagels, juice, coffee.... a definite plus when vacationing! Price: Excellent for the amenities offered!! Remember to book it with the discount [AAA, etc] to ensure the price quoted reflects the discount. They even allowed late check-out without any extra cost since no one had booked our particular room, which allowed us to get in some last minute stops without driving around with all of our goodies. Pool was a great way to get Kolten used to swimming and to wind down in the afternoon. It's not olympic size but there is also a jacuzzi tub and steam room in the pool area on the 2nd floor. Hotel key entry. The room itself: -industrial view. We were not blessed with a city view. More like the alleyway, but that's okay- we wanted to see the city up close and personal..not from the room window. Plus, when we were in the room, the shades were closed to drown out the light, to lull Kolten to sleep. -Major plus for mom's/traveling with young ones: kitchenette. FRIDGE, stove, microwave, dishwasher and sink. Perfect for storing Kolten's gallon of milk, drinks, fruits, string cheese, and all of our water and snacks! I was really relieved when the honey mentioned we would have the kitchenette!! -living room partitioned off with solid french-like doors. The doors needed some serious WD-40! It made the most obnoxious loud screech whenever you tried to open it. It was useless to try to open them quietly without the monster waking up. The teeth clenching and eye squint didn't help either! -Couch, a chair with ottoman in the living room and another identical set in the bedroom, 2 flat screen TVs- one in the living room and one in the bedroom, desk and office chair, kitchenette table and chairs, coffee tables, etc. Keep in mind the furniture isn't ""dingy"" per se, it could use some updating, or maybe a good steam cleaning. The upholstery looked kind of grandma-ish. -The bed- king sized with white linens and breakfast tray. This is where the magic happens...LOL! Surprisingly, this bed didn't give me the hee-bee-gee-bee's like some hotels have in the past with their floral bedspread and nasty blankets. This my friends, is comfy, clean, and crisp. Notes: 1. When up in the morning and getting a slow start, remember to put the ""Resting"" tag on door....or else the housekeeper will get a peek of your goods coming out of the shower! 2. When tilting the 1 1/2 yr old back in the office chair and spinning it around, always check underneath to make sure it has both bolts... or else the back falls off along with the child. Thankfully, he was alright, and the manager on duty came up apologizing and filed an incident report. We also got a replacement chair. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends, if they weren't looking to stay in a penthouse-style hotel.";3;6;4;5;N;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

I found all these intriguing hole in the wall places you can't experience when you take the taxi. King Suite - King size bed with tv, breakfast tray, and privacy doors. - Personal bath and closest with a security safe. - Living room to host your local guests. - WI-FI (so I yelp when I get back to the hotel room at 3:00am) - Kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, and small dining table with chairs. Complimentary Breakfast each morning from 6:00am-10:00am - Its not Denny's but its enough to get a big breakfast before I started my tourist day.    Now I do compliment the hospitality of the morning servers...they're friendlier than Denny's. - Okay.. its not that great.   Mostly pre-made meals like waffles, processed eggs, and a juice machine.    But I enjoyed the fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits, and sausage. Service & Hospitality - They got it down.   Smiles at the lobby.    I know I should have told her in person, but ISABELLA ... You're freakin HOT!   Thanks for helping out with my room selection and your smiles at the elevator!   * yes, i can't stop smiling when i think about IT!  * - Firm greetings by the bell service.    Easy to load and unload upon arrival or departure.    They got the great connection for taxi service and local recommends. Other Amenities & Services: - Tiny lap pool (worth visiting if you want to spend time alone and distress). - Fitness center - Skip it!  Way to small to declare it a workout center.   You're better off exploring Chicago on foot. - Luggage Hold:  Thank you Nathan for securing my luggages while I finalized my downtown Chicago visit.    This helps alot when you have a busy schedule. Drawbacks? - It's next to a fire station.   So at night, you might get the sirens depending where your room is at. - I wasn't lucky enough to get a great view of downtown Chicago.   I opened both my windows and saw a great big business building.   Argh! No major complaints here.    More compliments!   I spent about six hours a day at the Hampton Inn.    I didn't need a five start hotel because I really need a place to get some rest, keep my drinks cold, shower and change, internet access, and SPACE!    I really hate staying at crowded hotel rooms.     So this was a perfect palace for me.      Cleanliness and excellent service exists here (we'll that's because this was a King Suite).     So I officially crown Hampton Inn as my official Chicago hotel to stay.   I'll be checking in again soon in Spring 2008.";4;5;0;0;N;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

I booked a room at the Hampton because I'm a point fanatic for all Hilton properties.  Plus, it was right around the corner from Rockit, which is where I wanted to have dinner.  How convenient!  It's a good location, overall, for people visiting the city. The parking here is like $40 for 24 hours.  Not too bad for RIver North, I suppose.  There's adjacent lots for cheaper, but I'm not sure how secure those lots are for overnight parking.  Staff here is super friendly.  Like, whoa.  I didn't know the service at a Hampton could be so awesome. I got a rate of $189 online.  That's a pretty great price considering you get two rooms, two tv's, a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and pull out couch.  It's way spacious, good for pregaming, and I think they give you free popcorn.  Rooms are clean, bathrooms are small, but functional. Hampton's also offer free breakfast, which are handy in attempting to cure your morning after hangover.  If you're lucky, you'll be there when they serve up my personal fav - waffles.";4;0;0;0;N;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

Air conditioning was also very flakey (coming in and out for no reason) on the hottest weekend of the year. The morning of check-out, two separate people came to the room before 10 am to ask what time we would be checking out (not to mention the maid coming twice to see if we were out of the room). After telling the two different people that we would be out of the room by 1pm, the manager then called *again to make sure we would be checking out. After paying full price for two nights at the hotel, plus drinks at the bar, plus dinner at the restaurant, we thought we'd earned the right to enjoy our last few hours in the room. Instead, we felt hurried out. When I expressed this to Emilia, the director of the front office, she responded that she was sorry, and had expressed our frustration with her colleagues. No offer for a discount on future stays with them, or even to take the $15 minibar charge off our bill. In a city with a lot of other hotel options, you'd think they'd take every opportunity to build customer loyalty. They definitely fell short, here.";1;1;0;2;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
8/7/2012;ngr7FS9Z3Vx8Z1DkoO4Scw;1QVVOztvsuQ_mVcIeAzY_w;"I REALLY wanted to write a bad review for this place. Why? Because I would love to go back. Confused? Let me explain. The staff at PUBLIC cares a lot about their guests. It shows in everything they do from check in to check out. One example of this care can be seen while scouring other yelp reviews. They have a staff member who replies to negative reviews and offers to be contacted to talk it over and, I only assume, offer something in the way of compensation with a free stay. This is business 101--please the people who have not been pleased--but is something you rarely see anymore these days. So I was really hoping to have bad things to say in this review so that I could receive such contact and get to go back to PUBLIC for another night. Sadly, my experience was superb all the way through. I booked hotel PUBLIC with my Visa Signature, since it's part of their Signature Luxury Hotel Collection. This was a great idea if you're able, because it means a 2 night stay will come with $100 food/drink credit, complimentary valet parking, breakfast and a late check-out. This will help you go even further in enjoying what PUBLIC has available. Their restaurant, The Pumproom, is a slight revamp of the Chicago classic. Photos in the lower level show the hundreds of powerful people from Chicago's history who would sit down there at ""booth 1"" where they could take calls at the resident phone. Prices were hi, as expected, but food was superb in flavor and presentation and they threw in a couple shotglass sized samples of their gazpacho soup, which was a highlight. They also have ""the library,"" which sports a changing coffee shop/bar, depending on the time of day you make it there. We brought a friend with us to enjoy cocktails there on our second evening and everyone was very pleased. Everyone working there is very kind and seems very sincere. They are able to work in what is obviously a high class environment without being snobby or snooty. Swell folks. The room was comfortable, nice lighting options, great water pressure, considerate housekeeping (even plugged my laptop in for me when they were in there). I hope to go back some day on my own dime, because the PUBLIC hotel is totally worth it.";5;0;0;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

The under-window air conditioner/heater was noisy: the fan rattled and the compressor made a distinct rumble that carried through the floor to my head on the pillow. It wasn't bad enough that I think it was broken; I think it was just poorly made. The bed and linens were fantastic, and I slept soundly after I turned off the heater. (Luckily the room remained a comfortable temperature anyway.) I was awoken in the morning, though, by a loud sound that I first thought was static from the TV or iPod dock. It turned out to be just the water rushing through the pipes as my neighbor took a shower. My own shower was just above lukewarm, even with the faucet open to full hot. The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case. I loved the design of the place, but the fact that they didn't do more to mitigate the age of the building and the resulting flaws would probably keep me from coming back.";3;0;0;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
1/22/2012;Nbc1H3dVQrVB0o8SS;d4MIsICnmeWPdlVOKf7svg;"I walked through the front door of Public (which is actually on Goethe, not on State) and immediately felt like I was in the middle of someone else's wedding or charity ball.  The entire main floor was hopping with hundreds of well-dressed people socializing, drinking and lounging.  Normally, this type of scene at a hotel is represented by a demographic in their mid to late 20s.  Not at Public.  Here, the social club is comprised of many people who are 40+, but still have it going on.  This is clearly the ""it"" place to see and be seen by the non-clubbing club. I checked in at the front desk and the service was very friendly and polite.  The elevator took me to my room where I spent a couple of minutes looking for the card reader slot.  I then realized that there is no slot, you simply have to flash your card in front of the plate on your door and it opens.  That's pretty cool.   Once inside the room, I took a quick look around and was immediately reminded of hotel stays I've had in other locations.  I saw flashes of the Mondrian (Los Angeles) with all the white on white on white hues.  There were hints of The W hotel chain with all the modernistic furniture and black & white photo/art accents.  As many people have said, the aesthetics of this hotel are incredibly appealing, mixing classic old school charm with very contemporary flair. As for the functionality of the rooms, we were less impressed.  We quickly learned that beauty doesn't necessarily mean as much when you realize that the shower is so narrow you can hardly turn around inside of it.  Once you get out of the shower, there are no robes, either.  The bathrooms also have no exhaust fans (or as some refer to them ""privacy fans"").   I needed to iron a shirt and pulled the ironing board out of the closet with the iron.  I then spent the next 7 minutes trying to figure out where to plug-in the iron in a space large enough to accommodate the ironing board.  The places where outlets existed did not afford enough space for the board.  I ended up pulling the ironing board into the bathroom and pressing my shirt next to the toilet.  Yes.  I did this. At one point, my wife and I decided to check out the Library bar next to the lobby.  This is a beautiful lounge with comfy furniture, a blazing fireplace and pretty people everywhere.  The waitresses were all wearing these super skin-tight black dresses with one bright silver zipper down their backs.  While they all looked sexy as hell, I began to feel sorry for them the longer I watched them having to lean in and bend over repeatedly in those very tight and slightly revealing uniforms.   Need ice?  You're in luck if you happen to be on the 8th or 17th floors.  Otherwise, you're getting dressed and going for an elevator ride like I had to do. Granted, it was the middle of January and very dry, but our room was incredibly full of static.  Everything we touched gave us a shock, including our bed linens.  We resorted to turning on the shower in an effort to steam out the static at one point. Later, we realized that because our room was on the 3rd floor and immediately above the main entrance, it gets quite loud.  As cabs pull in and out of the valet and drunken hordes of partygoers are coming and going at all hours of the night  several honking horns and ""whoohoo"" noises easily came into our room after we had fallen asleep.   We decided to order the room service breakfast the next morning and it was delivered quickly in nice brown bags with the Public's branding all over them.  Unfortunately, the delivery guy didn't bring us a slip to sign, so I couldn't add a tip for him.  I was forced to pull out a $20 bill and ask him for change...of course, he only had $7 on him, so he got a 50% tip on delivery.   Don't get me wrong.  This is a very nice hotel worthy of many accolades.  Service is top notch.  They spared no expense making everything beautiful to the eye.  However,  we experienced a few minor inconveniences in our stay that were worth noting here.  I think we'd definitely consider staying here again sometime, especially considering the great rate we received $125/night to be in the Gold Coast and Old Town.";3;3;0;1;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

From the moment we got out the cab, everyone was on their toes ensuring that our stay was comfy and stress free. The white plain but modern rooms were trendy and unique. Although it was close to nothing but white, the furniture around the room made the difference. The bed was so soft and comfy that I didn't want to get up - also because it was 12 degrees outside haha.

Or is it just a mirage in the shariah desert?   I booked PUBLIC hotel on http://bookaroom.com, loving the price and wanting to try something new besides the occasional Hyatt or Hilton. Being from Ohio and having lived in Los Angeles, I wanted something that was moderately priced, but had a trendy flair. As far as appeal, PUBLIC exceeded my expectations. I liked being greeted by men wearing trench coats and chuck Taylor's and being waited on by beautiful people in a Tom Ford add ( remember I did live in LA), however I felt a ltittle betrayed and left with slight bad taste in my mouth. Everything was great the free wifi throughout the hotel, the clean modern gym, the nice hospitality, but when I payed for the hotel two weeks ago, I thought that was only charge I was going to receive. They didn't mention that there was a 150 dollar holding fee and being that it was a debit card the funds were withheld. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the card I was swiping for shopping and eating was running empty. When I approached the hotel they were very apologetic and handled the situation very timely. I understand there was a lack of communication and telling people that their is a holding fee is something that is not top of their list. I am really not here to beat down on PUBLIC hotel, throw a few punches yes. I just wanted to warn people of this fee because if this happens again and you caught say a  ""New Yorker"" on a bad day, the hotel will not hear the end of it.";3;1;0;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

As you walk in, it feels opulent, some of the neo-classical and art-deco architectural elements are smoothed out with a soothing neutral palette. Service is excellent, both at reception, in the coffee bar and throughout the hotel. The lobby after 5:00p.m. can feel like party central, as it seems to be a hip after-work hang out spot - which didn't bother me, but it is a bit loud in the lobby in the evening. None of this noise affected me once I was off of that floor, however. The coffee bar is wonderful, too! The coffee is well-priced, and while it is a bit watery, this is standard across the United States. In a city that is known for its coffee roasters and coffee shops, however, definitely check out other places! Nonetheless, the decor is great at the coffee bar and the pastries they offer are not bad.

I booked on price line and got a very good deal, but when I showed up, they upgraded me to a one room suite on the 16th floor...which had the MOST amazing view of both the towers and a little picnic table and a cupboard for the dining implementry in a completely different room. The living room was done all in white and was gorgeously appointed.  The bed was a king size, low to the ground and extremely comfortable.  Very Asian in feeling, but Swedish in style. Bathroom was a little bit small, but well turned out.  There were two large flat screen tvs...I don't really watch tv, but I'm sure a sports fan or news junkie would have been pleased. The iPhone/iPod charger didn't seem to work for my 4G, but I didn't try my Nano, so I'm not sure if it was just a compatibility issue. I loved the location.  Only a block or two away from the Zebra Lounge...a funky little piano bar with a tiny space but an excellent vibe.  Also, only blocks away from th Rush/Division bars that stay open all night and on warm nights, which this was, is a place where people congregate outside regularly.  Good people watching. The hotel staff was INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating.  When I called at 12:30 am for a turkey sandwich and chocolate pudding room service delivery, they forgot or messed it up and, not being a very fussy person, I didn't bother to call back to check on it until 4:30am, where they immediately said they were SO sorry and could they please sendit up now, gratis, and also could they buy me breakfast in the morning?  Yes and yes, thanks!  That was the best 5am turkey sandwich ever.  :) I really loved my stay here and will book again in the future.";4;3;0;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

Overall, it was a very good stay. The place is quite clean (as it should be, since it's practically brand new!) and sleek. The staff was friendly, though no one went ""above and beyond."" The fitness room was great, and I really liked the location - walkable to the Gold Coast/Mag Mile area and an L stop, but in a very nice residential area rather than in an entirely commercial area of downtown. Some of the decor was a bit too Euro trendy for me -- I could have done without the fake animal skin throw on the chair in the room, and a real bed instead of an almost-on-the-ground no-box spring Ikea-type bed. But all in all, the room was comfortable, if small. Computer area and library/coffee bar in the lobby was a nice touch. Biggest complaint: My room was right next to the elevator, and all night, I could hear the clank, clank, clank of the elevator pulleys and the doors opening and closing. Next time, I'll ask for a room away from the elevator. Overall, a very nice stay at an unbeatable price.";4;0;0;1;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

Not only will I stay here on my future trips to Chicago, the hotel alone makes me want to come back as soon as possible! Here are just a few of the reasons why I love this place: 1. Every single staff person throughout the hotel was friendly, warm, and welcoming. (They must hire them all from a modeling agency because they are unbelievably good-looking too!) 2. The public spaces are not only interesting looking and luxurious but also comfortable! If I have to spend 3 hours working at my hotel, why not do so sitting in a cozy sheep skin-covered chair, next to a fireplace with a delicious coffee drink! 3. Speaking of drinks, the cocktail menu is interesting and delicious as is the food menu. I haven't eaten so well since... I can't remember when! And yet the prices are affordable! 4. The social scene here is very cool. People of all races, ages, and styles make for great people watching but the mid-western charm of the clientele made me forget I was rubbing elbows with the chic and glamorous. 5. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is just an acknowledgment that we are living in a technology world and should do so without limitations. Charging for internet is like charging for air. 6. Free access to the nicest gym I have ever been to: totally unique design, more pretty people, AMAZING classes, (I'm still sore!), and top-quality gym equipment. 7. Perfect location - walking distance to restaurants, shops along the miracle mile, and just steps away from the shore, (you can't beat that view!) I could go on but I shouldn't need to. Book your room now! You won't regret it.";5;3;3;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

While quite spacious as far as square footage, the area for clothing was tight, so would have been difficult with more than one person.   As often happens in the older hotels, the bathroom also was tight, small shower and very little counter space for hair drying make up application, etc.  Net is I would definitely stay here again as a single, but would look for something with more clothing and bath space if travelling with my husband.";3;0;0;0;N;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

The elevator/garage area is not very clean and is obvious that it's not been attended to.. No A/C, paint chipping, not a good look! Check-in: Staff was very pleasant and it was very easy and quick. Room: Very small! There is a small closet door that kept getting stuck- and with it stuck, you can't open the front door, so it was very frustrating.  Room was clean overall, but bathroom can use some updating. Also, the A/C / heater unit is extremely loud.. I kept waking up through the night when it turned on. Lounge: there's no lounge here. Business center: You can take the stairs down to the business center from the  lobby. OR you can take the elevator down, then take the stairs up to the business center. For someone traveling with a suitcase, I find it annoying that it's not on a floor where it has ready-elevator access on the same floor.  Not to mention that it costs to use the computer and to print; and the printer-on software wasn't functioning. Breakfast: It's one of the better breakfasts I've had! Eggs, potatoes, AWESOME sausages, fresh fruit, coffee, the usual. But the quality is much better than many other hotel breakfast buffets.

Not only is the Doubletree in a great location, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were nearly everything we could have hoped for.  The only thing missing in the room was a fridge (what is one to do with all that left over deep dish pizza?!?!).   The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Ave (shopping, restaurants, etc) and a 10 minute walk to the train station.  Also within walking distance (bring your walking shoes) are the Chicago River, Millennium Park, Grant Park, The Art Institute & Willis Tower. Although check in is at 3pm, we were allowed to check in at 1:45pm and were given some delicious chocolate chip cookies!   The room was cleaned nicely every day and when I requested a firmer pillow, the maid service brought not 1, but 2 pillows.  The concierge staff was helpful when it came time for dining and public transit recommendations.

5/28/2012;D6ZTUtt8NY3aAmz67JzWuA;vmSu6JE46KnzBenqX0nuFQ;"Stayed for a week for biz and pleasure.  As others have said, it couldn't be better located, within walking distance to shopping, sites, and restaurants. Housekeeping staff were fantastic, and always had my room cleaned and enjoyable to return to after sightseeing.   Check-in/out was easy, though they did accidentally give me somebody else's bill under the door along with my own.  Initially reading it I was thinking I'd been doubled charged for a couple days of my stay, but then realized it was under another name.  Front desk quickly resolved it when I walked it down.   Front desk staff were very personable and professional. The rooms are well-appointed.   I would only ask for two considerations: 1) wi-fi shouldn't be based ""per device.""  I signed up on my iphone to access email while on my bed, and then when I went to use my laptop to complete some work I became aware that I had to repurchase wi-fi for that, and, if I chose to, again for my IPad.  That would be $30 for the same person.  I'm sure there are some couples out there, too, that wouldn't want to have to pay twice to obtain their emails on different phones.  You could charge a room rate, and let it go at that.  Also, as another reviewer said -- what to do with leftovers from the fantastic restaurants, including the hotel's own?  The pressure sensitive mini-bar essentially eliminates the option of taking a soda or snacks out of the mini-bar to put something in (leftover pizza, dessert, my own bottled water, whatever).   I also had a problem with my room phone sometime after day 2 -- no dial tone and couldn't be used.  I ended up needing to call the front desk for something and had to use my own phone.  Told them while I spoke about the other issue that my room phone wasn't making calls, but they didn't send anybody.  A night later, I had to call the main desk via my cell to get connected to room service, and I mentioned again I was calling because my room phone wasn't letting me make calls; no action. One other disappointment: the fitness center.  Several pieces of cardio but only 1 leg option and a multi-function piece.  If somebody else was doing their workout when you came in (as happened several times), you're stuck with cardio.  I actually found a gym a couple blocks away that had more equipment and offered a 6 session pass so that I could get in the sessions I needed.  One plus though, the Doubletree fitness center is open 24 hours -- many hotels arbitrarily close at 10 or 11p.  Still, if a good workout is important during your stay, consider other locations. That said, it was affordable, even inclusive of a holiday weekend.  My stay averaged $160.  I had considered the Intercontinental two blocks away, but that was $75 per night more...may have been somewhat better appointed according to a couple biz colleagues, but why pay so much more if you can have an overall good experience for significantly less?  And cookies, too. =)";3;0;0;0;N;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

Beds- These beds are INCREDIBLE.  I must admit that although I was excited to be exploring Chicago for the first time, there were moments that I thought about how excited I was to get back to the hotel so I can curl up in the bed.  Yes, they were THAT amazing. 3. Location- the location is perfect.  it's right in the middle of shopping & dining, and public transportation...we had no problems getting around and catching buses within a block from us. 4.  The smell-I have no idea what scent Doubletree uses but I want to buy it in a bottle and febreze my closet, sheets, and apartment in this scent!!!

Only disappointing factor was the wifi situation. We wanted to look up some addresses but did not want to pay over $20 for decent internet speed. I was even going to go for the standard grade at $10 for 24 hours but it wouldn't let me charge it to my credit card, only the room (there was an option for it but it wouldn't activate).

Additionally, we got the ONE room on the 5th floor that is by the ice machine...not good. Very loud all night...not just people filling their buckets, but also water running in a pipe to fill it. It should be noted that the pool is OUTDOORS, so to use it in March wasn't possible. The description should make this distinction. There is an indoor pool to use for a $15 fee per person.

By the way, it did not have a nice view. All I saw was the building in front of me, which was all glass. I thought maybe our window was the kind of glass where we could look out, but no one could look in. No, I was wrong. I could see myself in the glass window of the building across from us. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty clean. The next morning, I had to print something for a conference, so I went to the business center, and the internet was (I think) about $6 for 15 minutes. They REALLY should NOT be charging to use internet in the business center. I understand if you charge for internet in the rooms, but really?? The internet was SO SLOW. It took 15 minutes to load http://gmail.com and open a one-page word document. I called the guy in-charge of this, his name was ""Eddie."" He was unapologetic and said ""people use this all the time."" Then he swiped his card on the other computer and asked me to use it, again same thing. It was SO SLOW and did not load. Eddie still did not apologize or anything. I looked for a fedex closeby and found one in the Marriott. It worked flawlessly. The next thing to happen was that my room key did not work. The REALLY RUDE woman at the front desk said, ""if you keep the key near your phone, it deactivates."" Well, I did not keep it near the phone, so I don't know why it deactivated. Also, there were two other people in line whose keys also were deactivated. Third bad thing: the showers are difficult to figure out. Seriously? You need instructions for the showers.

I really liked the staff here. Every single person I spoke to was very, very friendly and helpful and never appeared annoyed with us. The gym exceeded my expectations with their up-to-date equipment and clean workout area. The gym is essential to me because grease and fat in those Chicago style pizzas aren't gonna run themselves off my thighs. There's also a nice outdoor pool on the 5th floor.

I had a room that faced Magnificent Mile and it was such a great view to see the architecture at eye level and then look down and people watch. The room was really spacious and open. Shopping is at your fingertips and there are so many good eats around that you need not travel far. If you are looking to venture out a bit, the train is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Chicago is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their train system is pretty good too. This Marriott is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one. The concierge here is so friendly and even funny to boot. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not. It's a really busy hotel whether it's late night, early morning, or the middle of the day and you can kind of get lost in the mix but the staff is pretty attentive so even though you may feel like it might happen... it probably won't *Overall You get what you pay for. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side but the staff is as excellent as the location so if you're willing to pay for that then you'll be happy here.

I had some nice conversations with the good people of Starbucks and the valet guys were a huge help. Strangely enough my parking pass from Indianapolis was working in the garage attached to the hotel so it was free! Otherwise, I think it's a pretty hefty charge and the valets don't accept call ahead requests from the rooms. We were house hunting and so by the evening on Saturday we were dead tired.

Where the hotel fails: they try to come across like a boutique hotel, but are really just a Marriott-type hotel in knock off polyester boutique clothing; the walls are tissue paper thin and everything said can be heard; the doors slam even when you try to close them gently; they play sucky pop country music over the sound system; we had problems with our room safe, there was no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room; the shower head, a peculiar, bizarre, and intimidating two-headed device, had loose plumbing, the alarm clock was missing the backup battery, and other parts, our one room service order was screwed up, and a call to the front desk and concierge went unanswered. All of this for a premium price in the toney Gold Coast area. In this case, the positives do not out weigh the negatives, which is surprising since the Westin is part of the Starwood properties. Starwood markets their hotels as modern, urban, efficient, technologically advanced, and for some properties, edgy.

I asked if another room was available and he said he would call my cell to get us one as soon as possible. At 6pm there was still NO ROOM and NO CALL. Eventually I tracked down a manager and she said she would get us a room soon. At 720pm I we were able to put our bags in the room, but were late to our 7pm dinner, not to mention unshowered after a 6 hour drive and had to change clothes in the soon-to-be bride's room since ours wasn't ready. We were given NO discount even though our room was 4+ hours late. It was a horrible experience, every person I talked to was unfriendly and was not able to help, and it put a damper on what was suppose to be a special night. I have not heard from management despite trying to contact them. I will NEVER stay in a Westin again and will alert all my friends and family to never stay there as well. Simply unacceptable for a huge pricetag.";1;0;0;0;N;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
6/15/2011;F9iIKVUGjIzXokyEpCBaXg;3hWhXTkU83jsm3jIA-rkIg;"Stayed at Westin Michigan Avenue on my recent visit to Chicago. This hotel is decent, but certainly not great. It is conveniently located on Michigan and Delaware. Right in the Magnificent Mile area and across the street from the John Hancock Center. In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one! My stay wasn't all that bad. I'd say my initial interaction at checkin is the basis for my rating.";3;1;1;1;N;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

The fitness center was better equipped than I would have expected, judging from the otherwise older, outdated hotel.  Medicine balls, swiss balls, yoga mats, walls of mirrors, lots of cardio machines, all pretty new. If you're looking for a Miracle Mile hotel and this Westin comes up pricing less than expected for other hotels in the same class, now you know why.  So, if it's a luxe experience you seek, keep looking; but if you want a nice, standard Westin with a killer location, you'll be happy here.";3;3;3;3;N;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

Unfortunately, we didn't get to the Aquarium...:( In a nutshell, the room next to us was ""rented"" to a younger couple that used it for party central. In and out, people in and out, laughing, hollering, smoking in the room and in the hall . The smoke crept in, under the ajoining door and was quite strong smelling in our room. The worst of it was the ""relations"" that the couple were in engaged in. For over an hour, 1am-2:15am or so, we were regaled with the happy couple's ""fun"". We thought we were granted a reprieve after that...but no...THEN they were hungry and THEN they decided they wanted to make some calls on their respective cell phones...loudly. As other posters have said, the walls must have zippo for insulation, I could hear people opening a soda down the hall for goodness sake. Calls to the front desk and operator to complain went unanswered (did we catch someone on a break? was there a party? were they in the room next to ours, perhaps???). At 4am, with no hope of sleep and a strong thunderstorm overhead, we gave up....packed up and checked out. Only then were able to voice our frustration to someone at the hotel. He expressed sympathy and asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and then after a few minutes, with a manager a no-show, we opted to leave. They compted us our parking, which was helpful, but ya, in the grand scheme of things, it's a drop in the bucket.

I'm a stiffler for bathrooms and I absolutely must say that I'd probably eat off the floors of these bathrooms than the plate of some Chicago restaurants. The beds are big and comfortable with white linen and comforters. I, personally, prefer sheets with a little more pizzaz but it's a subliminal thing: white equates with cleanliness. So, I get what they were going for. I was very pleased with the cleaning services as well. I requested my sheets get changed at the end of the night -- because, of course, the beau and I dirtied em up acting like 12 years olds, jumping around like fools -- and it happened rather quickly. The cleaning lady even engaged in a nice conversation with me as she cleaned. Very pleasant. I thought we had a great view and I was quite sad we had to leave and venture out into the real world. I'd love to have known more about the extra amenities of the hotel, such as the gym. And, it'd be awesome if they could toss a couple of iPod radio docks in there for those who just want to enjoy the view and listen to some tunes.

Be advised though, this hotel has some of the same problems many older hotels have in Chicago. While this property has definately gone through a facelift to renovate both the public spaces and the rooms, you still have some rooms that are very oversized and not furnished with enough furniture.

We had some issues with the wireless internet; 40% connectivity is pretty low when you're paying 12 dollars a day for internet! We had to call our own company IT as well as the Westin engineer to get up and running. Conference rooms were nice enough, no AV problems. Continental breakfast was so-so. They also did a boxed lunch which was OK. We had them cater a social event too but the food wasn't anything spectacular. Would stay here again.";4;0;0;0;N;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

2/1/2009;rZhz9P2qB;XSLzmNxObUzuaIKxjBJ18Q;"I haven't stayed at this property in a while so it was time for a checkup.   Located at the north end of Michigan Avenue this property is all about location, location, location.  In the shadow of the Hancock center, a stones throw from Watertower Place and abundant, restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The last time I stayed here the management was totally inept and I ripped off a seething letter.  I was happy to be informed that the individual, who made my previous stay hell, has been relieved of his duties. Other than a long line at check in this property this property has improved by leaps and bounds. Long line at check in as staff was changing shifts. There is a dedicated Starwood Gold/Platinum line.  The G/P line was unoccupied as I waited in line and opened, alone with another check in, when I was second in line. The lobby and common areas are very clean, bright, well lit and maintained.  In the lobby they have a refreshment center right next to check in line. The room I was assigned comprised of a nice sized bedroom and corner parlor to make up a pretty large suite. The suite was large enough to accommodate several people. Overall First Impression, renovated and on par with the DC and Philly Westin's I've recently visited.  This Westin's Heavenly bed wasn't as firm as I like, but all the accoutrements of the Heavenly Bed was there.  The room is decorated in a casual modern decor and in good condition.  Décor is appropriate for Downtown urban hotel.  The closet was a bit on the tiny side, for a room it's size the closet seemed out of proportion.  The 27"" TV is a disappoint, but I understand that they will be upgraded to 40"" sets soon. There is ample lighting in the room and the room has large windows so there is a ton of natural light.  The workspace desk shares the ice chest and other items and could be a problem for some.  There were extra electric outlets in the room for those with lots of devices.  The room has a nice  view since it is a corner room.  You can see up and down Michigan Avenue.  No iPod docking station and a dated radio.  Starwood has to up it's game in this area. Very long narrow bathroom, but no separate shower.  I found that odd for a bathroom of this size.  While in the bathroom I could vaguely hear people in the hallway.  The bathroom has dual sinks with lots of counter space and great lighting. A heavenly bath but no separate shower. The parlor connected from the bedroom.  Walking out of the bedroom into the parlor there was a nice sized bathroom.  With amenities that matched the bedroom bathroom.   There was a large desk with lots of outlets and a great view looking south on Michigan Avenue.  The room is a nice size and has a sofa, two club chairs and few ottomans.  The is a Murphy bed and a huge closet.  In addition, the parlor has a Bose radio.   The housekeeping staff was adequate. I had the DND sign on the door and was never interrupted.  They replaced all items and toiletries on each night of my stay.  Received turndown service every evening. This Westin features a nice sized Fitness Center with up to date cardio machines & ellipticals, a smaller room with free weights off to the side. There is no pool or club lounge at this property. Free Internet in the lobby, $13 a night in rooms.  Signal was strong throughout the suite and suffered no interruptions. Did not use valet, as there is no car for a car in Chicago.  The hotel is convenient to public transportation, cabs are plenty and always ready right out the front door. FINAL IMPRESSION Overall hotel cleanliness: On par with other Westin properties and cleaner than the W's Staff attitude, conduct & support: Staff has greatly improved, over my last stay.  The staff has had a complete overhaul for the better.  Everyone was prompt and attentive. Location: Great location. Can walk to your office (if on business), restaurants, attractions, parks, and shopping. Would I return? Yes. Would I recommend this as family friendly? No. Good for business travelers? Yes. Good for a romantic get away?  Yes, nice rooms and spa services. Would I recommend for someone looking for Dining/Nightlife? Yes Would I recommend restaurant? NA Value for price paid? Good Overall property rating on a scale from 1 to 5 = 4.5 since there is no pool or lounge.";5;3;3;2;N;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

5/8/2012;JKlMPbGvhK7F;E8LXXkxl319x-LfucVhDvw;"I've stayed at the Silversmith twice and am planning on a third stay this autumn. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful each time I entered the hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. Each time I've reserved a room, I've requested to be placed away from the El train and have been accommodated.They upgraded their internet service sometime between my stays there in 2010 and 2011, and I had no trouble at all with the wi-fi. The hotel is in a GREAT location for visiting downtown Chicago. CTA trains that circle the Loop have a stop right at the intersection where the hotel is located. Millenium Park is just down the block, and the Magnificent Mile is approximately ten blocks away. There is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and for venturing further out, trains and cabs are easily accessible. I've stayed, and plan to stay, at the Silversmith during the Chicago Marathon. I'm sure the price is higher during this weekend, but when compared to other hotels in the area, even those officially partnered with the Marathon, the Silversmith was the best price and in a better location than most. The only reason I didn't give five stars, and I'm sure this doesn't matter to most, is that I feel they need to upgrade their TV's. I know, it's a minor thing, but if you're looking to keep the kids entertained or, like me, your looking to spend time in the room preparing for or recovering from a REALLY long run, the TV thing is important. I highly recommend the Silversmith, and I plan to continue staying there each time I visit Chicago.";4;0;0;0;N;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

We were there at 4pm, and check-in time was 3, so that's why I think there were still suites available for upgrades.  The room itself was older, but it did not have that smell of an older room. You can tell they take good care of their rooms. The staff were all friendly, and are eager to help us out with the easiest bus routes to certain places. I think I read reaviews on it could potentially be a bit noisy because the hotel is situated right next to the train line, so we requested a room away from the streets and got our peace that way. I could barely hear passing trains when I wake up in the morning. Again, I cannot rave enough on their location. It was our first time in Chicago, so of course we wanted to go everywhere, and this hotel was really smacked dabbed in the middle. It took minutes to walk to the bus stops that would take us anywhere south or north of downtown. I'm so happy we chose the Silversmith. p.s. free wifi and an in-room fridge definitely earn this hotel another half a star. This would be a 5-star review if they have a microwave in the room to heat up my delicious Chicago food leftovers.";4;3;2;0;N;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

I happened to leave something at the desk during check in (where others were checking in too) and as I entered my room, my phone was ringing and it was the front desk letting me know I had forgotten it there.  Neat :) This hotel wins for - Location (though I'm sure any downtown hotel would get a point for this!) - Price - not bad for the location.  About $200 a night. - Staff - unbelievably nice.  The bellman even went on a stroll along the streets with me to show me some restaurants and favorite spots since it was my first time visiting Chicago.

They are older, and the room we had was a bit too old for my taste. The bathroom was clean, but it didn't have the new industrial touch many other hotels I've stayed at did. While I like the location of Silversmith, I would still prefer a hotel near the Magnificent Miles, since the Loop isn't as cool at night.

We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies. I might have paid 7-10, but $15 for a movie was a little unreasonable.

The hotel and room is a bit dated, but as many have said, it is clean and the rooms are relatively large.  I was traveling alone, but if I was with others, the roomy bathroom would definitely be a plus.  My suite had large windows in the bedroom, so since it was cold, there was a bit of a battle between the heater and the coldness coming off the windows, but it was not a major issue.  As far as the train goes, you do hear it.  However, it's not noticeable if you are accustomed to city noises.  If you need silence, this isn't the place.  But that's not to say that it's noisy, either.  As a matter of fact, besides the noise you might expect from outside, it almost seemed as if there were only a few people staying at the hotel. The free internet was nice, but I did have some problems with it.  The signal was intermittent, so at times my screen would freeze when loading or refreshing.  It would definitely be nice if wireless was available throughout the hotel. USA Today is available on weekdays, but don't expect it on your doorstep.  I like a leisurely morning where I can relax and read the paper in the morning, so I was just a tad disappointed when the first morning I found out I had to pick up the paper at the front desk. A couple times, I had problems with my key card and had to get it reset.  Again, a minor convenience. Considering the location and what the hotel offers, I would say that overall staying at The Silversmith is a great value.  If you don't need the features of the bigger hotels offer and don't insist on modern decor, this may be one of the best hotels in the area in terms of value.";4;0;0;1;N;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

I'm a local- but I live in the burbs. I'm downtown for a conference and the hotel where the conference is was sold out, so I looked on TripAdvisor and Yelp to see about this hotel-- and wow! I've walked by here a million times probably and never noticed! How wrong I was! They have free Wi-Fi- which works like a charm - great speed. 24 hour Fitness Center (haven't checked out yet - will update later) and Biz Center.

Bummer. It was ok to sleep in but if they replaced the mattresses this would be perfecto! Now- I ordered breakfast this morning. I give it 2 stars. Mediocre-- not BAD mind you but nothing yummy.

I came to the city for a long weekend and wanted a place that would be central to the Art Institute and to Mag Mile shopping.  I am always baffled by the world of Chicago hotels, in which my options  seem to narrow to either a $600/night room at the Fairmont, or a Travelodge experience where I'm taking my life in my hands (but oh, so cheap!). The Silversmith hotel fills this void in the travel landscape serviceably, if not memorably. I'm not convinced I'd stay here again.I almost feel that if I'd had more lead time, that I could have found a nicer room elsewhere at a recognized hotel chain.  The Silversmith's rooms, although spacious, lack some of the more thoughtful appointments (to wit: the shower had only one slot for soap and the selection of toiletries could have been amplified as there was no showercap, shower gel, or hair conditioner). The decor was a bit of a hodgepodge--almost as though someone decided to clean out their storage closets/rec rooms in a bid to quickly furnish this hotel. The rooms did have a fridge and microwave, however, a boon for the budget-conscious or time-strapped traveler (especially with CVS at the ready). The hotel has a gym and business center and the bellmen are good about checking luggage and hailing cabs, which is always a plus.";3;1;1;1;N;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

I've also had experience in real estate, enough to know when a place is in good, clean shape and has great fixtures (I can't help but notice the little things). The ceilings were wonderfully high and the complimentary desserts in the lobby truly blew my mind. Amazing! I've paid three times the price for ""luxury"" hotels in Las Vegas that weren't even as nice as this.

The location of the hotel can't be beat, as it's on Jeweler's Row at the corner of Madison and Wabash; easy to get to and within walking distance to TONS of places, including the Amtrak station, Grant Park, and Michigan Avenue. Taxis, buses, and the El train are all very accessible as well, so getting just about anywhere is a breeze. Even better are the shops and restaurants just outside the front door, making it very easy to find anything you may need during your stay. The hotel itself is ""old world"" in style/decor, but the amenities are definitely modern: high-speed internet access, a roomy, updated bathroom, and a powerful AC unit are all worth mentioning. The rooms are on the small side, but that's to be expected given the hotel's downtown location. The only complaint I have about the room is regarding the beds, which were rock-hard. This is pretty typical for hotels nowadays, though, so I wasn't too surprised; it was just the only thing that kept the experience from being 5-star. FYI, our bed was king-sized. I've read there are some people who were bothered by the noise of the El train, which passes right outside the hotel. The key to this is to get a room at the back of the hotel, away from the street. That's what we did, and the noise was barely noticeable; it just sounded like it was raining whenever the train passed by. It's MUCH louder when you're facing the street, though, including when standing in the lobby. Just something to keep in mind when booking. Another thing to note is that the hotel does have several adjoining rooms. This was not something I remembered reading anywhere, so I thought I'd mention it; we would have taken advantage of that had we known about it. The staff was very accommodating and friendly, allowing us to check in early (around 1:30pm) and storing our bags after we'd checked out. They were also happy to accommodate our requests for change (bus fare), directions, and a move to the aforementioned adjoining rooms. (They weren't able to move us due to other bookings, but they were very nice about it!) We would absolutely stay here again and recommend the hotel to others.";4;0;0;0;N;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

My bathroom ceiling leaked (I was under the roof air conditioner) and it smelled damp and was always too cold despite my changing the temperature.

They moved me graciously and the new room was great.

If I had to nitpick I would say the gym is limited and the lobby is a little cramped (although to be fair, it is relatively small hotel to begin with).  Also, I have slept on more comfortable beds.  However, the free papers (including the NYTimes) and coffee in the lobby made up for it.   If one wants to experience classic décor such as marble stairwells and crown moldings with outstanding hospitality, then I highly recommend this hotel.";5;2;0;0;N;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

The picture windows are lovely; I was staying on the 12th floor with a view down state street out of one window and the park and lake out of the other.  Great for random people-watching too: I even caught a glimpse of a newly-married couple taking wedding photographs in the middle of the street down a few blocks in front of the Chicago theater! What made this stay particularly memorable was the exceptional service.  Staff members went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience.  In the lobby there is a wine social hour in the evening and fresh-brewed coffee in the morning (which I didn't realize when I asked the hotel to bring me a coffee maker the night before - oops!)  Prior to my arrival, I got a personal email from Suze, who checked in with me to ask about my room preferences, if I wanted them to book me a dinner reservation anywhere, and inquire about if I was celebrating any special occasions or had additional requests.  I was in fact celebrating an acceptance into grad school, let them know this, and there was a little bouquet of flowers with a congratulatory card awaiting me in the room.  I was also traveling with my infant daughter who is one, and had asked for a crib in the room - it was already made up and waiting for me when I arrived.  Also worth noting is I showed up in the morning way before check-in time, but the room was all ready set up and ready to go, which was a  nice surprise.  I really appreciate that the staff connects with its guests before they arrive - so many places just send out an impersonal automated email generated by their bookings page, and it was nice to know an actual human was taking care of me. The pictures don't do this place justice.  The building, the lobby, the staircases, elevators, and my room were all just breathtaking.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat if it weren't so expensive!";5;0;0;0;N;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
1/24/2012;zhi9t6Ob1;DMx9EJox_ZlUHgrQE5JvGw;"Me: ""I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel"". Typical reaction: ""What is that? A Marriott, Hilton, Starwood Hotel?"" For those who don't know, Kimpton is chain of 100 boutique hotels that are located in most of the major metropolitan cities in America and no, they are not associated with any of the major hotel brands.   In the hypercompetitive hotel service industry, I really think that there are only a few things that a hotel can do to stand out.  One, the hotel creates a once in a lifetime experience by charging an astronomical price (say...overwater bungalows in Bora Bora) or goes the bargain/cheap route for the price conscientious customer.  For most, anything in-between seems to be an experience that is soon be forgotten unless you are tied into a loyalty/reward system that makes you go back to a hotel chain. So what makes Kimpton hotels stand out? Simple.  They provide 5* service at realistic price points for consumers.   FACT: They have the highest customer satisfaction scores and emotional attachment scores of all hotel chains operating in the United States. How so? Service: 1)  As I checked into my room, I had a hand written ""welcome back"" card that specifically stated that they hope I enjoy my second visit.  I visited Kimpton 4 months ago for the first time, and they pulled this info and prepared for my visit before I checked in. Amazing. 2)  They called 10 min after I got into my room to see if I needed anything. 3)  Three to four hours later, an employee brings me a complimentary bottle of Chianti.  Unfortunately I could not have this b/c I had some important things to do the following day so he asked if he could bring me anything else to drink like juice or lemonade.  In 5 minutes, he brought me complimentary ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade.  Madness. Perks: 1) $10 bonus perk card for loyalty program members for every stay.  You can spend the $10 on anything in the fridge and in the snacks cabinet.  They have organic snacks, coke, beer, wine, chips, chocolate bars, you name it.  Although they are a bit overpriced, you can pick out 2-4 things without paying a dime.  Hey you can't complain b/c it's free :) 2) Rotating loss-leader specials.  For example, the Kimpton hotel chain is now offering 2 cocktails for $1 at the bar until the end of your stay.  Yeah.  Tell me a hotel chain that does that. 3) Complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning and wine and champagne in the afternoon (at the lobby). 4) Free wifi by being a loyalty program member.  This comes in handy in large metropolitan cities where all hotels charge for wifi. Add all these perks to a great bed that rivals the Westin's Heavenly Bed and fantastic decor to boot at around ~$110 a night.  It is almost impossible to find this kind of deal anywhere. The service and the quality of my stays has made me reconsider my priceline bidding strategies in the cities where Kimpton Hotels are located.  For a marginal difference of $20-$30, I am not so sure that the price difference warrants my risking landing an unproven hotel using priceline. As much as the service may not sound ""phenomenal"" for my review, my general feeling is that they would have gone completely out of their way and would have done outrageous things to make me happy.  I was sold.  Kimpton you won a loyal customer and a well-deserved 5* review!";5;7;4;1;N;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

Plus, you get a free 10$ gift card to raid their mini bar for doing this. I used it to nab a few snacks for my flight home. I notified them that I was checking in early and when I got there (around 4pm), I was able to get my picking of available rooms which included staying on their top floor: BINGO. The upper levels are maintained historically accurate to when the hotel opened in the late 1800's. Check out the old marble staircase; you can even see foot grooves on the steps! My room's window was huge! It felt like I was looking out in HD; everything was so crisp and clear. The room's size wasn't very big (reminded me of European hotels), yet we never felt claustrophobic probably due to the big windows and high ceiling. Also, we didn't stay in a hotel in the heart of Chicago to stay in and sleep the night away! The cleaning and reception staff were all very attentive and proper whenever I interacted with them. The hotel offers a bunch of stuff for free beyond the regular, complimentary soap, shampoo and conditioner. I borrowed a hair straightener (very clean!) and clothes steamer for FREE!

The hotel is located at State and Washington, and the view down State Street from our corner room on the 12th floor was awesome! During the Christmas season, the hotel is right across from Macy's and a block away from the Chicago Christmas tree. It's a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. So, walking around right out of the hotel was great and then catching a cab was trivial as well. It's a max $10 cab ride to pretty much anywhere, for example, Lincoln Park. The ambiance is boutique: small and casual. The service isn't snooty or smothering. The lobby is tiny with a fireplace and a couple comfy chairs. Our room was a suite but was still smaller than a more modern hotel. That was fine; it was a great setup and the windows on a corner room were huge. And yes, Burnham has the practicalities down as well... comfy beds and good shower/water pressure. The room had two robes in the closet a leopard pattern and a zebra. Ha! My only complaint... the tiny bar and cafe downstairs were hard to get into. We didn't make reservations for Sunday brunch at Atwood and couldn't get in. So be it!

The Burnham was probably my favorite of the bunch.   The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and the location can't be beat. Right on the corner of State and Washington with very easy access to the Red and Blue lines. When they finish the new building at 108 N. State there will be a new Blue line station and new access to the Orange line. That means the Burnham will have easy access to either airport. After reading ""The Devil in the White City"" I was very interested in seeing some of Burnham and Root's (& Atwood's) work first hand.  To have the opportunity to stay in one of their buildings was incredible. The Reliance Building is absolutely beautiful and Kimpton has done a great job of retaining the building's classic charm while adding their own quirky touch. I didn't have a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, as there are too many food choices and must-eats in Chicago to being with, but it looked great and seemed to be doing some great business. The upper floors all have the original office building doors with frosted glass and mail slots.  I believe they are on the 8th floor and higher. I was on the 10th floor and we had a great view north to the Chicago Theater and the river. The views to the northeast would be great as well. Our room was small, which is expected in a building this old, but very well decorated and comfortable. The beds and linens were great and having access to a pillow library, made the stay that much more comfortable.

Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... ""ask and ye shall receive"", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH! And I forgot to add, we stayed in room 1503, its as high as you can go and has great views of State and Washington, see for yourself from my pictures.";5;0;0;0;N;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

Hotel Burnham in particular is so well located when it comes to attending Chicago's Jazz Festival. Just two short blocks west of Millennium and Grant Parks. We were fortunate to have a corner room with views of State and Washington Streets. Views of the parks of course, Macy's (world's second largest department store), and the Chicago Theater. Everything is at your foot steps... The Jewelery District, Water Taxi, Magnificent Mile, parks, and museums. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the visit besides the great jazz was the Chicago skyline of monuments. Our room was extremely comfortable with properly scaled furniture. Velour head board with overhead sheer canopy, matching curtains scripted with Mozart tunes covering the bay windows that were screened with sheer french drop curtains for daytime privacy. Coffee & tea was available each and every morning and on Labor Day, there was an arrangement of donuts, sweets and bagels. That was to make up for the inconvenience of not having the lobby restaurant available. Hotel Burnham is also a designated historical building and once had the pleasure of a visit from Al Capone. Would not ever hesitate to recommend or stay in this hotel again in the future.";5;0;0;0;N;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

June 28, 2008... Leaving Grant Park after the most amazing FREE Stevie Wonder show. The music was still in me as I danced down the street with good friends and a bladder full of magic lemonade. The conversation included talk of hopping on the Brown Line and heading to Lakeview, but I knew I would never make it that far. The lyric in my head quickly had  gone from Stevie's "" All I do is think about you"" to that Detrol commercial's ""Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now"". I assured my friends that I would catch up with them later and mumbled something about going to Marshall Fields...I rushed down Washington St. on a mission. But I would have needed a time machine to visit the Marshall Fields bathroom, or even the Macy's bathroom (the store was already closed for the night). Feeling defeated as I stared through the locked Macy's door, I turned around and took a huge sigh of relief. It was the Hotel Burnham & Atwood Cafe. I remembered eating there, and having to cut through the hotel lobby and go downstairs to visit the ladies room. I ran across the street, but slowed down as I entered the hotel lobby and smiled at the front desk staff as I made a bee-line toward the stairs. There, at the bottom of the stairs was the bathroom, just as I had remembered. Afterwards, I walked out of the Hotel Burnham with head held high, and the ability to handle the train ride without the threat of a most embarrassing moment.

So I began my exploration of Chicago hotels. Love and hate. Hate the W Lakeshore for their pretentious, sometimes just mean staff. Love the Holiday Inn Silversmith for really nice and affordable rooms and the unexpected diner and weird, tucked under the L feel. Love what they did to 71 now as much as I hated prior to renovation (and that view from the penthouse rooms -- yea!). LOVE the Sax because you can get food from Bin 36 -- for reals, that is worth the stay (have breakfast there!!!). Love the Monaco even though is like every other Monaco  -- but the service is so perfect and what a location. Hate that giant Hyatt, love the Palmer house, love that place that USED TO BE the Nikko but is stil so nice. Well, anyhow, I could go on and on and on. I love the Burnham because the staff is wonderful at all times. I leave to go to the drugstore and they wish me well, I return ten minutes later and they ask how things are going. I love the tiny space you cram into for the happy hour wine. I love the nest of pillows I make in my bed. I loved the view of the Chicago theater out my wndow. I love the way the Atwood looks (even if food is spotty when too crowded).  I love my clunky hotel key clanking in my pocket. I love the frosted glass on my door. I love the metalwork on the stairs.

4/11/2011;cEp4pzRXFfXLt-qr1gFc;MzjGSHKbbH-z7FO8KM9_YQ;"I usually travel on a budget, but this Red Roof really drops the ball. Strike one: The rooms are not clean!! That's the most important quality about a hotel. Wouldn't you rather sleep on a slab on concrete in an immaculately clean room than a soft mattress in a room full of dust and dirt? There were large piles of dust in the corners in the bathroom, and the corners of the sink had caked on dirt. The grout on the floor was cracked and stained different colors. Most Motel 6s that I've been in are better maintained/cleaner than this room. Strike two: One of the elevators was broken. According to previous reviews, this is something that happens pretty frequently. For a hotel with 16 floors, you would think that they would have people on call for repairs like this, especially for a spring weekend when there are lots of guests. The rooms are a tight fit, but most rooms in metropolitan areas are going to be small.  The mattress was nearing the end of its life, and yes, the bedspreads are icky.  Our toilet tank was a little leaky, so the toilet would spontaneously flush itself when no one was in the bathroom. This place would have gotten one star if it hadn't been for the EXCELLENT customer service from the front desk. The people working there were patient and polite, even with a constant stream of guests arriving at the desk. We had booked the room through a third-party site, and the woman at the desk made sure that we had two non-smoking rooms next to each other and let us check-in early. They sent up extra pillows to the room when we asked. I was really happy with the service we received. The valet parking guys were really nice, too. Parking was $36 with in/out privileges, which was a better deal than parking in the garage across the street.  TIP:  If you park at that parking garage, the Courtyard Mariott gives out blue parking tickets to give you a discount on the daily rate.  It may be a little dishonest since you are not staying at that hotel, but if you're checking out a review for a Red Roof, then I have a feeling you don't have extra cash burning a hole in your pocket. Even though this is a great location at a good price, I would try to use Priceline or Hotwire to get a better room at a nicer hotel for the same price.";2;0;0;0;N;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng

The only two things that would have made it perfect would have been coffee makers in the rooms (there is a horrible complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which was broken half the time) and a business center where we could check our email or bank accounts online. Although the coffee situation sucked, there is a Starbucks across the street which was pretty convenient. I would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago who is on a budget.";4;1;1;0;N;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
9/9/2012;xXhD7i;_52iIbIsz6ME3zI7toOARg;"Ah, the Amalfi Hotel. I love this place. It is bang smack in the center of Chicago, a stone's throw away from tons of great restaurants and the Magnificent Mile shopping area. We got married in Chicago in May and we worked with Dan Wheeler and Moji Akinde as we had about 50 rooms for our friends and family booked here. Dan and Moji were great to work with ... very flexible with our numerous requests and always willing to make this experience easier as, with any wedding, it is one of the 100 things that we had to sort out but this was one where I was happy to leave it to the experts. Thanks Dan and Moji. The hotel itself is great. It is a boutique hotel which was what we wanted rather then the blah-ness of the larger chains. The foyer is amazing (and great for wedding photos). The rooms were large and very modern. The gym has lots of equipment and was seldom busy. To top it off there is also a breakfast buffet on every floor which was great for the morning after the night before when my heart (and head) was not into going out for breakfast. There is also a happy hour which complimentary cocktail and appetizers ... my friends and family did not miss a night here and it helped to make the hotel even more affordable. In summary the hotel is great ... central location, very reasonable rates, friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, complimentary breakfast and happy hour, free WiFi. Highly recommended.";5;0;1;0;N;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

The rooms are spacious, the beds, gosh, i wish i never have to leave it - extremly comfortable! And it is very well located. You are in everything's walking distance, north as much as south. Around the corner you fis a couple of nice steak houses, pubs n bars. The breakfast you got on the corridor with more than just the standard continental one. Further, you got free drinks in the late afternoon! I do recommend to stay here (will be #1 choice when i come back to chicago...)";4;0;0;0;N;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
7/15/2012;ahmMovkWTfX4LGn-vIpyzg;rvHR7L1RjDHdC6OGdGIJ-w;"The three major deciding factors in choosing this hotel over others in the area were 1) free wifi 2) free continental breakfast and 3) proximity to all the popular Chicago sights. Wifi was spotty in some areas of my second floor room but I can't complain because other hotels in the same price range were charging $10-15/day. While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago. Walk south for about 5 minutes and you'll be at the Blue line which gets you to and from O'Hare in 45 minutes. The Red line is also very close by. Although we did not ask for much, the staff was very nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of our keys not working and they were apologetic and immediately helped resolve the problem. Very satisfied with my stay here!";4;1;1;0;N;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

Good shower water pressure and lots of counter space. Plus a magnifying mirror and even a little stool that was a nice touch. Much more space than I expected for an urban boutique. Bed was comfortable and the linens were good quality. I like that they desk was a little lower so you could actually put your computer on it comfortably, and it rolled around so it was nice to position it where you wanted it. I could have used a few more outlets near the bed so I could plug my phone in, but overall, the room was very well put together. The checkin was efficient and the staff very helpful. The doormen were really friendly and didn't make me feel like their hand was constantly out for a tip. They do a breakfast buffet on every floor and it was MUCH better than I expected. It was great to just walk out and grab something. They have a cocktail hour that I never made it to - but will next time. I ordered room service from Harry Carreys across the street. This is a great idea since they don't mark up the food, and it's great. They do add an 18% gratuity and a $2.50 service charge, but that's totally reasonable. And it was very fast.

The desk staff is equally pleasant.  They couldn't have been nicer during check-in!  There were a lot of people waiting around, and while they were efficient about getting you settled, they never made you feel rushed. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and a good size.  Everything looked fairly new - they seem to do a good job of taking care of things around here. There's also a complimentary happy hour for guests starting at 5:30 and let me tell you - it is wildly popular!  At 5:30 on the dot, there was pretty much a mad rush of people going up to the Ravello Lounge.  It's probably a little less nuts during the week, but I'm betting the place was packed based on how many people were headed up to the 6th floor.

Good idea: happy hour, with good quality booze. Bad execution: the room only seats about 20 people, and in 15 days here I think I've been able to find a seat twice. Good idea: breakfast set out on each floor, and the coffee is really good. Bad execution: show up at 7:10 instead of 7:01, and it has been raided, with no idea when more might be coming, unless you want to go to a different floor. So-so: River North location. Close to lots of restaurants, but can sometimes be full of loud bar-goers who make noise at night. Just hope your room isn't within shouting distance of Public House. Not good: I think the night desk guy is snotty and not terribly helpful. Weird: room service comes from Harry Caray's.

The free cocktail hour was a very pleasant suprise. They had an extremely nice spread of food and drinks for this cocktail hour (including their house made ""Amalfitini""). They have fresh mozarella and proscuitto among many other things. When we went to the concierge to get a dinner recommendation, not only did she recommend something to us, but she knew someone at the restaurant and was able to get us 25% off our entire bill plus free dessert.

The location wasn't too exciting - I didn't find to much to do around the hotel, but at least it was safe to walk around at night. The rooms were your average sized rooms. Nothing big and spectacular - the beds were comfy, and I loved the dual shower heads and the aveda products to use. They have a 24 hr business center, free wi-fi in the room, flat screen tv, books, cd's and magazines for you to use in the room, a decent fitness room (3 treadmills, 2 elliptical's, 2 stationary bikes, and free weights), a complimentary happy hour from 5:30-7 which has drinks, snacks that include meats, cheeses, and bread to snack on, continental breakfast in the morning set up by the elevators on every floor, and newspaper delivered to your room every morning.

They had some magazines,which I love, waiting in the room for me, some CDs, and a very nice robe to lounge around in. The bed was very nice. I could have fallen asleep in it seconds after my head hit the pillow.  Oh yea, and I cant forget the the happy hour. The drinks were not all watered down as I would have expected.

We were in Chicago on business and needed to use the printer in the business center.  I called ahead before we even booked and asked about their business center.  They assured me that they had building-wide wifi as well as a printer that guests could use. When we arrived, I attempted to print 4 sheets of paper for an upcoming meeting.  The page was streaked.  Printer read: Change Black Ink.  So I called down, thinking it would be no big deal, and they happily said they would send someone up.  Okay.  I left for the meeting and went about my day.  The next day I went down to the business center and the printer was doing the same thing.  They never changed the cartridge.  I called the front desk and they assured me again that they would send someone up.  2 hours later, nothing had changed.  I called again and they said I could use the front desk's printer.  I went down and they very nicely printed off about 15 pages for me (though it was odd that the guy at the desk wanted to log into my email account himself... ""okay, what's your password.""   Umm, no.  The next day I went down to the business center to print our boarding passes -- three guys in suits are in there complaining about how the printer is streaking and says it needs a new cartridge.  Ridiculous. The wifi in the building is a joke. I was on the 6th floor and couldn't get a signal.  If you're on the 4th floor (where the business center is), then you might get one, so request that floor.  They had to send up an ethernet cable for me to connect to the internet. Finally, the breakfast was lame.  I understand you want to be able to advertise ""free breakfast,"" but the food was generally stale, especially the bagels.  It was nice to have free coffee, so I can't complain about it that much since I'm not big on breakfast.  If you are expecting even the equivalent of a Hampton Inn, you'll be dismayed. Despite this, the rooms were pretty nice and I have no complaints there.  If you're here for business, I can't recommend Amalfi.  ""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience at Amalfi.";2;1;0;0;N;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

The Almalfi had an advertised rate of $199 per night for the weekend...almost too cheap so we did more research just to make sure, read lots of great reviews so we booked it. When we arrived we checked in with what might have been record time for hotel check-in, it took all of about 1 minute or less. The Lobby is small but beautifuly decorated. When we opened the door to our rom we were pleasantly suprised, we were on the the top floor with a pretty decent view up and down State St. The room was on the small side but very clean, very nice decor and a comfy bed and a large bathroom big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. All in all an ultra bargain for a weekend room in Chicago. Our $199 per night rate included their complimentary happy hour cocktails in the lounge every night from 5:00-7:00pm as well as complimentary continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The hotel staff was helpfull and friendly and housekeeping did a great job. There are nicer places in the city but nothing in this price range will compare.

Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  Here's why... 1. The room was small and narrow.  It was ok for one night, but too small for more than that. 2. Noise.  Our room faced the alley and we heard garbage trucks , homeless people, hotel workers and people from the building next door all night long. 3. Age.  We are in our 40's and felt VERY old.  The average age seemed to be late 20's to early 30's. 4.VIEW....  The only view we had was that of the building across the alley.  I had read that  the views were bad, but bad is too nice for what you get.  I never thought I would care about views, but this was so awful that if we had planned on staying more than a day, I would have switched hotels.";3;0;0;0;N;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

Vancouver, Whistler, and, of course, San Francisco . . . so when coming to Chicago, we definitely stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The lobby is beautifully appointed, with the check-in counter on one side of the circular lobby, the concierge on the other, and ENO (their lobby bar dedicated to wine, cheese and chocolate) dominating the middle. By the time we got our bags and the cab took us from O'Hare to the hotel, Lynn and I didn't check in until around 7:45-8:00, but our room was (naturally) waiting for us, and the bellman brought our bags up to the room immediately (good thing, too, as we had 8:30 dinner reservations). Our room was on the 15th floor, with a spectacular view to the east, of the yacht harbor and Lake Michigan.  The pillow-topped mattress was perfect; the bathroom large and roomy, the shower good, the Bose sound system paired with the flat-panel TV sounded great; so did the iPod player, actually, that was built into the base of the desk lamp, and the room came with free wi-fi.  The mini-bar wouldn't open, but we didn't need it (see below) except to store leftovers in, and they immediately brought up a small refrigerator to our room. The room was also on the opposite end of the floor from the Fairmont Gold Lounge, meaning breakfast, cocktails, and a concierge were mere steps (rather than floors) away . . . It was a SPECTACULAR place to stay. Gawd, I love the Fairmont . . .";5;3;1;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

They: - double-booked our room - gave our non-smoking room to someone who came earlier in the day - only had one smoking room left in the entire hotel - would not give us any benefits in return (except breakfast - which we had already booked at a MUCH better place weeks in advance as well) - left stains, hairs, dead flies and dead mosquitos on our beds - AND the types of hairs that shall not be named in our tub - and then charged us an extra $70 (which they didn't tell us when we left, I had to find it on my credit card bill, and call them to have them remove the unwarranted charge) REVOLTING!!!!

Upon arrival the front desk lady was really friendly and was able to grant my wish of a room on a high floor (34th) looking out towards the lake. The view was amazing. The room was huge. The bathroom AREA was separate from the rest of the room. When I say area, there was a power area with its own mirror and bench, the actual bathroom which had a tub, a very nice stand alone marble shower, the sink area, and then the toilet had its own little closet within the actual bathroom. It was a little weird that there was no tank on the toilet and had a flushing system similar to what you would find in a stadium. This was really my only gripe. Besides that, everything was very nice. The TV was a 42"" flat screen. The bed was super soft with very nice pillows. There was a couch area with its own coffee table. There was a desk area as well. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, with about anything or any alcohol you could ever want. However, I'm sure everything in it was really expensive, i couldn't tell you for sure because there wasn't a price sheet, which was a bummer. If you need to use the Internet, be prepared to open your wallet cause it was $15 and some change per day for Internet. That too was a bummer. All in ll the place was great.

4/20/2011;lSB3jIM-WtfTb;7Fuk0MKLVFAi8iPGVst4_w;"Warning.  My stay here was compliments to my company a.k.a. I'm only writing this review on my stay and not making any judgments on price. I've stayed in Chicago before, near the Drake, and expected similar sized rooms.  In other words, small, like what you'd expect in New York.  When I walked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised.  If I was the one paying for this, I'd probably have my whole family staying in the room!  That.  Big.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but this certainly is a luxury hotel.  Walking in, I noticed the king sized bed and couch sitting more than six feet away from the bed. I then did the usual hotel ritual--looked through/at everything.  I ventured to the restroom and saw a standing shower (rain shower for the win!) and a separate tub.  The toilet was in its separate room as if this was a master suite bathroom.  There was also a vanity.  Nice! In the morning, I ordered room service--french toast with bruleed bananas.  While the service was really great (he ended coming back up to collect the tray without my calling) and helpful, I would say the bananas were a bit over bruleed.  But I guess that's just nitpicking. Although, if I was only rating this off of the environment of the room and room service itself, I would give it four stars.  Sadly, poor internet service and the area bumped it down.  First, the area: while not bad, there's really not that much to do around the hotel at night if you don't take a cab and don't know anything about Chicago.  Granted, that's just a qualm about living downtown, but still. Now poor internet service.  First, no free wi-fi in the lobby.  For some reason, I thought that was fairly common, but no.  $14 per day.  Though not bad, the service was SLOW.  I tried sending and receiving a few times from my work laptop and my iPhone (with AT&T's crappy service) got the messages and sent the messages even before they were received!  Muh. This was certainly a great stay for free, but would I return?  Mm maybe.  Then again..I live in Chicago.";3;0;0;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

9/11/2009;N1nOhMpvR706RCrFsKwMng;vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw;"I recently stayed at the Fairmont in Santa Monica so maybe I expected too much from this location, but at the Santa Monica location, my God, you're treated like a king.  It almost gets to the point of being a little embarrassing.  Similarly, this location positions themselves as a top tier ""luxury"" hotel.  Definitely not the case.   I'll start on the positives and work my way down: LOCATION: One of the best possible locations in the city, no question.  You're right in the heart of it all.     LOBBY: Great design of the lobby, very 'male'.  My wife suggested that they need some flowers to soften it up a little, of course I'm oblivious to a note like that, looked cool to me. The doormen were super friendly. ROOMS-LAYOUT: Very disappointed.  We walked in and were like, really?  This is IT?  Literally, it looked no better than a Holiday Inn, very small.  The furniture looked nice but it was form over function... literally, you get TWO drawers for clothes.  Hopefully you are traveling by yourself or your party packs SUPER lightly.   It's a little nit-picky, but why in the world is the TV lined up with the wall of the hallway (dividing the main room from the bathroom area) while the two-drawer seat is lined up with the end of the bed?  Maybe someone crashing in the hallway wants to watch some ESPN?   ROOMS-NOISE LEVEL: What in the world is up with the 120 decibel toilet?  I don't care that it looked like something you're see at a roadside gas station, but my Lord, when you flush it is insanely loud.  With our baby sleeping in the main room, we would try to not wake her; closing the outside bathroom door, closing the immediate bathroom door, and literally taking a robe, wrapping it around the closed toilet, hugging, then hitting the lever... and it would STILL jolt her awake.  I'm not even exaggerating. The doors close normally then - BANG!!  It just bangs shut, soooo loud.  You learn, after the first round of stink-eye you receive after you startle everyone awake, to ease the door closed... however, all night long, count on your neighbors' doors banging shut.  The walls were paper thin and it got annoying. SERVICE: This is were they really lost me.  Maybe it was just in our case but compared to the Santa Monica location, it really was like a 'get over it' attitude.   When we booked this two months prior, we were crystal clear that we needed a crib, which is standard (it was waiting for us in our Santa Monica room, even with toys!).  We called the week before as well as the day or so before to remind them about the crib, ""No problem.""  When we got there?  No cribs left.  Awesome.  I asked the worker at the desk, ""What should we do with our baby?""  ""I don't know what to tell you, Sir.""  I guess saying 'Sir' and 'Mr.' helps sugarcoat bad news. So the first night we had to sleep with our 11 month old in our bed, trying not to crush her during the night, trying to make sure she didn't quietly wake up and roll off the bed onto the hard floor.  This would have been a deal-breaker had we known they weren't going to come through on this.  On the second day, they finally got us one. CHARGES DON'T DRINK THE WATER!!!  They lock the mini-bar and you can only open it if you request the key, which we obviously didn't want.  At the Santa Monica location, however, they set out complementary bottled water.  ANY hotel puts tags on the water if they plan on charging you for this... not here!  The water's sitting right out there for the taking, no tags, no indication that they will be a charge, but get ready to pay $10.58 for two small waters when there is a CVS right across the street.  This is just flat out b.s., don't rip me off with something like this.  I called down, got a couple ""Sirs"" but they wouldn't take it off the bill. MISC: -There was a nail polish type of smell in the hallway every day. -$1 a page to print at the ""Business Center""!?  It's like $.05 at Kinkos (which is around the corner, thank God... my wife needed to print a 60 page script). -No free internet at this ""luxury"" hotel unless you're a member of the President's Club, which, fortunately, we were... sucks for other guests though.  Internet is standard these days, it's like paying for cable. OVERALL: I gave it two stars because one star would have been overly harsh, a one star is something like a Motel 6, but the rooms aren't that much better - no pool, bad service, constantly nickle and dimed.  What's the point of paying this price point?  A hotel with basically the same location and everything else is Hotel 71 (where my parents stayed) for about $100 a night, a fraction of the Fairmont.  I'd highly recommend that over this Fairmont. At the end of the day, would I come back?  NEVER.";2;6;0;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

8/10/2010;Uv-UUePGgeFLL;iDYw0nEWSE0GAXd3K9YBzA;"3.5 stars -- This is a nicely renovated hotel located in a pretty accessible part of downtown Chicago. Good business hotel, and perfect for our Lollapalooza weekend due to its proximity to Grant Park. The service staff are all professional and friendly. Two points to note: 1. I partied all night on my last night there and went to sleep at 730am - asked for a 1030 wake up call. They called twice, and of course I didn't hear the phone.. and because I didn't pick up, they sent someone to knock on the door and wake us up. That's service. 2. My friend B dropped his wallet at the entrance when he left for the airport before us, and they immediately tracked back to which room he stayed in.. called us, and told us to let him know asap. Good thinking guys! The reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I noticed that the bathroom wasn't cleaned that impeccably for a place that costs $300 a night. The towels were replaced and all, but the floor wasn't swept and the T.P. was almost not replaced in time. So that was the only bad thing. OH.. and they don't have a swimming pool. That's kind of a bummer. Internet also costs $15 but that's generally how it is with fancier hotels. AND.. they forgot to replace the tea bags that we used. Oh well!";4;1;0;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
5/26/2008;6k2tdUkhc;llyCvGHsiXgiTdVlX50iWw;"This is not so much for the hotel but for the ballroom on the second floor where we had a party, and then for the restaurant, Aria. For the party:  3 stars. We were welcomed into the hotel lobby, then swept up the stairs. All was fine until we walked into the ballroom... I've heard that there are a few beautiful ball rooms in this hotel, but this one was somewhat lacking. It transported me back to my days of bat and bar mitzvah's on the north shore of Long Island. Two big glitzy gold chandeliers, a small dance floor, mirrors on both sides of the walls, and... that's about it.  The ceilings were kind of low, too, and coupled with the dim lighting in this space, it felt kind of oppressive. Throw in  two severely understaffed free-standing bars (read: one bartender at each bar) with rude bartenders (probably overstressed, overworked, and underpaid), and you see why this event venue was a disappointment. For the restaurant: 2.5 stars. I'd read some good things about Aria, but having given it two shakes, I've decided I don't like it. For the price, you can easily find better food and a much more aesthetically pleasing environment. I will say, however, that they have a very delicious mushroom soup. I believe it's something like ""mushroom soup your mother never made."" I think my greatest qualms with the restaurant is the space. It's very long and narrow, making it awkward to maneuver around. Also, the restaurant is kind of divided into three separate sections - the front area for the bar, then a hostess booth hidden behind a wall, and then, as you keep walking, what appears to be another room. The layout is very awkward.";3;0;1;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

Pictures: http://www.facebook.com/… Categorically: A) Star Rating: PL ranks Fairmont as a 4 star establishment.  I am not sure what qualifies them to be so, but I assume it has to do with the number of amenities that are in the actual complex, not by the shape of the amenities.  I thought that for a 3.5 star hotel, Embassy Suites in Lombard was much more well-maintained and spacious than Fairmont. B) Location: Fairly decent location in ""Millenium Park.""  Since it is located close to where I used to work, I had no problems navigating.  A word of caution: the physically address listed is 200 N. Columbus, but if you actually look up where 200 N. Columbus is, it's the lower part of the street.  The auto entrance is there, but the main pedestrian entrance is upstairs on S. Water St.   C) Public Spaces: I did not get to check all of these out, but these are the ones that I did see and go into, at least to look: the main Eno Bar area in the registration area, Aria restaurant, and Aria Bar.  The lighting in all these areas was fairly dim, to a fault I would say.  Even the escalators that went down from the main lobby level to the ballrooms and parking area weren't the brightest, but they were much better than the other.   I will post my review of Aria Bar where appropriate.  Also included at the complex were ballrooms, a spa, and business centers as well as meeting rooms. D) Room.  The room I got was a double bed on the 5th floor.  Not much to say about the view, but I didn't have high expectations about that.  Room came with: safe, ironing board, extra comforter, a little mirrored/vanity area, bathrobes, the usual English ""boutique"" toiletries, separate rain shower and tub, BMI scale (did not use this, ha), a phone in the toilet area, LCD TVs mounted very well on the wall, art mounted behind the headboard, couch, and working desk/table.  Walls were not very thick, and I could hear other guests walking about, as well as the people next door who were initially fighting when I got there.  Babies. E) Service.  Had 2 with the registration desk.  When I checked in, the person on duty seemed frazzled because of difficult clients right before me.  He checked me in quickly enough, but forgot to tell me where the elevators were.  He did mention the restaurants though.  Upon checking out, it was also quick, and the staff person was very friendly.  As mentioned before, I will include service at Aria Bar where appropriate. Overall, a very good experience.  A little pricey for what it was even with the PL bid, and some of the infrastructure seemed a little old (see my pictures).  Would stay again if I had to, but would prefer the Embassy Suites in proximity to this hotel.";4;0;0;0;N;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

I'm just going to dock it one star for their false billing. They billed me for 5 drinks from the mini-bar and I didn't even have a key to it.When I called down to dispute it they were quick to apologize and ""we'll take it right off your bill."" Made me wonder if that's just standard operating procedure to sneak it by the unsuspecting few. I doubt it is but buyer beware. Anyway, outside of that everything was first-rate. We had drinks and delicious cheese at the lobby bar. They have a cheese flight to go along with an extensive wine list. It wasn't cheap, but, hey, it's the Fairmont. The rooms were spacious with full-HD tv's. Internet was extra but we didn't use it so, who cares. Oh yeah, no in-room coffee maker was also a negative. You'd think they could provide that if they're doling out robes and rain showers. The bathrooms, btw, were some of the best I've ever been in in a hotel.

There's two drawbacks to the Hyatt. The first is the location. It can't be entirely helped since it's part of the convention center complex, but it's a decent distance from the downtown and tourist sites. It's a walkable distance, but plan on a brisk 30 minute walk before you start to get to areas that are interesting. The second drawback is that apparently the walls are thin. Noises in the hallway seem magnified and you can even hear the squeak of doorhandles turning in the hallway.

They have great amenities and a HUGE lounge with a little shop for coffee, snacks, reading materials...ect. The valet and bell hop guys are very nice...plenty of room to handle many cars. The cab line downstairs at the peak of ""going out"" time was sort of long but it moved quickly.

6/25/2007;x5nmwaiAWBXu2miF8a4fug;_pIG1_s6Bzymn1zeyLjBHQ;"4.5 stars..... We stayed in a suite at this hotel, and it was one helluva room.  I loved it.  Views cover 2 of the 4 walls in the suites, and the bed feels like a cloud dropped out of heaven.  What more can you ask for? However - - it loses the 1/2 star solely because it's out in the middle of nowhere.  Unless you have reason to be near the Convention Center, which is conveniently located right next to the hotel (attached, actually) then there really is no reason to be at Hyatt McCormick.  (This is the reason we were at this location to begin with, obviously.) To get to ""downtown"" or the more happening areas of Chicago, it will generally be a $10+ cabride there, and then again, on the way back.  After a week there, this can accumulate to quite a sum.    The only plus side to this is that you get to drive up and down Michigan Ave during all times of the day/night, and see what's happening.  This would be nice if you rented a car... but then driving home after a night out will STILL be quite a hike! Many things about the Hyatt McCormick indicate it IS indeed a hotel all about business, and even the staff seem accustomed to dealing with people traveling for business - not pleasure, in that they are rather curt, get the job done, and no small talk, no extra smile, or anything.  Their goal is to get people in, and out as efficiently as possible.  No complaints, but you can tell you're not in California anymore.  :-) Bathrooms were nice - shower was great.  Toiletries - very nice.   There is a general lack of outlets in the room. Television, for the size of the room, was small, but there were two tv's in our suite. There is also a bar area with fridge and cabinets with sink - - no stove though - and no microwave, so it's more for entertaining than preparing food or reheating food. Really beautiful room and breathtaking view.  I wish I had taken photos, but unfortunately, I forgot! If this hotel were located centrally within ""playing distance"", I'd give it a 5-star hands down, but solely for its location -  I can't give it the full 5-stars.  4.5 stars it is.";4;1;2;1;N;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
9/22/2009;NNlbZ9xAZmDt4j1-h0D2lQ;TvRqHTHzTRLry_4u2nafAA;"The Hyatt at McCormick Place was the second hotel that I stayed at during my recent visit to Chicago.  I was unsatisfied with my previous location and was in a rush to check into the Hyatt.  Although the regular check in time is at 3pm, I explained my situation to a front desk girl at 8am and she quickly found a great room for me.  I settled into my room shortly thereafter.   The corner room that I was given had all of the regular Hyatt Regency features like the cushy bed, pillows, textured wall treatments, stone bathroom floors, etc.  These features were on par with the  two previous stays that I've had across the country this past summer with HR so I can say that HR is of consistently decent quality.  The main difference that I found at this Hyatt was that there was no concierge present during the whole duration of my visit.  Rather, the guest services helped us out and were our de facto concierges.  Our concierges were helpful with recommendations because there are no nearby eateries unless you count the Connie's Pizza and McDonalds located deep in the belly of the McCormick Center.   Taking a cab is essential to get a good impression of the city no matter what hotel you use.  Although the HR has a free one way shuttle (leaves on the top of each hour), it only makes three stops: the museum campus, water tower and Navy pier.  All of these stops are great taxi pickup spots, you can get closer to your intended destinations. Thankfully I ended my stay in Chicago with the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place.  I've learned that I can depend on them for great amenities and customer service.  I'll look forward to staying at another one in the future.";4;1;1;0;N;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

Ok, to be fair, they shuttle you into downtown, but ha!  guess what?  NO shuttle back!  [sucka!]   Negatives: The room was average, we had a two bed room.  I didn't like that the bathroom was open, (ie: no door to the sink area) b/c then that means if you get up earlier or in the middle of the night, the other person can hear you.   The deco was ok, very modern feel, but lacked since there wasn't a microwave.   Positives: Did like that the shower was separate, had decent toiletries.  The floors were updated with granite, but average counter tops.

There isn't much around it to do though, so if you're looking for more to do in the evening than stay in and watch TV, you should try for something further north.  It is close to Chinatown, though you should drive there or take a cab.  There's a patch of a bad neighborhood between McCormick Place and there, so walking is not a good choice. But the room was nice (mine had a little bonus living room area), room service was excellent (better than a Westin I stayed at a few days later), and everyone there was welcoming and friendly.  There's an attached parking garage, with valet available, and you can easily get to downtown or down to 55 from there.";4;0;1;0;N;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

The staff is always friendly and I often get upgraded to nicer rooms. The location is prime because I hop on the public bus (stop is right in front of the hotel) and I am downtown in 10-15 minutes for a few bucks without having to pay for a cab. I have stayed here to attend a conference and it was well orchestrated with ample meeting space for the events. During non-conference trips I have enjoyed their great gym and sauna (seriously, quite nice) for some healthy relaxation. The gym is not huge but it is well equipped with everything you need (all top of the line). I haven't checked out the pool yet, but it seems serviceable. Some have complained about non-comfy beds, but mine have always been great. Once or twice I was stuck on a lower floor on the ""bad"" side of the tower, but usually I get a room with sweeping views of downtown Chicago or the lake. Regarding cleanliness -- I have yet to have a single bedbug scare and I have been staying here on and off for two years now. Most rooms are well kept, occasionally you get stuck in one with some old or uncared furniture but usually not. Soundproofing sometimes leaves a bit to be desired and depending on where you are you can hear hallway noise or noise from adjacent rooms, but it usually is nothing overwhelming and typical of what you would find at any hotel. Price-wise, I often get a good deal staying here (usually around $120-145 a night) which I think is great for a place with so many amenities and good service. Room service can be hit or miss, but I do make sure to always order breakfast as it's consistently delicious. You have to pay for internet which sucks but it's not too pricey. Once when I was there, I had a work emergency and needed to print and fax asap. I used their facilities on sight and got everything I needed in a timely way -- the downside was it was pricey -- I think it cost me $50+ to print maybe 10 pages and fax 10 pages. Staff is always courteous and attentive.

What Hyatt Did Right: - Offered to comp the Red Roof Inn room - Gave me $120 in cash for the cab ride - Offered me a guaranteed room the next night at a reduced rate plus all meals comped. - Upgraded my room to a corner suite - Sent me ""I am Sorry"" snacks and form letter like notes of apology from the G.M. and  catering manager. What Hyatt Did Wrong: - Sent me 1 1/2 hours out of my way to stay an an AWFUL hotel. - Gave me $10 too little to cover the cab fare back and forth - BILLED ME IN FULL FOR THE UPGRADE ROOM and FOR THE SNACKS!!!!! I was stupefied by offering all these nice things and then sending me the bill.  Really?!  Do you treat all guests this way???  I guess as a convention site they really don't have to provide quality customer service - they get people regardless.  When I travel, I generally like to stay at nicer hotels - Hyatt has recently been crossed off my list.

If you're going for a convention at McCormick Place, or just passing through town, this is a fantastic hotel.  If you're a tourist, I wouldn't choose to stay here.  If you're a tourist going through a deal site and are blindly placed here, just be prepared to drive or spend a little of that saved money on cabs.

This is a pretty nice hotel--I wouldn't rave and brag about it being 4-star because when I laid my head down to sleep every night, I still felt like I was sleeping in a 3 (or maaaybe 3.5)-star hotel room. My boyfriend and I won 2 nights here through Priceline for a holiday, so we understood that we really weren't in any position to complain about much. However, there were a couple of things that we THOUGHT would be expected, considering that we were still at a supposedly fancy place. 1. The walls are INCREDIBLY thin. If you stayed in that hotel with us that weekend, we could tell you everything that you did. We knew when you went to the bathroom. We knew when you showered. We knew when you fought and cussed out your drunk girlfriend in your hotel room THREE doors down for 2 hours. And we knew that your devilish 5-year-old did NOT want to take a bath, go eat breakfast, or do anything else that you politely asked them to do. Thank GOD nobody around us got laid that weekend (although they probably didn't feel the same way lol) Minus half a star for you! 2. I appreciate the plethora of parking...especially since the hotel is in a major city. But when that doorman told us that daily parking was $33 and valet was $45, we almost had a heart attack. lol Guess that's how yall roll at these fancy schmancy hotels! We didn't complain or anything, but thirty dollars?! lol I guess that's more of a heads up for everyone.  No stars lost, but you get a warning. 3. O.M.G. You'd think that some of the money they're milking out of everyone would go towards the beds, considering that that's really what you're paying for. I know hotels aren't really using real boxsprings anymore, but the things that these mattresses were resting on were horrible! They made noises every time you sat on them.  And the mattresses were just outright uncomfortable. They were cheap, wherever they got them from. We actually spent the next 2 nights at a run-of-the-mill Marriott in Detroit, and their beds--amazing! Felt like I was in a 4-star bed...kinda how I THOUGHT I was going to feel when I slept here. This alone made me want to never stay at this hotel again. Yes, I understand you pay for the name when you stay at these kind of hotels, but I mean, a bed is a STANDARD luxury. If you're going to act like you're a luxury hotel, get a luxury bed! Or at least one that you can sleep in (not ON, in!) Great big fail on this front, guys. Minus one star. 4. I had a sink that took forever to process. lol It kind of annoyed me! You'd think this could be easily fixed with some Drain-o--why don't the housekeepers make note of this kind of stuff, anyway? Not a big deal, but it urked me. Good thing we had two sinks to work from. No points lost here. 5. All in all, it's a beautiful hotel. The decor inside is amazing, and the restaurants looked lovely (we chose to eat inside the city instead of splurging on hotel food). And you'd think with it being as tall as it is, the views would be better, but from our room, it really wasn't much. Maybe it's better from some of the other rooms. Doesn't help that it's not in the best part of Chicago--don't worry, you're not in the hood by any means, but you're definitely not in the thriving bustle of the city. I'll give half a star for trying, I guess. So there you have it! Four star on paper, three star in reality. Will I stay there again? Not if I have a choice! Would I recommend staying there? Only if you have to, or if you're like us, and happened to win it somehow. No need to run from it, but there's no need to run and tell your friends either. lol";3;0;0;0;N;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

7/15/2010;DYxl;BGYu40jTU6oRS7AZv-c4KA;"Chose this hotel for price/location. This is a older city hotel- rooms are smaller than you might be accustomed to. That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the ""El"" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems. I would stay here again because of the location/price, and I would recommend it, but, those pillows... oh my gosh... Please fix those pillows!";3;1;0;0;N;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk. Not to mention it was rather weird to have some homeless guy saluting buses as they passed on the street and harassing pedestrians as they walked down the street and then dancing in front of the window as me and my boyfriend ate breakfast.

11/10/2011;mI1bA6HEnc1PxlG3NF-TuA;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;"Service.  It is truly what sets apart the Ritz chain of hotels from other hotels. You see it in the smallest ways.  The front desk clerk coming from behind the counter to personally hand you your key.  The doorman who runs back to your valet parked car to grab a bag you forgot and then brings it to the meeting room you are in.  The staff cleaning the public restrooms who greets you when you enter and says good bye when you leave. All small gestures . . . .but gestures that don't go unnoticed. The rooms are not as opulent as they might have once seemed as other chains have picked up their game but they are nice.  Oh sure, the rooms are over sized, and have a bed with the best  pillows, linens and duvets but they don't feel ""over the top"" as I used to think Ritz hotels were. The bathrooms are adorned with marble and feature L'Occitane products which are always appreciated.  And the deep tub is always welcome in a world of hotel rooms that is quickly becoming a ""shower nation"". Internet is free and there is a small mini bar in the room.  What was missing for me, though, was coffee in the room.  I know I could call and have a pot delivered to me, but i just wanted to slurp down a cup without all the hassle of getting dressed, etc. Many of the meeting rooms have terrific views of the lake and of the city.  Even the staff that work the private banquet functions are super friendly and nice, helping to do whatever you need even before you know that you need it. So I'll end as I began.  At the Ritz, it's all about the service.  And while that model has been copied by many of the high end resorts that I have the privilege to visit, it is still evident in everything that they do here.  And that is much appreciated by this ""road weary"" traveler!";4;4;3;1;N;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

Last time when there was an afternoon tea we were in the section underneath/surround by all the windows with city views.  This time, we were told our reservation for tea was in their itty bitty, open and uncharismatic restaurant.  Points lost for change of scene and seeing the city.  Then, there was no harpist or carolers or anything that represented this quaint holiday tradition.  Instead it just sounded like we were in a field house.   All that aside, the service was terrible.  Especially considering it's the Ritz...I would think they'd have people kissing your ass left and right.  We were 10 mins early for our 4pm reservation, and yet weren't sat until 4:20.  This is only after we witnessed the entire 'lobby' (by the fountain) clear out and everyone else sat that had come after us....I actually went up to the host and pointed this out to which he brought us to a table that wasn't set.   The wait staff was horrific throughout the entire experience.  We spoke to about 4 different servers, each bringing something different.  Our original server that took our order, never came back to get our wine order.  We had to flag him down.  No one ever came by to check in on us, or worse, refill our wine glasses.  We grabbed a bus boy to do so.  Then when the check came, it sat for 20 minutes and when still no one had come by to pick it up, we had to flag down yet another waiter to run the card.

3/2/2012;4zQT;2btMPwEpuFtaXLhQg3s_sg;"We had a lovely experience at the Ritz-Carlton Chicago. LOCATION:  Very conveniently located to major attractions, Michigan Ave, & Rush St. STAFF:  Haven't encountered one sour puss. Everyone from door man to front desk & concierege to housekeeping has been perfectly pleasant and acccomodating. QUIRKS:  You take one set of elevators from street level to the lobby (12th floor). You take a different set of elevators from the lobby (12th floor) up to the guest rooms. And a third elevator takes you from the lobby down to the next level (11th floor) where the pool, exercise room and spa are located. The pool is one of the only amenities that appears in need of a renovation. It seems dark, uninviting and a throw-back to hotel pools of yesteryear. After a day of sightseeing and shopping, we mistakenly thought we'd chill poolside, take a dip, enjoy a beverage (avec tiny paper umbrella) and read a book. To our dismay, the room was dark and cavelike, the seating was sparse, and the pool was roped off into 4 lanes making it more of a lap pool than a place to unwind. And, there was no tiki bar. ROOM:  Quite comfortable. Large window across far end of room looks out over city. Comfortable couch. Spacious dresser with in-room safe and plenty of drawer space. Comfortable bed, soft linens. Two night stands. Stylish furnishing - not too edgy and not too ""starving artists sale out at the airport."" Nice sized flat screen TV on swivel stand on dresser. Large desk with office chair. Plenty of lighting and lamps. Nice sized closet with plenty of hangers. Separate bar/fridge area. BATH:  Spacious. Double sinks/vanities. Separate room with toilet and shower. 2 robes and 2 slippers provided for use during stay. Towels soft but still confident in structure and oversized. L'OCCITANE products including: 3 bar soaps, hand lotion, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner. Small canister on vanity with cotton balls, cotton pads and Q-tips).  Bath mats in front of toilet/shower and in front of sinks. Hair dryer. OTHER:   A little bar appears in the morning near the front desk area in the lobby with coffee, tea, espresso and a small assortment of pastries. It's adjacent to the hotel's business center, where I sit at this moment, composing this review. It's open 24 hours/day and offers a Mac and two PCs for guests' use. A fine place to slip away should one of you be an early bird and want to allow your other to sleep, hypothetically.";4;1;0;0;N;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
6/21/2011;GMmFZTMHQd474fAvKLEHjQ;RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ;"It would be a sin to give this Ritz anything but five stars. Everything is flawless there. It's almost too flawless. From the valet's perfectly tailored clothing to the decor with not a smidgen of dirt to be found anywhere, this Ritz puts on the Ritz in their own hotel. I must admit, I felt a little grungy when I was a guest here at the Ritz and I'm far from a grungy person. But even wearing sundresses and pants with nice tops didn't seem to be quite elegant enough for the Ritz. Had I known, I would have packed my pearls and worn tailored dresses the whole time. That's what everyone else was wearing at least. The men were in suits or should I say, ""casual suits"" during the day and the women were in the same. We were about 30 years younger than any other guest at the Ritz so maybe that's why we got so many looks. But attitudes and guest attire aside, this hotel is spectacular. The lobby is on the 12th floor of the Water Tower so don't let the street entrance fool you. That's just a precursor to the glory. You exit the first group of elevators and enter a majestic setting of floor to ceiling windows and a huge lobby, lounge and restaurant overlooking the city of Chicago with the first view being of the Hancock building. Plus, don't forget about the Roman-like fountain placed perfectly in the center of the lobby. The rooms are just as magical as the lobby. Everything is clean. Everything is quiet. I didn't hear one peep from one guest or staffer my entire stay. It's like you enter into your own little royal world when you stay in a room at the Ritz. Some highlights include: - The beds. Oh heaven...the beds. I could have slept my way through vacation but the city of Chicago deserves more from me. - The bath products. They provide L'Occitane products in the bathrooms. Splendid. - The service. Completely perfect and professional from the minute of check-in to check out and this includes the run in with the maids and the valet giving me an umbrella when it started to rain. Some tips: If you are looking for five star service, in a five star setting, in the heart of Chicago, you can't do much better than the Ritz. Be sure to find time to sit in the lounge/bar area overlooking the city for a drink and if you are there on Sunday and have the time and funds, enjoy the Sunday brunch. I didn't eat it, but the smells and appearance told me it's worth every penny! So goodbye Ritz, until hopefully one day when I can visit again. I promise next time, I'll remember to pack my pearls!";5;7;7;4;N;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

She went everywhere we went, and they could not have been more accommodating. Some interesting sidebars: as the Ritz is right off Michigan Ave, even though you're in tourist central there's loads of shopping nearby if that's your thing, and some great restaurant options as well. I especially liked the idea that they'll rent an iPad 2 to you for twenty bucks a day if you want some high tech help seeing the city, and were it not for the fact that my face is usually affected by the pallor of my computer screen all too often, I'd have rented one, too. The lounge is spacious, opens up to the panoramic windows besides, and the service was prompt without looming.

I dreamed of this place the moment my parents made me go back to the crappy quiet IL area I was from - all right it was a nice town but just not my bag, baby, as Austin Powers might say - and from this point on, I knew that while my parents chose a different life, I was going to become a working child at 12 so I would never again have to leave my favorite Midwestern metropolis. I certainly made that true when I began working in journalism and running around Springfield and Chicaboomboomwow town at 14 for work. Was it all due to this experience?

My room was updated and a lake view room which I liked but it was somewhat smaller than my room at the Four Seasons in Chicago.

6/7/2010;MOBgRHH8mgehHh-UghkMdw;vwEBPjdmPF2JPNvrFQu0VQ;"Good: - Nice room with an good (but heavily blocked) view of the lakefront. - Chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for me in the room. - Shower was nice in that it was easy to use and didn't leak. - Comforter/blanket was just right on the warmth scale - The furniture was generally very comfortable and upscale. - Nice and plentiful pillows with soft fabric. - Clean-up staff did a great job. - Staff did a great job pointing me where to go. Bad: - Those strawberries I mentioned came with a card from a husband written to his wife.  I'm a guy, and not this husbands wife!  It was a mistake made by the hotel staff and completely unacceptable. - The elevators... there needs to be WAY more of them.  I swear I waited over 10 min. twice for an elevator.  Also, you have to go through two elevators just to get to the hotel floor you're staying on.  That's really annoying, especially since they take forever to arrive and aren't very quick to ascend/descend the floors.  Plus the elevators looked old and shabby with tacky gold stuff everywhere. - The bed was so soft, I literally awoke sunk over an inch into the matress.  I think the matress was covered with that foam stuff.  Whatever it was, it was way too soft! - The hotel staff evidently went into my room at least once a day for no real reason.  The room would have the same mess I left, but the TV would be turned and left on, playing classical music.  I don't want to walk into my room to see an energy-sucking TV playing classical music with a black screen noting only the channel number via crappy TV speakers.  That was absolutely ridiculous.  If they want to freak me out by turning music on when I didn't leave it on, they can go ahead and use the little clock stereo they include in the room!!! - Parking was ridiculously expensive and I had to use valet to park.  I don't like it when people drive my car.  It's not your regular car and it's a stick shift.  No reason for me to have to have someone else park my car... no reason at all. - Here's the kicker... a week later I needed a copy of my receipt because I lost the original.  I called and was directed to accounting.  I was asked to hold.  Then I was told I had to fax in a written request.  Excuse me?  (1) This is 2010... get an online site where I can just download a PDF of my receipt like you can do with even Motel 6 and (2) No other hotel I've ever encountered requires a written request!

The mini bar was stocked with the good stuff, including Bombay Sapphire (my personal fave). Classy bar, classy mirrored elevator.... smallish reception desk. I think people need to give the hotel a break.... it was built before swimming pools were common. My one prob with the hotel room was the bathroom. It did not have a tub, but a walk-in glass walled shower. So there was no way to have a bubble bath, first off. Secondly, the glass sCrEeched! When the door was closed, as it was glass-on-glass. Needless to say, since there was no seal, water leaked onto the bathroom floor. The other problem was the rain shower. You could only turn on the water and adjust the temperature while standing next to the hand held spigot ... right under the rain showerhead!! So.... you are forced to endure a few seconds of cold water from the shower head (even my attempts to squeeze into a corner of the shower stall did not spare me) as you switch from the handheld to the shower head. BAD design... I also had gotten the Groupon for $89 and spent Valentine's evening here, and I admit I might be giving it three stars if I'd paid full retail price.

I booked my stay here while a 20% off special was running, it came to about $150/night for the middle of the week. While that is a good rate I believe for a hotel in the area, what you realize when you get there is that a lot of the incidental, parking etc. are pretty outrageous. Valet parking was $55/night. I needed a roll on bed added to my room, in most hotels I've stayed in this has been for free but they charged $20/night for this too. In many ways this hotel is the bastard cousin of the Drake, right across the street. Don't expect it to be quite as glamorous or classy, but ofcourse you get what you pay for. Also the location is smack in the middle of the ""Vi-tri"" (Viagra triangle) in Chicago. Basically a lot of old dudes hanging out at the steakhouses and bars in the area.

6/22/2012;SRAbAwQGV6m8TE3;UVP0n_HSEcyHUyltfl_v0w;"Our suite at the Knickerbocker is quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. First, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present.  Not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""What do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. Fast forward to this evening.  Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume.  On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property.  This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again?  Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill.  Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.";1;1;0;0;N;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

Super quiet sleeping, very nice linens, huge TV, stocked mini-fridge.  I felt their customer service was fantastic.  Front desk was professional and very quick, and the doorman was kind enough the brush the snow of my dirty filthy car while we retrieved our bags.   One problem:  for late night snacks, there's not much around.

There are a few interesting things about this hotel - it used to be the Playboy Hotel when Playboy was headquartered in Chicago.  If you're into quirky historical places, yay.  It's also within walking distance of Carmines - another quirky historical place.  Frank Sinatra and Al Capone were regulars.  See my review of Carmine's for more info. The hotel itself is a small boutique joint.  The rooms are very small, but clean and the beds are comfortable.  The bathrooms are modern, and have rain showers as well as hand shower wands.  My room did not have a bath tub. As far as food choices at the Knickerbocker go, plan to eat elsewhere.  There is a martini bar in the lobby, but don't ask for a cucumber martini.  You'll get a blank stare.  There is a restaurant - Nix - but don't plan on dinner.  They are only open in the mornings.  Don't even plan on a late lunch there.  They close at 1.   Internet is not complimentary ($9.95/day), and there is a minimum $5 charge to use the business center.  I was also informed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that there was a charge for gym use.  Parking is valet only, and is $53/day (gulp).  There is no pool. If all you need is a comfortable bed, on a quiet street close to Miracle Mile, and you either don't need extras or don't mind paying for them,  this is a great choice for you.";3;8;4;0;N;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

Throughout the planning process, they were very willing to work with us to keep the event within our budget. They also ensured that everything ran smoothly on the day of the event, from allowing our committee to show up early to do some setting up, to being ready to go with both the coat check and the bar.

The bar isn't really separated from the lobby, it almost feels like one space.  Martinis were on par for the neighborhood ($14) and the bar had a live trio playing one evening. Parking was $44/day, almost 1/2 the room rate - ouch!  (Why do this when you have your lovely daughter who can serve as a shuttle driver between her apartment and your hotel?!)  Room rates were reasonable ($105) by calling the hotel directly, but I'm betting you could get lower by using a service like Priceline.";4;1;0;0;N;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

Pros:  great location, close to everything.  A historical landmark, and right across the street from from the Drake Hotel, an even more historical Chicago landmark.  Room size is average for a downtown hotel, which means ""not very big"" - but the bed was comfortable and bathroom was nicely decorated with modern fixtures. Cons:  in the hotel's attempt to be eco-friendly, they installed modern, low-water-consumption toilets that aren't powerful enough to flush anything down but liquids - I had to call an engineer to plunge the toilet when we checked in.  Also, there was some evidence of yellowish-brown crud in the corners of the bathroom (gross).  The shower was another issue - they installed a nice ceiling mounted shower head as well as a handheld nozzle, but the shower itself (no bathtub) is very small and the glass door opens INWARD, so when you turn on the shower you either get shocked by cold water coming down from the ceiling, or you drench the door and bathroom floor if you choose to turn the shower on first and let it warm up.  Not a very smart layout. Additionally, if you have a car, valet parking is mandatory at $53/day (there's no self-parking) but that's downtown parking for you.  On the plus side, the valets are very friendly and pleasant, and are very prompt with retrieving your car when you call down for it.";3;2;0;1;N;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

The space was set up bright and early every morning for our meetings. The food for the meetings was pretty decent. You know how hotel meeting food can be. They put on quite the spread for our lunch service and we were quite pleased. The banquet and meetings staff were extremely helpful and even loaded up our A/V equipment and other valuables to be locked up with security so we didn't have to lug it back to our rooms. They took care of it all for us without a hitch! The Hotel: Omni is a very nice hotel. It's in a great location for a meeting or a weekend away. It's a little confusing though as the lobby is on the third floor and you have to take different elevators to get to the lobby or meeting spaces vs. the elevators for the rooms.

However.  Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel.  Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program.  If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine.  However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect.  I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to ""keep trying.""  I usually had to ""keep trying"" until the next day.  To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush.  I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, ""leftovers,"" no matter what I was flushing.  As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe.

The hotel was right in the middle of everything and it was nice to be able to just walk around the city and explore. The hotel was really nice and the people were friendly - especially the guys up front! One of them even chased down a van to accommodate our large group when we were planning a night out on the town. I'd have to say one of the major advantages of this place is the location - you don't really have to go far to dine or shop, and even if you felt like taking a ten minute walk you could go right down to millennium park, the museum of contemporary art, or you could even take the red line which is 5 blocks away if you feel like venturing out farther.

Sooo annoying. And there was no off switch on the damn thing. I had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). I kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. The shower was ONLY incredibly hot. Turn it all the way cold...very hot. Turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. Grrrrreat. So how do I get water that won't scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. Good job Omni! 3. Hallway carpets are disgusting and old. Walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6.

All in all, we'd likely stay there again if we couldn't find comparable within 2 blocks or so just because of the location but improving some of those things would be a surefire way to get our repeat business. Before you go, sign up for their free Omni Select Guest program and you'll get free wifi in your room instead of a $10 daily charge.  You'll also get 2 complimentary beverages per person for up to 2 people in the morning.  We got real used to hot cocoa and OJ for breakfast.  They were always right on time.  They also give you these weird little shots of some kind of smoothie that my hubby loved but I thought smelled like clay so I wasn't touchin' that stuff!  So the free program was MORE than worth it!  We also got the parking included package which I think runs between $179-$229 at the time of reviewing depending on the time of year you book.  (We paid the high end because we were there at Christmas)  It was really nice to not have to worry about self parking and we only used the car one time while there and all was well with the car.  No extra miles put on the car ala Ferris Bueller!";4;1;1;0;N;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

This hotel is definitely more bang for your buck than most of the hotels in the area that I was also researching. To tip the scales even more in the right direction of price, we booked our stay with a ""Chi-Town City Escape Package"" that the hotel was promoting (now until 9/5/11) and they give... yes give you a $50 gift card + $20 food voucher per day. SCORE!!! Upon check-in, we were handed the gift card.

I have driven, and walked by Hotel 71 countless times- and somehow I always got the impression that it was an outdated hotel in a great location. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. I had a Groupon to stay at Hotel 71 for less than $100 a night. Quite the feat for this part of town. Given that the rate was so low- I chose to upgrade to one of their King River View Rooms for a few more dollars. An excellent choice as my room was on the 12th floor- and looked right down the Chicago River, and all its bridges- a beautiful view day or night. When I arrived at the hotel- the valet took my car ( a little pricey at $43 but in line with other places in the area) and I walked up to the front desk. The front desk clerk was welcoming and pleasant and had no issue in dealing with my Groupon or the special request that I had of him. You see- I was staying in town to go to a concert and I had a couple of tickets I was leaving for friends at the front desk. Given the value of the tickets and the fact that the concert was that night- there was little margin for error. He said it wouldn't be a problem, they do it all the time and he was right. My friends picked up the tickets with no problem. Nice. My room was large with a plush king sized bed with tons of pillows. The bathroom was also large and came with only a shower- no tub. The amenities were similar to a mid range hotel- nice but not luxurious. The towels functional but not sumptuous. The toiletries fine but not high end. But all in all a good deal for the money all the way around. If you want something to eat there is a cafe on the ground floor and of course room service. All it seemed to be lacking to me was a bar area where I could have had a drink while waiting on a friend of mine. But since the weather was so fine- I wandered across the river and had a few outside at Smith and Wollensky instead. Check out was seamless.

8/27/2007;CjiGxBPkKUREBomUtr18dw;FyiYuZrIzSkgshdazHZCWw;"Is it wrong to give a hotel 2 stars based mostly on the elevators? I just can't justify 3, although to be fair I guess this should be more like a 2.5, because the room my parents stayed in was nice and pretty big, with a great view. But honestly, with the amount of money they have got to be making, they REALLY need to invest some time and energy into renovating their elevators. First of all, if you can get on an elevator in under five minutes from the time you push the button, congratulations to you! The elevator never, ever, ever came quickly, whether we had called it from the ground floor or the floor my parents were staying on. Even though they have the floors separated into sections, and a couple elevators per section, it doesn't help. One time my mom walked all the way to the end of the hall back to their room, let herself in, and got something she had forgotten -- and this was AFTER we'd already waited 2 or 3 minutes for the elevator -- and when she got back we STILL had another 1 or 2 minutes before the elevator arrived. Second of all, the elevator is S-L-O-W SLOW. I guess this goes without saying, considering how long it takes to arrive at whatever floor you're on, but oh my goodness, it's even more painfully slow than you'd imagine it would be while you're waiting for it. Pretty much every time we rode the elevator DOWN, it stopped at every single floor, and it quickly filled up (because, oh, did I mention the elevators are also pretty small? Cuz they are.) and so the first few people would be able to get on, but by the 3rd stop or so, we'd just be met with exasperated faces and rolling eyes every time the door opened and whoever was waiting for the elevator realized they'd have to wait for yet ANOTHER ten minutes for the next elevator and hope that it wasn't full. Honestly, I can't imagine staying on the mid-range floors, how did they ever get downstairs?! It honestly would have been faster to walk. And the whole experience wasn't MUCH more pleasant for those of us ON the elevator, either, considering how much longer it took to get downstairs. And, last but not least, the elevators are pretty terrifying. I don't know how old they are but I'm going to guess PRETTY DAMN OLD. Other than that, the hotel was pretty good.";2;4;0;2;N;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

4/5/2007;VVZCy;Hj8XSXWjcvuz7dE7udjnvg;"There are some renovations going on right now, so I'd say the experience could be hit or miss.  My recent 5 night stay was a pleasant one overall, but I can definitely see how it can potentially be much better... On the positive side: *  great location - walk to the corner, make a left, cross the canal, and you're in the heart of Michigan avenue with upscale shops and restaurants.  Also close to the El and walking distance to theaters, etc. * nice view (if you're on the right side of the building) - I had a corner unit so I could see the Marina Towers, the Tribune building, the Trump tower (under construction), and up Wacker Drive along the river.  Plus, there was plenty of light so the room felt a little bigger than it was. * good service - got some extra pillows, a loaner umbrella, and a tv fix * surprisingly decent exercise facility and business center - clean, modern equipment with good views.  Both were completely empty all 3 nights I used them. * room amenities - comfortable bed, handy chaise, and Bath+Body Works soap/shampoo/lotion (more of a plus for my wife, but I can appreciate the nice touch too) On the negative side: * room was a bit small and cramped * tv was ancient and didn't work properly * doors slam loudly (I woke up several times at night when neighbors were in and out) * elevators don't give you good feelings * towels were not the cleanest (I'm a little picky on this subject, but consistently found towels that had traces of stains or looked really worn - you can always ask for more) So overall, not bad - I got a great deal on my stay - otherwise I might have given it 3 stars.  Should be better once the renovations are complete.  I'd recommend checking it out after that's done, unless you can get a really good rate.";4;2;1;0;N;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
1/8/2010;o-Tl6stpiVsly6bRmR;x_RnrZm7bfS4U31Bz_1jIA;"I stayed in Hotel71 for two weeks over the holidays, and it turned out to be a pretty nice place. My boyfriend and I booked the queen double room with a city view. We chose the double room because it was considerably larger than the single bed rooms and was almost the same price on http://hotels.com. Our room came with two beds, a desk area, a chaise lounge, and a two-part bathroom (one room held the marbled sinks and mirrors, while the adjoining room had the rain shower and bathtub). Our room had plenty of storage space, a huge closet, and plenty of cabinets and drawers to store our belongings. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We requested a mini fridge and microwave, which were both placed in our room by the time we checked in. The gym in the hotel is very nice with a ton of different machines. The gym also has an amazing view of the city, definitely a bonus while working out. My only complaints have to do with the cable and phone service in the hotel. The cable had a VERY limited amount of channels, about 20. If you're visiting the city for the first time, this won't be a problem since I assume you'll want to go out and about in Chicago and not sit in the hotel and watch tv., but since I am native to the city and stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks, I definitely had down time in the hotel. The no tv. situation was a big letdown for me. Lastly, the biggest problem we experienced was the phone service. The area code for downtown Chicago is 312, while the rest of Chicago is 773. We made a few phone calls to 773 numbers, believing that they would be considered ""local"" and thus be free. This is not the case, upon check out we were handed a bill for over $80 in phone charges. We checked everywhere in the room and welcome book, NOWHERE does it say anything about exorbitant charges for phone service. We called the front desk and explained that they should have posted somewhere about the fees and that we felt misled. They gave us a $40 credit and apologized, blamed the fees on some new phone provider that they are switching to. The credit was ok, but I definitely still feel taken advantage of. My advice if you stay at Hotel71, get a bigger room, it's worth it, and DO NOT touch the phone unless you want a huge bill waiting for you at check out.";4;2;1;0;N;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

The rooms are a very generous size, but the bathroom was awful.  The water wasn't hot enough for my shower, and I feel that as a 5'3"" woman, I should *not* be able to look out over the top of the shower curtain.

Anyways, as far as the actual hotel goes, it was better than average but not great.  It felt like a hotel that tried to be modern and hip but wasn't quite there yet.  Service was excellent with nothing to complain about.  Two elevators were available for my floor (they separate it into two halves, each with two elevators) and I never had to wait long.  Most of the time the elevator is already at the bottom waiting for you. Room was nice.  King sized bed was cozy and sheets were adequate.  I love the wireless connection in the room and used my laptop from the bed often.  I wish the TV was upgraded to a flat screen.  I used their business service center to print out my boarding pass the day before my flight and it was easy to do. The biggest downside of this hotel which is enough to dock off 2 stars for me is the bathroom.  First of all, I didn't like how the closet was located in there.  Second, no counter top?!?  All they had was a skinny ledge below the mirror which is barely enough to hold things.  The shower curtains were crimpled and the toilet was horrendous (weak flush and it kept making a pumping noise for a few seconds after you flush).  Tiles were old school and nothing to write home about. Besides the bathroom, everything else was good.  The biggest plus for this hotel is the location.  I found it very convenient to the Magnificent Mile (just a 5 minute walk) as well as the Metro stations.

The views of the river were spectacular, and the interior was extremely well appointed, with the exception of a small couch which didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the plush decorations. A few knocks were a gigantic walk in closet which really would serve no purpose unless and extremely compulsive packer stayed here.

The elevator itself took away alot of our motivation out that weekend when deciding where and when we were going anywhere.

Make sure to ask the hotel staff about Windella river cruises, which are a stones throw away from the location. Equally, the decor of the hotel is fabulous, with an ultra-modern lobby, full of trendy pictures and lighting.  Chances are, you won't even need a cab to get around because Hotel 71 is so close to everything.

I thought that it was a dead animal.   Walking down the hallway, it struck me that the dead animal smell was actually some of the most pungent marijuana that I've ever experienced (and I've experienced A LOT of marijuana!).  After catching the hallway buzz, I relaxed in the room and was quickly delivered my cocktails, though without the mixer- full glasses of straight Absolut.  The full effect of the complimentary weed had now permeated both the hallway and my room.  The entire floor reeked!

It's located right on the river and the Premiere River King suites have breathtaking views, rainforest showers and modern Kuerig coffee makers, a welcome relief from those Hotel coffee makers that sound like someone is violently gargling as if choking to death only to produce a cup of coffee that tastes as if it were strained in a traveling salesmen's soiled sock. I have however deducted stars for two reasons. 1) they no longer serve adequate room service (my first trip they had this wonderful lox served on wafer-thin bagels that I am yet to locate in any health food store) and 2) my last trip they put me in the wrong room and then transferred me to a small Premiere room that was nothing near what I had come to expect for the same price. Repetition is required for excellence in my book. I want to state that I fully intend to try this hotel again and update my score if it improves since my first visit was so memorable for me. I still recommend this place over some if the others I've tried on the river.

Check in was a breeze, staff were friendly and helpful, and made sure I knew about the wine tastings they had available for FREE. That was an awesome extra touch as well. Lobby has trendy oontzy music playing, elevators are quick. Rooms are mod and posh -- though not on the huge side. For one to two people though they are more than fine. There are plenty of extra pillows on a comfy bed (always a bonus for me). Internet access is available for an exorbitant price. Room service, Big tv -- but I didn't use them, and thin as paper walls. I heard my neighbors having a good old time every morning about 6 am and Im sure they heard my late night good times as well. At least we all were enjoying ourselves.

Despite this the people on the phones were always very pleasant. It was just the system seemed to be inadequate. The hotel is actually a pretty cool place.

The hotel staff was exceptional with great recommendations and advice and we enjoyed the adjoining Liquid Lounge.  After walking up Michigan Ave one afternoon I'm so glad we opted to stay here instead of on the Magnificent Mile - navigating the crowds there would have driven me batty!  The neighborhood is relatively quiet, clean, safe and had all the amenities (drugstores, local eateries) we needed.  Clark/Lake blue line is a short walk for airport transport, and we walked to Millennium Park, Magnificent Mile, and Willis Tower from the hotel. Small downside:  no in-room coffee makers but we didn't mind hopping down to the lobby in the mornings to get our fix.

There was a large fireplace and uniquely shaped leather couches. I would describe the decor as ""retro chic."" There were a lot of bold prints mixed with dark woods and interesting art.

It was good! Our bosses actually decided to extend the open bar another half hour because everyone was having such a good time. Another positive about the Allegro is its location.

I had done my research ahead of time to know that not only does the hotel offer a free wine reception every evening (sweet!), but they also have a ""code word"" that you can use to get a special surprise when you check in.  I was expecting a $10 voucher for the restaurant, or something of that scale.  What we actually received was a king suite on the top floor of the hotel.  I think that's the biggest hotel room I've ever been in.  Our jaws dropped as we entered and began to look around.  I crossed the room to the bathroom where I saw that we had a Jacuzzi tub!  I called out to my boyfriend to tell him, only to find out that he was also checking out a bathroom.  For those not keeping up, we had two bathrooms.  Man did I ever feel pampered!   The décor in the room was awesome too.  Definitely nothing like what I would do in my own home, but I loved the funky design of the wallpaper and the blue picture of a cello.  It was so nice that we didn't even mind when I got heat exhaustion and spent the second half of Sunday in the room!  We ordered delivery from Lou Malnati's and relaxed. My only complaint is that the walls were pretty thin, so we could hear the tv in the bordering rooms sometimes, but it didn't really bother us at all.  Also, for at least one day two of the three elevators were out of commission, but they worked on that fairly quickly, and allowed us to use the service elevators in the meantime.  Honestly, everything else was so amazing that I'm going to give it a 5 star rating anyways!

We mentioned it again at check-in and were reassured that all we needed to do was check in with the concierge in the morning. Lo and behold, the concierge gave us one of those looks that the Maitre D' gives Ferris Bueller - raised eyebrow, corners of mouth turned down....Snooty? Snotty! He had no idea. Nothing was booked, and nothing could be on short notice. I love the pet friendly vibe of the Allegro - but we ended up boarding our dog at a nearby place for the night. The pet-sitting service the concierge put us in touch with (Puppy Love) were helpful and accomodating in booking the times we required, but at a price of $360! 2 x 4 hour blocks for $360.

My only real complaint was that when checking in, the front desk person (not Katie) steered us towards breakfast at the attached restaurant (312), and sort of mixed it in with all the complimentary services offered by the hotel (coffee in the morning, wine hour in the late afternoon, etc), so it sort of made it seem like breakfast was complimentary too.

It isn't a bad spot for a romantic getaway, and since it's possible to hear your neighbors (and vice-versa) hilarity can ensue depending on how mischievous you are. Right in Chicago's theater district, you're conveniently near a Metro stop connecting to many lines, including tourist stops and O'Hare International. The location isn't ideal for breakfast as there are too many chain eateries nearby, and the non-chains aren't open early enough. The lobby and lounge is attractive (dig the eclectic wallpaper), and their happy hour special provides free wine - yes, gratis - to guests from 5 to 6 PM, giving one a chance to mingle, or simply unwind solo. (Besides happy hour vino, we scoured small, pricey bottles of Belvedere from our minibar.) After realizing our dinner plans were a bit unrealistic, a concierge stationed in the lobby (Mark) helpfully found us another place, secured a reservation, and provided us with handy directions. Loved our room's decent view, modern decor, and amenities, like dreamy soft beds, an iPod charger/alarm clock (perfect for having an impromptu party like we did), and a huge flat screen TV - the bathroom's glam, marble counter topped with Aveda products was a nice touch too. (Didn't think the room was tiny, but I don't spend quality time in my hotel room.)";4;7;6;6;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
10/6/2009;xpR9XVlt5OwKCkZoQOkmQQ;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;"The Hotel Allegro should have been a five star experience. I mean, what's not to like about a hotel in downtown Chicago, close to everything, especially the theater district, that offers impeccable service in a contemporary environment? Read on, I say. It had been a long day and while I rarely stay in the city since I live here- I was treating my team to a little outing and they wanted to stay in the city so who am I to say no? Due to other commitments, I got to the hotel late and checked in. The lobby is up one level from the street and is decorated in a fun and contemporary way. Know that Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly so I had to maneuver my way around a couple of dogs that had made themselves at home in the front lobby. The desk clerk checked me in quickly and I was in my room moments later. I loved the room layout. I had a corner room with lots of windows, plush pillows on the bed, and a comfy chair. The bed was turned down, the radio on and as I was unpacking my bag I spied two animal print robes in the closet. Rrrrrrrrrrrr! I slipped into one and nibbled a bit on the basket of fruit and cheese that had been sent to the room. Wanting to have a glass of wine to go with it- I went over to the mini bar. It was at this point that I noticed that my mini bar key was broken and no amount of ""finagling"" on my part would open the door. Oh well. I didn't need that wine anyway is what my rational side was saying. My emotional side? Was already whining about no wine! As I settled in for bed- it seemed like a good idea to use the bathroom before I turned in. Imagine my surprise when I flushed and all the water came up instead of going down. Urrgh! Made me think about who the heck was in the room before me? I called down to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer up right away. Oh great. Here I am in my cute leopard print robe. That would never do for a ""visitor"". So I got dressed again to await the man with the steel snake (Trust me. That sounds more interesting than it was!) Other than those two issues and valet parking that was a third of the cost of the room ($48- can you believe that for one night? $42 if you park it yourself) my stay was perfect. Complimentary coffee brought up in the morning, Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, plush towels, chocolates, free wireless, flat screen TV's, everything that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. And the price was right. You can get a negotiated rate of about $150 - $190 per night which is cheap for this part of town. Would I recommend it? You betcha. Only next time I'm going to flush the toilet BEFORE I put the cute leopard print robe on.";4;7;6;5;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
6/9/2008;EiO8OvO1Ts5V2uIp172SqA;qjkOmSEFFEeWVTtsIl0aAw;"Ah, the Allegro.  Filled with pros and cons.  The location is pretty decent (although I do hate that pretty much everything in the Loop is closed on weekends.  Come on, Lavazza, work with me here!!).  The lobby decor is definitely more swank than wank.  Apparently there's free wine in the evenings (which I missed, but turns out the glasses are teeny-tiny, so no big loss, I guess).  But the rooms.  Are SO.  SO.  TINY.  Like, maybe even tinier than the wine glasses.  Granted, we crammed four people into a room with two double beds--certainly fun times, but it was like a clown car.  Four people, four suitcases, two beds in a tiny room and a minuscule bathroom (but with Aveda products, woot) makes for a very cramped weekend.  Once I climbed over everyone and their stuff into bed, though, I very much enjoyed the fluffy pillows and cozy bed linens. We attended a wedding at the Allegro, so I can also comment on their event capacity.  The Walnut Room is a nice space for a smaller ceremony, although very dim (maybe that was just this wedding?  I dunno--none of my photos turned out), and the staff is quick to flip the room for dinner and dancing.  Plenty of room for tables, a stage for the band and a dance floor.  I'm assuming the hotel catered the meal, which was good (although I'd pass on the pasta course or be very clear with the kitchen that the pasta should be al dente).  The servers were very inconspicuous and efficient, although maybe too efficient... I'm pretty sure someone swiped my champagne before I had a chance to drink it and I don't think I was being cut off... My last issue is with the baggage check folks.  My husband was given a framed poster as a groomsmen gift which we couldn't haul on the plane home with us.  We arranged to have a city-dwelling friend pick up the poster from the baggage check and we'd pick it up the next time we drove up to Chicago.  The folks at the Allegro were fine with this arrangement, which was a relief.  After Laura B.'s third attempt to retrieve this framed poster from countless clueless baggage check people, Justin had to call the Manager to make sure they still had the item.  They did and it was finally handed over to our friend, but not after numerous wasted trips on her part.  Boo to the baggage people; five stars for Laura for being a great friend and babysitting the poster for us. :)";3;4;4;4;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

It may behoove some to know that Allegro is one of many fine establishments you can book on Hotwire for half the price.  Not that you can request it, but it's in the pool anyway.";4;4;3;1;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Finding a hotel in Chicago for labor day weekend was easy...finding a decent and convenient four star spot under $120 was somewhat of a challenge until we discovered Hotel Allegro. It's located in the perfect area in Chicago's Downtown Loop/Theater District-a block away from the CTA subway station, walkable to Millennium Park/Grant Park and a quick stroll to the Magnificent Mile. It's a cute hotel with it's own unique charm. The staff was GREAT! They were nice enough to let us check-in early and not leave us stranded....just 8 hours early at 7:00am! And even more helpful at 3:00am when we were in search of some late night grub- deep dish pizza delivered to our hotel room. Although the room/bathroom was only average and could use another renovation, it was fine for the weekend. They made up for it with their daily complimentary wine hour at 5pm, free in-room Wi-Fi, goose down comforters, fitness center (cardio equipment with TVs) and endless Aveda toiletries!";4;5;4;0;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
8/3/2009;GpPV0CwvcdZbB-CbAKCeiQ;oGiqow-Dt9IMepgkswdM4A;"My company booked a block of rooms for all of us because this was within walking distance to the office. When I first got there, the doormen was extremely nice, took my bags and had it sent to the room. I thought it was a little odd that instead of walking in and checking into my room, that I had to take the elevator to the lobby and then I was able to check in. The lobby itself is pretty big, with a grand piano, beautiful staircase, and lots of seats, its actually pretty cozy. The room itself wasn't bad, it was nothing spectacular. The room was big, but the way the room was set up was very odd. Usually the TV is in front of the bed, but mines was way off to the side. The bathroom was tiny! The sink was so small, that you could probably fit like 2 bottles of something and that is all the vanity space you have. Literally if I was on the toilet, I could reach over on the right and wash my hands in the sink or I could take 1 step over to the left and I'd be in the bathtub. Very small bathroom. With all the space in the room, they should really think about making the bathroom just a tad bigger. Bed was a little springy, but it wasn't bad. The comforter was really thin though. Whats with hotels having thin comforters for!? The hotel uses Aveda products so that's a plus. The fitness room was pretty great too - lots of new machines and clean towels. I didn't like that they didn't have a free business center. $6 bux for 15 mins of Internet usage! That's no good considering the other 2 hotels I stayed in Chicago had free 24 hr business center.

I think our Hotwire price was about $120, but the regular price is only in the $190-ish range. 2. You are right down in the loop, which is super convenient. 3. You can bring your pet with you for no additional charge. 4. The staff is *really* friendly, and not in the fake, we're-only-nice-because-you-pay-us way. 5. The lobby is decorated in a very eclectic fashion.  I'm talkin' hot pink and wavy neon blue velour couches-eclectic. 6. Free wine every day from 5-6pm. 7. Adorable, 1940s-meets-Ikea rooms.  They are technically small rooms, yes, but I thought it was very cozy.  I mean, do you really NEED an enormous hotel room?  Shouldn't you be out enjoying the city or something? 8. Aveda shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer.  Free! 9. Free New York Times. 10. Comfy bed with extremely comfy pillows & linens. 11. iPod dock/alarm clock! And the best two things: 12. Not only can you get a variety of standard convenience items for free from the front desk, but you can also get ""fashion tape.""  Fashion tape!  So you can tape up your cleavage!  For free! 13. There is always techno bumping in the elevators.  It's like a crazy, eurotrash party at all hours of the day.  11 a.m., 2 pm., 1:30 a.m.....really.  Who doesn't like to have dance parties in elevators? P.S. Not that I'm defending the soggy nachos that another reviewer had, but I'm not sure why they were charged $28.  The price listed for nachos was $11.  I only noticed this because my fiance had mentioned that someone on Yelp got $28 soggy nachos.  So, I'm not really sure what happened there.";5;4;3;4;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

But considering how great the location is and what the median rates are in the city, they're actually quite affordable.  You can (usually) get a room around $199 and considering the Hampton Inn charges more than $200 and doesn't have half the style or amenities I much rather choose the Allegro if it was available.";4;3;2;0;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

They just had a some odd million renovation (which is absolutely gorgeous) but it still has its quirks and I like that. Came here late on Valentines Day 09 as the last part of a surprise evening from my husband. Upon entering, someone offered to take my bags, we bypassed because we only had a couple. My husband breezed through check-in while I sat in awe of the lobby (if they the movie ""Cool World"" was redone for this decade - this lobby would be in it). I'm sure the rooms vary in size, but we got a huge corner one with enough room for me to do if a flip flop ( I would assume if I were a gymnast). The room had the usual modern updates - iPod clock radio, plasma TV, soft robes, etc, sleek furniture and decor. I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!)

I had originally reserved at Hotel Burnham but due to a snafu on their part, they had to send me over to Hotel Allegro. So, into a cab I go for yet another leg of my journey (it was so close I could have walked easily but I didn't argue when cab fare was shoved in my hand.) I was a little annoyed at the change but all that was gone when I walked into the lobby. Hell-o there, gorgeous! If you've ever stayed in a Kimpton, you can expect business as usual here. Free wine in the evenings, ultra cool, plush, and fashionable digs, the best in technology (iHome, free wireless, HD flat screens), mostly helpful and pleasant staff, and room service orders you regret in the morning. I also really like their pens. They rank up there with Yelpstick as being an all time favorite tschotske. Highlights: - lucked out with a crazy huge room, super clean, very comfortable, and quiet - one bell hop in particular was a ray of sunshine and was supremely helpful with bags and directions - animal print robes for sassy relaxation times (see photo ;) Lowlights: - the other hotel sent over a bottle of wine for their mistake (how'd they know I'm easily placated with alcohol?) and I didn't have the minibar key to access a corkscrew. I called down to have it brought up and it never showed so I eventually had to go down myself. - valet parking is exorbitant (no self park) and other options in the area are nearly as bad. Best to leave the car out of it or plan for paying that much. - front desk staff can be a leeetle bit snooty. I paid $100 (with a lil help from my friend Mr. Shatner) and with taxes it was around $128 for a Friday night stay.

Another con is the location - it's not really close to anything but the theaters - for the price, you'd be better off staying in a much more central location.   One more con - our suite was supposed to have a ""two-person jacuzzi"" - it was just a bathtub with some extra spray-jet things.  Bogus!  Only two very small children could fit in there comfortably. I will say though that the suites are pretty awesome - they have this crazy rock'n'roll'coke vibe with a big portrait of a guitar and 80s patterned wallpaper.  And two nice flat-screen TVs.  And these trippy animal-print robes.";2;2;1;1;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The staff were also really helpful, friendly, and courteous and gave us some good recommendations of a place that would deliver to the hotel (it was really late and everything closes SO early in Chicago!). It was very convenient and easy to get to other places in the city from it, making excursions easy and convenient. My first impression of the room was that it was ridiculous. In a good way, mind you, but ridiculous nevertheless. Cream colored wallpaper with bright silver designs, a gigantic distressed glass mirror directly in front of the bed (hmm), which itself was pretty ridiculous with its blue velvet headboard and a large black bureau and minibar, with a huge flatscreen tv. Maybe I'm silly, but I really enjoyed the room. It was just ridiculous enough to be fun, and although all of the furniture took up most of the space, it was decorated loudly enough for a room twice its size. I didn't really mind the smallness of the bathroom either, although if we had been staying longer or for it might have gotten cramped. The bed was comfy, the thermostat adjusted the temperature of the room in a flash, and I felt like the room and bathroom were well cleaned before we arrived. The only bad thing was the room service. The guy who brought it up was pleasant and I guess I should have expected it to be expensive but I was NOT prepared to pay $28 for soggy, gross nachos without any salsa.

Typically I just stay at a Starwood to rack up the points, but my company has a new partnership with Kimpton Hotels so I thought I would try it. What a great alternative to the standard hotel. The service was amazing, even checking ahead of time to see what type of pillow I would like in my room and how many. I was plesantly greeted when I arrived, and went up to a nice sized, clean (although a little brightly colored) room. The beds were unbelievable comfortable and even though I typically have a very difficult time sleeping when traveling- I got a great night sleep. The best part about my stay was meeting a friend down in the hotel bar. We were going to go out, but due to cold weather we just decided to get a drink at the hotel. The brightly colored lounge played great music and had the feel of taking you to another era. The staff was friendly and martinis tasty and the whole atmosphere had the feel that you could walk up and sit with anyone in the bar and strike up a conversation. ADDITION Jan. 12, 2007: I just stayed again at this hotel... and here are some more things I love... the hotel is pet friendly (I didn't bring a pet) but I have recently learned that all Kimpton hotels seem to be pet friendly even the really upscale, expensive ones. They have a power strip next to the mirror so you don't have to climb under things and unplug lights to plug in your curling iron, they ask you what type of pillow you would like (it's the little things), and did I mention they have a complimentary wine hour after work...

Hotel was still great and remains one of my favorites, but this time I happened to be there on a weekend when it was 100% booked. I had never noticed the hotel being noisy before- but this time I had to call down to quiet down the room next to me (the hotel sent someone up right away and then they were quiet so it wasn't a big deal), but then on my fourth morning at the hotel a baby was crying at 5AM in the room next to me. There was not muffling of the sound between my room and theirs- the baby sounded like it was literally in a crib two feet from my bed. Still a great hotel- but noise is definitey a concern if the hotel is crowded.";5;1;0;0;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The welcome was wonderful! My first visit to Chicago and the front desk people were very helpful with how I could get around the city and some great places to see while I was there.  Over the next four days they showed that they remembered me specifically. The room was perfect. Not too big, not too small. Well equipped and very comfortable! The only downside is that they seem to rent out what should be common areas to groups. I had arranged to meet a friend that I hadn't seen since we were children in the lobby on evening. When I arrived back at the hotel to find her... she was lost in a sea of conventioneers.  We did find each other of course... we were the two people looking confused. I would recommend it to anyone. :)";4;1;0;0;N;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

First things first...go to the lobby for free wine!  You can't go wrong with that.

Our room was tiny but pretty.  The subway tile in the bathroom is gorgeous and pairs well with the baby blue ceiling.  All the mirrored surfaces entertained me.  It was nice to have two closets; one for him and one for me.  We didn't have bathrobes in our room.  Maybe because it was hot outside? I did sleep well here.  The two Roman shades allowed me to adjust the lighting in the room when morning rolled around.   It was impossible for two people to get any work done with the amount of surface area available, so I wouldn't recommend planning to work from a standard size room here. The location was very convenient to the freeway, but not as convenient to Chicago hotspots.  Things seemed to close early around us.

Its a hotel with a swanky, distinctive feel.  When I first walked in and saw the wide red staircase, I was convinced I'd gone to the wrong place.  The lobby fooled me into thinking I'd walked into a party room - so much so that I walked back downstairs, got in the elevator and pressed the lobby button, only to arrive back in the same place! My king room on the 14th floor wasn't a room you'd stretch out in, but it was fine by me.  The decor from the rest of the hotel followed me into the room, which was very comfortable and inviting.  The desk chair is great, with plenty of room to work on a laptop and spread things out.  The wide-screen HD television fits into the room nicely and, of course, has a great picture.  The bed sleeps well and the iPod compatible alarm clock is a nice feature. The room layout is funny - I've got two tiny closets, one complete with leopard print tank top and hot pants for purchase.  The bathroom is tiny at a glance, but just fine for your needs.  The vanity is long, so you don't feel cramped when laying out your toiletries.  They are still providing the Aveda products, as other reviewers have mentioned. The free wine hour is still going strong - not $100 bottle stuff, but it's the magic price - FREE.  I didn't try the morning coffee or the room service.  I took a peek in the mini-bar and found what I expect - airplane bottles with big price tags! I couldn't hear the ""L"" from my room, but I faced out over Randolph instead of Wells.  The plumbing noises didn't bother me much either - I think I heard the shower start up one morning out of 4.  The only noise that has been bothersome is that of the neighboring room raising their window shade - like mine, it takes a dozen pulls on a plastic chain that is a bit noisy.  Beautiful shade - poor mechanism. I'd definitely return to this hotel and it makes me curious aobut other Kimpton hotels.  I'd recommend this place to anyone - business or pleasure.  Its right around the corner from the Wells/Washington station on the ""L"" and the Clark/Lake subway station - so a train ride from either airport is very convenient.

I work pretty regularly with the Four Seasons Hotel in SF, so truth be told my expectation level is set pretty high for service and ambiance, but honestly people. The decor was... loud. I actually didn't mind the design clusterf*ck nearly as much as my boyfriend did, but I can see why it hurt his feelings: hot pink, gray, and gold couches with copper tables, and gray geometric wall paper? Please. You either have Special Needs or you're as mentally unstable as a serial killer if you picked that out and thought it looked good. And the service. Oooh gurl: Our reservation was through Priceline or some other 3rd party vendor - so even though we called to let them know we were showing up past Midnight and they assured us that they'd keep our room for us, when our flight was delayed and we showed up much later the room was gone. Fine, whatever, we get it - always book through the hotel. But then they promised to move our luggage for us into a bigger room with two beds, and we show up in the new room and of course they didn't move our stuff. So we call them to explain. Someone in our party had the old room key (which still worked, PS) so we grabbed our stuff ourselves cause it was taking too long, and then like three doormen came by the new room, letting us know our stuff wasn't in the old room, and we explained every time to each new person. Just communicate! There were a few other times something similar happened, so all in all everything got done 2-3 times or not at all. The one redeeming quality?

8/15/2012;JHFIpWXZ;NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q;"This visit was a follow-up to another trip in May 2012. I had some minor issues and hotel management contacted me and invited me to come back. I booked my room via the SPG website. I received an email from the concierge a week or so before my arrival, which was a nice change from last time. I didn't specifically tell them I was coming because I wanted to experience the hotel without thinking that they were treating me special because I complained once. Well, this time they gave me a lot more to complain about (and the issues were much more substantial than last time). It started when I had to wait 2 hours for my room despite requesting an earlier check-in. I totally understand that it's really them doing me a favor based on availability and clearly they were full this weekend. While I was waiting I had my luggage stored and then asked the concierge for help booking the Acura Experience. By the time my room was ready the Acura Experience was already full. I found out there was still some availability at the time I reached out to the concierge (and for about an hour afterward). Clearly she neglected to reach out on my behalf and I missed out. My room was finally ready and I gave the luggage guy my ticket to have it brought to my room. But for the fact that I was standing in line waiting to follow-up with the concierge, he would have given my suitcase to another guest. I saw him bring it to them and I purposely waited to intervene to see how he handled himself. When I finally said it was my bag the guest apologized, even though it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to do with the error. The luggage guy didn't say anything and I brought my bag upstairs myself. I really wanted to settle in quickly so I could get my trip started and start coordinating meeting friends. The employees continually reminded me that check-ins aren't guaranteed until 3:00 PM. I realize that, but it was disappointing especially since they knew about my request at least a week prior to my arrival. There were many other issues that came up and I'll save those specific details for management to address before adding them to a review.

That means that you let them NOT clean you room while yo are there and they give you 500 SPG points. Uhm...No! this is a good deal for me how? Clean my room! 3) I kid you not, The bathroom is so small that when you sit down to do your business, you have to lean back all the way so the toilet paper holder can go in front of you. This is the Cirque du Soleil version of going to the bathroom! 4) There is...wait for it...a kaleidoscope in my room on a stand that says ""wish"" umm...I don't get it. 5) On the foot of the bed is a faux fur runner.

The ""Sweat"" gym at this W is a joke:  two lousy bikes, three treadmills, and a few free weights in what might best be described as a room the size of a large janitor's closet.  They don't have a pool--which is fine--but with nearly 400 guest rooms, the gym could be 4x this size and it still might not be sufficiently sized.   Half the rooms in City Center face the obnoxiously loud L, which will ruin your night no matter how many $18 drinks you can stomach. I generally opt for the Westin on Michigan Avenue or the W Lakeshore whenever possible, but sometimes get stuck here due to logistics or availability.  I always cringe, but at least the rooms are clean and I get my Starwood points.";3;2;0;1;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

This was my first stay at a W and I was pretty taken aback when I thought I had accidentally stumbled into some club. The heavy odor of cologne in the air, the obvious mood lighting, and the yuppie crowd with drinks in their hands made me feel like I had just missed the annual Chicago gigolo convention. They play clubbish music most of the time too, which makes me feel like I need to dance everywhere I go rather than just walk. Anyway, the staff is incredibly friendly and gracious, overbearingly so honestly. Everyone kept asking me ""how are you sir? Is everything OKAY??"" Dude, don't be so insecure, I'm cool. The room was fantastic, though I'm not used to inspirational messages on the walls of my hotels. Loved the bath products, though we often didn't have enough. As to why this goes to 3.5 stars ... well like I said the staff was a little overbearing at times. I like good service, but this had an aggressive air about it that made it feel fraudulent somehow. The cleaning staff was not the best. They seemed disorganized most of the time. We opted for the going green option (my lady is a massive point hoarder) but then they cleaned our room anyway, negating the points until we got it cleared by the concierge. Also, the first night we arrived our comforter had several brown stains on it. It looked like a chocolate bar had been rubbed across it ... at least I hope to God it was a chocolate bar ... I need to shower now. The gym was okay, but small and lacking some basic stuff. They have 4 machines: 3 for leg exercises and 1 unwieldy one for ""all those other body parts."" If fitness is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere. And this is just nitpicking, but I'm not a fan of how they have to be hipster with everything. For example, the gym isn't called the gym. It's called ""Sweat."" I got off the elevator and was looking for the sign that said where the gym was. Finally I saw a sign that said ""Sweat (Arrow)."" It's one of those ""collapse your shoulders and tilt your head"" moments as if to say ""Really? Really now?"" Just call it the gym dude, everyone knows hipsters aren't going to be working out. But yes anyway, definitely a different experience for a hotel. Glad I gave it a go and I might just try another W somewhere else.";4;0;0;3;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

10/24/2011;0hMkZnT1k-onESPMVYN3-g;4ABktWZ7hBX86f0hYh5_bA;"Ws are a little bit hilarious and a lot awesome. Some of the hilarity is purposeful (the extra roll of toilet paper in the room came in a tidy little bag labeled ""backup plan""), but other things are hilariously unintentional, like the SNL-worthy ribbed black turtlenecks all the lounge staff was wearing. Sometimes I wonder if the W takes itself a little too seriously while trying to be the ""anti-hotel"". While my suite was more than roomy enough and felt clean, spacious, and modern, I did notice that I could hear hall noises so clearly they felt like they were happening in my own room. I didn't hear any neighbor noises (maybe I didn't have neighbors?) but whenever someone was walking down the hall it sounded like my door was just standing open. Fitted black turtlenecks or not, the service was flawless. The W staff came through for me in two major ways. (1) I bought too many pairs of shoes and couldn't fit them into my suitcase, so they sent up a FedEx box and form, and took it away from me once I packed. That was huge! Saved me either extra baggage fees or having to tromp through Chicago crowds to find a post office. (2) My flight got cancelled and I was able to scoot back my checkout time until 1 pm, no questions asked, no additional charges. Speaking of charges, this place is a tad expensive (WiFi was outrageous... don't they know the young, hip crowd likes their internets?), but it was definitely on par with other hotels in the area. When you get to a major downtown location, I notice there isn't much variance in the room prices anyway. I figure you have every other opportunity to stay at a ""normal"" hotel, so stay at a W when you can. It's fun, and the usual gripes can be found at any hotel. At least make it your ""Backup Plan.""";4;0;0;1;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

The changing lighting in the elevators and the house music (this is Chicago, after all!) in the lobby suits me just fine. Last time I stayed, I discovered I forgot my computer mouse. I popped down to the front desk (hidden in the back left of the lobby) and asked where the nearest store was so I could buy a new one. The clerk said, ""Hey, we'll just get you one and bring it to your room!"" Just like that! And, they did, in 5 minutes! I of course returned it when I checked out. It's the small things that really make service stand out for me. I've had room service here and the service and quality were on par with W's all over.

12/15/2011;vvt9nBOqs3N9ThQOyzQg1Q;E71L-LQ_nNIN70Fc-UOwLw;"So this is the hotel closest to my Firm's Chicago office, so I've stayed there many times. This past weekend motivated me to Yelp. I was 96 miles short of renewing Gold Medallion status on Delta, so I decided to take my wife to Chicago for her birthday to top it off. The W is right in the heart of the loop, and only a few blocks from my wife's favorite attraction, the Art Institute of Chicago. Also this is where she stayed last time we had a ""couple"" visit, two months before our first child was born, so I knew she liked it. Upon check-in they were extremely courteous (in part due to my Gold Starwood status), and when my wife mentioned it was her birthday, they not only gave us a room upgrade (offering the west side with more ambient sunlight, or the east side facing the courtyard with more quiet; Ed note: the west side faces the El, which is why the ""darker"" courtyard is quieter), but also offered us a selection of wine/cheese/fruit options. She chose champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Upon returning from our touristing that day, the chilled champagne and fruit were waiting. I never like to write a review without some constructive notes. First the hotel building is old (although it's been fully modernized), so the outside walls tend to be very cold in the winter. Opening the closet door felt like opening a refrigerator. The should consider more insulation. Also, the water closet is a bit small relative to modern hotels. We will of course return. I haven't even mentioned the trendy, nightclub feel of the lobby.";5;0;0;0;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

I stayed at the W Chicago for 3 days, and it was only memorable in how painful it was to stay there! Upon checkin, there was a line a mile long in the hotel to the point that the bar was taking drink orders from guests waiting to check in. Not free drinks for our trouble, but we had to pay and still wait! Then, we had made arrangements to receive a very important package at the hotel. When I checked in, they told me it was in security, and when I asked them to retrieve it, it was nowhere to be found. This carried on for 8 hours, until 1am when it finally appeared. Pretty annoying. The customer focus at this hotel is completely lacking. I asked to have the package shipped after we checked out, and I told them, no rush I don't need it sent overnight.

12/15/2006;QfPMf1M7w-e-3zxtkuV;sZxXpvmBUN2fSCtK_BZFoQ;"This place is way overrated.  Actually, for a party in the lobby area the place is fantastic and amazing.  But as far as the rooms... and people..  It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues.  Well, except Jessica is great! The rooms are small--not ""hotel in the city"" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small.  (The room 10' wide and was no more than 160 square feet).  The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop.  But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6"" deep...   I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) ... they came and fixed it, but still a hassle. There was no room service menu in our room, just a ""Dining In"" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service.  We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct.  They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup.  They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER?  How can room service not bring butter for toast?  It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice.  And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on...   (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ).  If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud.  Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard.   Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks.   And if you do go, avoid room 609... As cute as it sounds, it's just bad news!   I hope not all W Hotels are like this one.  Insanity reigns at the W City Center.";2;4;3;2;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

I've always found my rooms to be clean and nice. The service has always been very good, and it's really conveniently located. I know the rooms are a bit small, I can't deny that, but I don't spend much time in the room, so I don't care. I've never had anything but positive things to say about the W in the Loop.

10/11/2009;BIs185dMD3mI;XSLzmNxObUzuaIKxjBJ18Q;"I  haven't been to the W Chicago - City Center in a while, so I thought it was time for a visit while in Chicago.  I'm a points whore so doing a ""mattress run"" is a no brainer for me. Hotel is located in the southwest portion of the loop, directly across from the Quincy CTA station. I arrived at 11 AM and noticed the lobby has been renovated.  It's eclectic modern.  Oversized lamps and an s curve sofa make up the main area of the ""living room"".   I walk thru the living room and over to the pods which are located in front of the elevators and I'm greeted warmly by not just one, but two staff members. Since it was so early I was going to ask if my luggage could be stored until check-in time and ill go out and do some other things.  They tell me no problem and as a returning guest they've assigned me a nice suite.  Surprisingly I was told my room was ready.  The property recognizes my Elite status, asks if I need a late checkout and inquires if I need my receipt emailed to me after check out..  Little things like this go a long way.   I go around the corner and enter what I describe as the vertigo elevators of death.  If you look at that mural for too long, you'll be sure to earl. I walk into my room to find I've been upgraded to a room I'd previously been assigned.  The room has been renovation the wall and door that separated the parlor from bedroom have been removed. There is now one central wall that houses a flat screen TV for each ""room"" When you enter the room, there is a powder room on the right and closet on the left.  As soon as you pass thru the entry you're in the parlor portion of the room.  There is a wet bar are and a half wall with a TV above and a desk below.  The desk is nice and very practical but with only a few sockets. The furniture on the parlor side of the room is a bit tacky and its like the hotel was trying to hard to be eclectic.  It's just didn't do anything for me. The sofa is hideous! Passing thru to the bedroom side of the room, the decor is much better, now this what I  think a W should ""look"" like.  The W Bed is totally inviting.  On the wall is 40 HD TV that is identical to the TV in the parlor. Due to the location there is not much of a view, but the room does offer a view of the Quincy CTA Station, which is perfect for train spotters.  I thought being close to the train might cause some noise, but I didnt hear a peep Off the bedroom is a hallway that houses a closet and leads you to the bathroom.  The bathroom is rather awkward. Walking into the bathroom, on the left near the door is the sink and to the right is the toilet and tub/shower. Disappointing that the room doesn't have a double vanity and that there is no separate shower. The sink is pretty small and does not leave much space to spread out. Two people cannot use the sink area at once.  In addition, I got water everywhere.  The room doesn't have a shower only a tub, but it's got some nice hardware and good water pressure.  The bathroom is stocked with the typical Bliss sink side six pack of toiletries. Sweat has nice equipment, cardio machines and free weights, but there is no pool. Some additional information: There is a small business center on the mid mezzanine level. High speed internet available for free in the lobby and its $14.95 in room and the hotel offers Acura service within five miles of the hotel. At checkout on of the associates I'm familiar with said, ""you're one of my favorite guest. You're so funny.  You've got to stay with us for more than just one night the next time you come."" FINAL IMPRESSION If you'd like a good hotel while in Chicago this is the place for you.  Just know that on weekends there isn't much around the hotel, so you'll need to travel outside of the loop for dining and entertainment options. The overall staff attitude has greatly improved.  They appeared to be appreciative of being employed and more than willing to help.   After checkout, I had a small billing issue (this is why I always request that my folio be emailed) where 36 dollars of items from the mini bar was charged to my folio.  When I called about this, it took a minute to remove, the staff apologized and I wasn't made to feel like a liar.  Good recovery and follow-up was good.   I would return to this hotel based on price and time of year, in the winter months i would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue. It's a nice hotel for a business or leisure traveler, but better suited for the business traveler based on the location.";5;1;1;0;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
9/26/2010;KPJbyOyOrNeVh1IlPDk7yA;kRuMxqM-gSx_0FyJnwfY1g;"A lot of W hotels seem to be old Sheratons remodeled into a W hotel skin.  This W definitely felt like that - especially when you went upstairs with the low ceiling hallways and tiny rooms.  The overall decor, furnishings, and look of the hotel was probably a 3 - it wasn't the most creative W hotel lobby I've seen or rooms I've been in.   My Wonderful room was tinyyyy - if I sat at the desk to do work, I couldn't scoot my chair out all the way without hitting the bed - Anyone larger than me probably would have had trouble getting into the seat to begin with and I'm a 5 foot 2 small asian girl.  The bathroom was also very tiny with a very tiny sink.  It was pretty much impossible to wash my face in the sink without splashing water all over the tiny counter. That being said, for the week that I spent here I definitely started feeling at home and none of the above mattered to me.  The W hotel bed is HEAVENLY.  The room was well appointed and everything was placed in an space efficient way and I had enough room to function comfortably.  Flat screen TV and cable available.  Pretty fast wireless internet (it came free with my room - not sure if it applies to everyone), and I had a radio in my room so I was jammin out to music most of the time I was in the room.  I was having an awesome time in my room. What put the icing on the cake for this hotel was that the service was AMAZING.  Like possibly one of the best staff I've ever encountered at a hotel in my life.  And not the white glove butler type service you get at the Four Seasons where they HAVE to be at your beck and call, but everyone I encountered was sooo genuinely friendly - from the security guard who let me back into my room when I locked myself out of my room with no shoes on at 2 am, the concierge and the front desk, the cleaning ladies actually remembered my name, what room I was in, gave me extra bliss products.  I called down once for a toothbrush and they came instantaneously fast.  The guy who brought me room service was also extremely extremely cheerful and nice.  Every interaction with a staff here literally wowed me and left me with a smile on my face.   Now for some objective notes: Location is awesome.... if you're in Chicago for work.  It's in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of most large companies as well as near two L train stops.  That being said.... everything in Chicago's financial district (food-wise) shuts down at like 8 pm.. no joke and the streets in general were pretty deserted.  So.. because I work insane hours, room service was my best friend. Room service... argh.. despite their service being so amazing.. as can be expected from a hotel, it takes like 30 to 45 mins for them to bring you food - Comes on time though if you order breakfast.";4;1;0;0;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Nothing about it really stands out. The lobby has your typical w purple club-like feel. The amenities are above average. The surrounding area is dead at night. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel are the rooms. Big, spacious, and the bathrooms have doors (many Ws do not have walls between the bathroom and bedroom). I expect to be blown away by a W hotel and this hotel doesn't. You'll enjoy your stay but you might feel a bit underwhelmed. The W Lakeshore has other issues but it's a much nicer hotel if your heart is set on a W. If you're a Starwood person I'd recommend the Westin North River.";3;0;0;0;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

4/4/2011;ZDbgI7gbb4SW4AfR6RtvIg;hmvqH5zaWAAgJxan5eHilw;"This review is somewhat tempered by the fact that we got a good deal for the place, and the staff and service were mostly fine. I thought the lobby was interesting, although it takes a minute to even find the check in desk which seems apologetically superfluous to its main function, which is to double as an uber-contemporary lounge for the European twenty-something guests. You then enter the elevator under a flood of black light and Euro trance hits bumping through the speakers...at all times of day and night. I felt really sorry for the people's doors that are across from the elevators on each floor. Finally, the rooms are small to medium sized, as if you were in New York and not Chicago. Mattress was not so comfortable. The bathroom and shower were both nice and clean. The snack bar was dumped out over the shelves so the $8 Fiji water and accompanying organic snack bar stared at you in the face the entire time. A loud, clanging sound went off intermittently throughout the night whenever the air conditioning transitioned itself from one setting to another. It's a good thing I only needed to sleep one night of the two I was there. Otherwise it would have been miserable. On the bonus side we did get to interact with a famous and unfriendly hip hop star when our elevator stopped on his floor. So there's that. What I found most odd was that the hotel seems clearly suited for business travelers who need to be near the corporate offices in the area, but I really can't imagine most business travelers enjoying the place based on the above details and others (they had USA Today in the lobby, for example).   Summary: This hotel seems both pretentious and completely misguided for the area. I feel like these sorts of hotels might impress people who don't get to experience big cities very often but it just seemed tacky and dated to me, like a Puff Daddy music video, circa 2002. Not good for business travelers, not good for families with kids, not good for older folks. Good for European 20 somethings and perhaps the odd bachelor party, if they don't mind taking a cab to a part of the city that is alive at night. If not, they could always hang out in the elevator.";2;2;3;3;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Definitely strange at times (we had one ceramic white roller skate in our suite) but we found it more entertaining that anything else. The food in the lounge was great. They had free coffee all hours of the day, and I ordered a waffle that was delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything out of the room since the prices on snacks are so inflated.

Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV.

It has a very nightclub like feel.  The drinks are ok the service is awful. I think it was because I didn't have suit on or wasnt dressed properly.  They had good music.  The rooms are nice, bathrooms are much bigger than I would like. I would like to have had more room in for the room itself and less for the bathroom.  I love their bath products by Bliss, they are usually excellent and I enjoyed them. They change the carpets in the elevator so you know what time of day it is. The elevators I think were trying to be very 3d-ish but I think it just got me dizzy and was quite annoying. The workout room was small but they had voss for water.  I have been to the W's in New York and would say its about the same but probably quieter depending on which W you are at.   Trendy, dark boutique hotel.  Decent for the young hipsters and the like";2;0;0;1;N;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

The Radisson Blu Aqua is this pillar of awesomeness that is truly splendid both outside and in. They kept the wave theme throughout. The halls/room were decorated in an offbeat sort of way that I liked, with this blaring aqua colored carpet and then half the place had these little sparkly mica bits embedded in the floor, so it was like a disco ball in the entryway. The not so good: it was very quiet until Saturday night, when there was a huge party and the people next door were ordering room service at 2am. The doors on the rooms slam inadvertently. And when they were out on the balcony I could hear them speaking even though they were not speaking loudly. In the morning, a tourist ferryboat comes by on the river with a megaphone and it sounded like he was right in my ear. And I was on the 10th floor. But if you don't sleep in this wouldn't be an issue. The noise things did not dim my appreciation of the experience much. p.s. if you are staying here while going to a conference at the Sheraton (less than 10min walk), be aware that the most direct route across the river involves 3 flights of stairs down to a lower road level.

The lobby and rooms are impeccably decorated:  warm and inviting yet still sleek, modern and colorful.  The sparkly marble floors in the room are a stand out.  The shower and bath area is beautiful, and the rain showerhead is incredibly relaxing and upscale from most hotels I've stayed in.  The beds are super comfortable and warm.  Our room had a balcony, which was fantastic, even thought it was winter and we didn't get to use them.

5/2/2012;bP3N-SSa;-gwYYjpuBylPxvaQBHdxRA;"We were traveling from California to Chicago for the very first time. Prior to booking a hotel we did a lot of research online. Ultimately, we chose to book with Radisson Blu Aqua and I couldn't have been happier. A wonderful high end hotel & residence located in the heart of downtown Chicago's River North district.  We stayed for 5 days & 4 nights and every time we entered and left we were greeted by the doormen & other hotel staff. This hotel is state of the art in design and services. It ascends above the city and offers great views of downtown. It offers a sleek, sophisticated atmosphere, refined service and sweeping views at every turn. It's located just blocks from Chicago landmarks, such as, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave (high end shopping), and the Chicago Riverwalk. We rented a car from Midway Airport upon our arrival but we quickly realized that traveling by foot is much easier and faster. This may sound crazy, but Chicago traffic is 10x worse than in Los Angeles. Another downside, valet parking (with in/out privileges) is $45.00 a day at this hotel. A cab ride from the hotel to anywhere downtown cost us an average of 5-7 bucks one way. Another reason to walk or take a cab is because parking is a nightmare and very expensive throughout Chicago. If the weather was better we would have walked everywhere. Although the Filini bar is located in the lobby of this hotel, I did not factor my feelings into the 5 star hotel rating because they have their own yelp page. With that being said, I give Filini 1 star for food, service, and price of food versus quality. This place is full of hoity toity, pretentious individuals who wear designer clothing and think they are cooler than you. The service was horrible and I think the bartender forgot to put alcohol in our cocktails. Maybe because we were wearing jeans and t-shirts but we just spent the entire day walking around Chicago and wanted to end the night with food and a cocktail.... Ok back to the hotel... Our room had no refrigerator but it did have a coffee pot. There is a CVS Pharmacy directly next door where you can find cheap souvenirs, snacks, and a nice selection of alcohol (to stock up your room). Another great option for snacks, groceries, or alcohol is Mariano's Fresh Market which is located to the south of the hotel (3-5 minute walk). My fiancé and I both packed our gym outfits and had good intentions of using the fully furnished gym, but we found ourselves occupied with other activities.

Very lovely lobby area...a firepit that extends along one wall, comfy lounging couches, lots of luxury. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable with a big bathroom and rather large shower. It is in a perfect location, a few minutes south of the Chicago River and a block from Grant/Millenium parks..so you have those attractions plus the Mag Mile and a slew of restaurants within walking distance. I would knock off half a star because room service was very poor as far as replacing coffee..they would give me two decafs instead of a regular, but I am too easy going of a guy to be that harsh and will have to round up to a five star, because I would def. stay here again. Plus, they have their own Andriod app that is actually really cool and benificial for checking airlines, reservations, getting taxi service, checking out there restaurant (which we went to for breakfast twice and was really good), etc. The manager seems very commited to providing the absolute best for the hotels guests as he seems to respond to a lot of comments on here and it is nice to see someone who cares.

The staff could not have been more friendly.  While the hotel is still in start up mode, everyone was genuinely and naturally friendly.  We found this to be true of the front desk staff, housekeeping, the lounge staff and those in the restaurant.  We especially liked breakfast.  While on the expensive side, or pretty typical for higher end hotels, the food was especially good.  Try the crepes!  They are wonderful. The only downside I can see is the cost of parking at $51.  We knew this in advance and parked next door at an Illinois Center garage for $30.  Just a pet peeve of mine, as I'm happy to pay for a nice room and good service, but I hate how all the downtown hotels gouge you on parking or don't offer a package that includes parking. We did not use the pool but there is a nice two lane lap pool and hot tub plus health club.  The location was also very convenient to Millenium park, loop theaters and Michigan Avenue.  In short, this hotel was everything we wanted for a relaxing, quick escape from the burbs.";5;0;0;0;N;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

Looking straight out - we looked into an office building.  If we looked right  we could see Navy Pier and the river.  Looking left - we could see a sliver of the Wrigley building.  We did not face the park.  I'm not sure if that upgrade included Navy Pier views OR Millenium Park, so we didn't say something. I'm not sure the view we had was worth $9 a night. The room was relatively compact - but nicely laid out.  I loved how clean and new it was.  There was a wood-laminate floor - with marble floor  in the entry area and bathroom.  We had a king bed with great bedding.  It was very comfortable (though the pillows were rather ""mushy"" - it was good we had 6 of them).  The bathroom was beautiful - with a separate soaking tub and walk in shower.  It was also very spacious.   The sliding door to the bathroom was fine for us - but I could see if you were sharing a room with someone other than a spouse, it could be a problem privacy-wise.  It definitely didn't muffle any noises from the bathroom!   The closet area was laid out nicely with three drawers and a good-sized safe.   The hanging area, however, was a bit small.  It was ok for us for just 2 nights - but for a longer stay with 2 people or more - it'd be tough.   There was a good-sized flat screen TV and desk area.   The public areas were very nice.  We enjoyed the bar - and had breakfast one morning in the restaurant.  The food and service were excellent.   We didn't use the indoor lap pool and spa or health club.  The health club area was very large with great equipment and even a half basketball court.   In the lobby area - there were a lot of areas to sit and lounge.   We were rather surprised by the $51/night charge for parking.  That seems rather high to me, particularly as we didn't use or ask for in/out privileges.   We would definitely come back.  It could be nice in the summer with that outdoor pool area.";5;1;0;0;N;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

Barbara, the in-house the wedding planner was a breeze for the bride and groom to work with.  She was calm and thought of everything.  I too found communicating with her to be very easy.   The food was well beyond my expectations. The salad was not your average crank them out wedding salad.  The greens were fresh, the string beans delicious.  If you told me I was eating local organic produce, I would have believed you.  The steaks were so thick and delicious you would have thought this was a $150 per plate wedding meal, which I'm sure it was not.  The Holiday Inn outsources their cakes to Alliance Bakery.  I'm not a big wedding cake fan - because most just aren't that great.  This one was fantastic.  (Chocolate buttercream, chocolate cake, raspberry filling.) The venue let our friends bring in their own beer from outside.  This is unheard of at a hotel wedding venue.  Upcharging alcohol is a big part of how they make their money.  But our friends were able to pick up fantastic beer and bring it in to be served at the bar.  It saved them a bundle. They had an open bar all night long.  I'm not big into mixed drinks so I cannot comment on that aspect. Free rooms were included for the bride and groom and parents on the night of the wedding.  The couple said that nice perks like that were present throughout their whole experience. The only things I did not like were: They typically don't provide a holding room for the wedding party to wait in.  The part of the room where they stood for their ceremony had an exit door and exit sign right behind them.  Not the most beautiful backdrop to a wedding ceremony.  And when the clock struck leaving time - they threw on the florescent lights and herded everyone out as though it were a police raid.  I have worked catering and understand well the need to get guests out so crew can start to breakdown.  I'm sure their method was effective in doing so, but they could have used some more tact.   These negatives were minor compared to the service, the good price, the good food, and great views. I think this is one of the best kept secrets as far as Chicago wedding venues go.  Five stars indeed.";5;1;0;0;N;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

The parking was very easy and compared to other city hotels was reasonably priced for staying the night with in and out. I believe it was right around $34. The check in was quick and easy, as it should be at 2AM. Although the guy checking us in wasn't very talkative or warm to us. The room was a very large with a king bed and a sitting area. The view was not of much however this hotel does offer some amazing views. I would actually say some of the best in the city because of it's position. A definite plus to this hotel. Some things that bother me about hotels that HI had on the list. 1. I hate when electronics aren't in working order when walking into room. The TV was unplugged, the batteries needed changed in the remote and the clock needed set as it was  blinking. All simple things but also all simple things for the hotel staff to check on to make sure the room looks put together. 2. No info on Chicago in the room or info about the hotel. There was no book anywhere about restaurants in hotel, if room service was provided beyond breakfast, pool hours, etc. 3. Two VERY small pillows in the room isn't sufficient. Overall, I wouldn't stay again but it WAS  a great hotel for a quick sleep in Chicago. I prefer a hotel with a more boutique feel and attention. Also, for me, the location wasn't ideal to being where I like to be in Chicago. For a family trip, reunion or even a guys weekend, I think this hotel would fit well.

I help host an event (the Chicago(ish) Tweetup) twice a year and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is our go-to hotel for a variety of reasons: The sales staff is wonderful and always happy and quick to accommodate us, and they even work to find rooms at the group rate for last-minute travelers. The staff at the front desk and concierge are also friendly and willing to assist guests with their needs; I've yet to encounter a rude staff member in my five visits to this location. The rates are reasonable, and their block/AAA/Priority Club rates are often even better (call often to check on AAA rates, as they change from week to week, often going lower the closer to your arrival date). The location is fantastic, with views of the Chicago River and the city's lovely, gritty architecture, whether buildings or bridges. Thanks to the Brown Line Merchandise Mart El stop, it's possible to reach the hotel via public transportation from either major Chicago airport and avoid car rental and parking fees altogether, though check the hours for the Brown Line, as it does not run all night. The Cityscape Lounge is pricey and the service is on the slower side, but it's ideal for a cocktail hour kickoff and the bar food is pretty good. (The view from the lounge is incredible.) The lobby is comfortable and perfect for a larger gathering to congregate, with comfy couches/tuffets and outlets for charging smartphones/tablets.

They were able to give me a very good rate for a block of 12 rooms at $129/room per night. Although we didn't have our wedding at the hotel, our guests were encouraged to stay here for the following reasons: 1. Great location for public transit, cabs or driving. (Parking is expensive at $34/night, but you do get in/out privileges.) 2. Great rate for Chicago. The city views (if you're lucky to not get a room overlooking the pool roof) are out of this world. Just stunning! 3. Great service. I worked directly with the sales office (thanks Diane and Charnita!) and they were able to accommodate some people that missed the reservation cut off. And they gave them the special rate as well. 4. Our room was huge! I had asked nicely about getting a comp room (being the bride and all, I thought I'd ask!) and was pleasantly surprised that we were given a suite! The room had a king size bed and a big sitting area with couch, coffee table and four lounge chairs (Rm 2048). The view was a northern view of the lake and the Hancock. Very, very nice! Only drawbacks: 1. The bar was packed on the Saturday night (I think there were 2 weddings going on in the hotel) and service was slower than molasses, but the view is awesome, so waiting wasn't that huge of a deal. 2. Having to go all the way down to the main building lobby to smoke. Yeah, I know, that's really not the hotel's fault and I really should just quit, but it is a pain in the ass when you're super anxious about your wedding day and having to wait on everyone else to be ready so you can get ready, etc. etc. 3. Room service prices were ridiculous. I recommend you go down to the deli in the main building lobby for breakfast! $4.25 got me an egg, bacon and cheese bagel sandwich and a cup of coffee. The same would have cost around $14 from the room service menu. Blah. Overall, I'd definitely say we enjoyed our stay at the Mart Plaza.

The room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (19th floor). The wireless internet was sometimes slow, but I was able to do what I needed to do. Service at the front desk was helpful. I also enjoyed visiting Italiasia (the hotel restaurant) and the Skyline Bar. A few complaints -- the ""Business Center"" was tiny and charged per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. And while restaurant prices for lunch and dinner were reasonable (including for room service), breakfast was insanely expensive. Thankfully, the food court at Merchandise Mart has a Dunkin Donuts and a Jamba Juice, so if you're willing to take a walk (all inside, through the corridor connecting the buildings on the second floor) you can get your coffee, bagel, and banana for less than $12. The location was great -- easy access to CTA and some restaurants, right on the lovely Riverwalk, and within a cheap cab ride of everywhere I wanted to go. I'd recommend it to others who are visiting Chicago who.";4;2;0;0;N;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

It was very easy to get a room block that could accommodate and everyone we spoke to since the wedding has nothing but amazing things to say about their experience, the rooms, service and of course - the views!! Mart Plaza starts on the 15th floor of the Chicago Suntimes building and looks out over the river and the Chicago skyline. They also give the bride/groom and the bride/groom's parents their room free the night of the wedding. This is on top of their VERY reasonably priced rooms for wedding blocks. In addition, my husband's parents are divorced and they gave both sets of parents the free night. The ceremony, cocktail reception, and move into the reception was swift and flawless.

The reservations staff shared updates about our room blocks in a timely manner when we requested updates. The catering staff was so attentive throughout the cocktail hour and the sit down meal.  All of our guests received the courses in a timely fashion, and the food was delicious. If you go for the mid-level wedding package, the steak for each guest is huge and very well prepared. At one point, my husband stepped away from the table during dinner, and a staff member took his plate to make sure it was warm when he returned. Thank you to everyone! These are among the reasons we choose the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza as our ceremony and reception location: - Barbara Martin is great. - Affordable with lots of perks including comped rooms and parking for us and our parents the night of the wedding along with free breakfast the following morning. - The LaSalle room was just the right size for our 100 guests (plus dance floor) and the view of the Chicago is great (and makes any decisions about decorating or coming up with a theme so easy -- Theme: Chicago, Decorations: Look out the window). - Close to public transit for our out-of-town and city-residing guests. - Reduced parking rates were available to our driving guests. - We were able to have a block of rooms for Friday and Saturday night available to our guests at a reduced cost without having to make a financial guarantee that we would fill the rooms.";5;0;0;0;N;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

It is frustrating that they don't care enough about their guests to even take the time to read their complaint email. Save yourself and stay some place else. I have NEVER said anything like this to ANY other businesses, but the experience I had was just god-awful. Worst Hotel Experience ever, and this is supposed to be a 4-star hotel.

On the other hand, I really wish I could review their international locations. The properties in the Middle East (Dubai Festival City, Abu Dhabi) are beyond 4-star service, facilities and amenities - definitely a well-deserved 4 stars.  I would rate the property in Dubai at nothing less than FIVE. But then again... the United Arab Emirates would surpass even the biggest critic's expectations!

The room was dated but impressive. The room was probably  setup 15 years ago, and had minimum maintenance since then. The floor tiling was clearly worn. The suite is on the 35th floor. The wind at that level can be severe and there was clear wind noise from the windows, to a level where we had to close the door to the bed-room to be able to fall asleep at night. Maybe time for an upgrade. The room has two bedrooms and a nice living room. No less than 3 restrooms, 2 showers, so quite nice. The beds are very comfortable. The daily internet rate is $19, which is a bit steep, for mediocre speed. The room has an internet terminal and there is wireless access through iBahn. The hotel elevators were good and well maintained. The lobby is attractive and the bell stand quite effective. The front desk was slow in processing but very courteous once they serviced us. There is a Starbucks just off the lobby. Nice! They have flight information available in the lobby, very convenient. The restaurant on the mezzanine level is OK but not great. Great place to stay if you want more of a historic visit to Chicago. Great location, but this is a hotel that has not seem much updates / maintenance since 1980.

I used to have 2 roommates and a boyfriend. So when Valentine's day rolled around, I decided that a better way to spend it was to NOT stay home on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend AND 2 roommates.... So I booked us a room here for a romantic Valentine's mini-getaway!! Service at the hotel was very courteous and prompt, from check-in to check-out. From reading the other reviews, I'm guessing that the hotel has different rooms in different sections. Well our room was gorgeous, a high floor, no street noise and a kickass view of Michigan Ave. The bathroom was large with marble countertops and shower/bath, but most importantly it was clean! The Intercontinental is located right a decent section of Michigan Ave with lots of good restaurant options in the near proximity. As a result of that, we definitely did not eat at the hotel or order room service. We tried to have a nice romantic walk down Michigan at night, but February in Chicago = COLD!!!! So we went back to the hotel and went swimming. The pool area was really nice and WARM. I'm willing to bet that they have one of the nicest hotel pools anywhere in Chicago. Note to parents: it doesn't seem kid-friendly, the minimum depth at the pool was like 7 feet. All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing and romantic time staying here, and I got a beautiful diamond necklace from the boyfriend as a gift. So what can I say??

Now, the qualification: We checked in to the Intercontinental because our friend was having her wedding there, and  we didn't want to have to drive back home after a late night drinking. Plus, I've always wanted to stay there. First bad thing: the front desk gentleman was very pushy about selling their ""Ambassador"" program for $150. I told him we were short on time and needed to be off in a hurry. He actually held our room key in the air out of our grasp while he continued to rattle on for five minutes about the Ambassador program and how he really thought it would be a good idea for us to go ahead and sign up so we'd get a free upgrade to a suite. We were three minutes late to the wedding and had to watch the procession from the rear. So, we put that behind us and enjoyed a nice reception in the Intercontinental ballroom. Nobody can say the hotel isn't beautiful inside. Going back to our room at 11:45 we noticed that the room's  windows overlooked a brick wall - the new tower next door. OK, so no view. I suppose that a view of Michigan avenue runs an extra $100 at least. Fair enough. But the other problem quickly became  apparent - rooms on the 9th floor have a ballroom directly below them. We were able to heard the band talking between numbers, as well as the loud, thumping music. And I mean it was loud. Not acceptable. After a little run-around trying to get a manager, we were offered $100 off. Nope. They couldn't tell us when the music would stop. Finally, begrudgingly they offered to refund our money and let us go home since there were absolutely no rooms available to move us to. (However, I bet if I forked over the $150 for the Ambassador program., a suite upgrade would have magically appeared...) So in the end we would up driving back home, tired and hung over. Shame on us for trying to go to sleep in peace at 11:45pm... Two stars because, come on, this is the Intercontinental Michigan Ave. They should have their shit together and not make me feel that I am some lousy peon who gets the third-class room in steerage because I don't have status.

Our room was in the older of the hotel's two towers, the one that used to house the Medina Athletic Club.  The room was on the 25th floor, and had great views up and down Michigan Avenue and out to the west. The Room itself was very spacious, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate shower and bath. We got brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the buffet was off the chain in terms of quality and selection.  It was also priced accordingly . . . The topper, though, was the fitness facility housed in the hotel.  You have not only the gorgeous and historic swimming pool, but a full complement of cardio and weight equipment.  And the dry sauna was delightfully hot. On the down side (and hence the missing star), this place nickels and dimes you on things like internet.  I've heard not-so-great things about the promptness of their room service, but, almost needless to say, we did not order room service.  (At $18 for a ""Maxwell street polish sausage,"" can you blame us?)";4;1;1;0;N;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

The hotel bar is really cool and fun.  It's open on two sides so it makes you feel in the center of things.  It opens and extends into the lobby. There is also a restaurant in the hotel called Eno on Michigan Ave.  This is probably the best wine bar I've been to, or at least the one I most enjoyed myself at.  It has very subdued lighting and a somewhat dark and rustic decor making it very romantic.  They have 700 varieties of wine and killer cheese plates and hand/home made chocolate truffles. Another great thing about this hotel is it's unconventional layout.  The first few floors of the hotel are a twisting and winding maze of mixed levels, mysterious statues, large doors to ballrooms, chandeliers, and places to peep out over the lobby.

So instead of bugging your server to remind you which-is-which, you get a cute little card that you can tear out and bring home to enable future wine + cheese awesomeness.   They had a cheese flight that had ""coronary"" in the name.

I would say that Hotwire/Groupon are the way to go for this place.  I think single rooms with a King-sized bed usually go for around $300, and that simply is too much for what you get.  The room was rather small, and as a result the furniture was awkwardly placed, with the TV oriented perpendicularly to the bed and difficult to watch from the bed.  But for $99, with access to a gym and a pool (neither of which we used--it was a laaaazy weekend)?  Definitely a deal.";3;0;2;0;N;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

When not in my room, I was attending the conference I was in Chicago for.  Most of conference rooms were good, but some seemed to be extra wide hallways.  The reason i did not do anything else in the hotel, like go the gym, is because everything cost extra.  I have never been to a hotel where everything (including the gym) was a la cart.

Check in was fast and my husband had no problems.  (We typically stay at Intercontinentals and have had our share of problems with checking in on past vacations.)  The room was clean and decent - had 2 full bathrooms and we had a view of Michigan Avenue from the 10th floor which was nice.  The location was great and it is right across the street from a mall and right by all the North Michigan shopping areas.  I was impressed with the bed - it was very comfortable.  Bed and pillows were perfect - and for me, that doesn't happen very often.  The hotel has a place called Eno which is a place where you can sample wine, chocolates, and cheese and the Michael Jordan Steakhouse is also inside.  Valet and doormen were very helpful which was appreciated.  The only downfall of our trip and the reason why I didn't give the hotel 4 stars is because it was very loud as I was trying to go to sleep.  The walls appear to be very thin and the group in the room next to me were being very loud - laughing, talking (I could tell you every word in their conversations...) and just having a good time.  Now I understand that I am in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, however, I am a customer too and I feel that at 1:30 a.m, I should be able to get some rest.  I called downstairs to ask the front desk what could be done and she said she would send security up....around 2:30 a.m., the noise finally stopped.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if I didn't have a train to catch at 6:00 a.m.  But anyways, that was the only thing I didn't like, that it took security almost an hour to get the people quieted down.  Good hotel otherwise.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Right now the pool is closed for renovations and hotel valet overnight is $54.  Wowza, good thing we took a cab.  Cabs are aplenty in this area so that was no problem, but Michigan Ave. is very trafficky, so you may pay more because you sit in traffic a lot.  Also, the hotel in general is a bit noisy because cabbies like to honk their horns as if it's gonna make anyone move faster, and that can be heard from inside the hotel at times.";3;0;0;0;N;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

When we were outside, having cocktails, I wasn't all that impressed. Then when our party was allowed to proceed into the ballroom, phwooaar! It was love at first sight. The dance floor is big, the columns impressive, with two sweeping stairwells that curve oh-so-sweetly. I think they have a small platform too, perhaps for a band, or just some drunken exhibitionists who want to do the electric slide for everyone to see?

I did not find the seating arrangement  ideal, as we were jammed in between two parties (a drunk, touristy group, and an awkward first date). I'm all about a ""howdy"" meet-your-neighbor communal table, except...not in a wine bar. Wine bar is for intimacy and intrigue! How can you get that when you hear every whisper, or non-whisper, to your left and right. However, I will forgive them somewhat because they had great chocolate (pepper! jalapeno! raspberry!) and decent cheese selection (Blue Haze, yum) and I had a really rather sublime Oregon pinot noir that came in just the most delicate bowl of a glass. Ahhh, bliss. Then we kind of wandered into the pool and fitness center to check out their pool. Wow, it's awesome. Very Egyptian meets Spanish tile.

We did not vallet - we had family in town that took our car for the night.... 54 bucks for a day is obnoxious. When we checked in, we had a King Suite reserved.  We were traveling with an infant & two baby sitters in tow.  The room was nice, but there was no seperation between the sitting room and bed room, eventhough it appeared so on the website.  They also said there were two bathrooms... while this room had one.  My husband called the front desk, and they told him that nothing else was available.  Boo... but we would survive.  I also had read somewhere that there was a fridge available in each room.  One more call to the front desk reveiled the fact, that only the mini bar is available.  I was informed though by the room service man, that if I opened the bar, removed items, but left them with the bar, we would not be charged, because it was not one of those lame pressure sensitive ones.  Yay!   So, my husband went to check in with some friends about the quickly impending wedding (1 hr away) and on his way back to the room he checked at the desk and was able to get us the room that we were looking for!   TIP - after booking we joined the frequent guest club... so when they asked my hubbie if he belonged they gave us the upgrade. The new room had a bedroom with french doors separating and two bathrooms.  The only downside - it was on the smoking floor.  The floor was not bad though, air cleaners in the hallways and in the room(as long as they are on)... so i was not feared for my 6 month olds lungs, and my smoking baby sitters could smoke in their bathroom - with the fan on. The room was very nice.  No complaints - with the comment that the shower head's back was missing. Huge bathroom off the bedroom.... smaller one off the sitting room!

The desk the LCD was on was chipped. I felt like i was in a motel 6. The blue chair, it was white smugges/stuff on it. I'm thinking this can't be happening. This must be a bad dream. Wow!

The gentleman front desk/ays dept stated that if i would like to have an engineer to come and fix it. I'm thinking at 4am in the morning and my fiance and I will have to get up and put cloths on because they placed us in a room they knew was not used in months and that the air condition didn't work. So i said no, because it's going to be an inconvenience and checkout is at 11am so I stated that it wouldn't help. The gentleman explained to me that the building is old and needs some minor repairs and he apologizes. I'm thinking WOW!!!! But then, an Express checkout/bill was placed under my door. LOL!!!! But I was not offered and continential breakfast or a refund or anything. LOL!! Wow!!! Not even an room change was offered. Lmao!!!

Pros: Wifi worked all over the hotel for me There is a Starbucks in the hotel (with limited hrs of 6 am to 8 pm) Great location on the strip, especially with all the new stores popping up on the street Room service was super nice and generous (although food sucked but since when has room service ever had good food?!) Morning concierge staff was nice and helpful Air conditioner worked GREAT on the hot nights I was there Huge workout room Cons: Room did not have the most pleasant smell (smelt like feet) Infrequent hot water availability (I wear a pliable splint that needs to be heated up and had to sleep one night without it) A wet pillow case was left in the room by cleaning service Check-in concierge was extremely rude Overall, the hotel was in an amazing spot! I won't lie, it was nice when I went shopping and had a quick stop in between. But in reality, I felt like I was at a super 8 or something of that caliber. There was one morning when I left (8am) and before my door even closed, a cleaning staff member jumped in to start cleaning the room. I understand you have a job to do but at least wait until the door is closed and use the room key! Warning, if you are not a big fan of noisy lobbies then stay clear of here. The hotel bar is in an atrium and all noise there is amplified. I didn't mind it but in the morning it was strange. If you have stayed with Marriott before, you might be disappointed.

SERIOUSLY, the entrees and sides were the best I've had at a wedding to date, and i'm not just saying that because it was my wedding.

I'd rather not dodge suitcases with children sitting on them while trying to get outside. You look at other reviews on here and think the bathrooms must be small. If you've ever lived in a one bedroom apartment, you'll enter your room and then laugh. Seriously no different than any bathrooms I've ever had in an apartment, why would you expect anything more in a hotel room? The room itself was great, we had a view over Michigan Avenue on the 36th floor. The bed was so comfortable, and we had plenty of space. Also pretty sure any reviews complaining about elevators are VERY outdated. There are 6 ""low-rise"" elevators that go to the 28th floor and then 6 for the higher level floors. There was almost always one sitting in the lobby to head up, and if there wasn't, you barely had to wait...unless you were the idiots who weren't aware you had to press the button and not just stare at it because you don't have elevator buttons on your farm in Iowa. If you're logical enough not to bring a car here, there are so many buses that come right nearby and it's an easy walk to many different places. Concierge lounge was pretty meh. The drinks were hardly discounted like they are elsewhere (wow, a whole $11 for a cocktail instead of $13 down at the regular bar!). The breakfast wasn't that impressive either and we ended up going elsewhere for it after morning #1. The bar was always pretty busy, we only went there on Christmas for a drink before dinner.

The bed was quite confortable and the blackout drape very welcome. There were really no complaints about the room... but for this: Being a geek I was surprised that wireless was only available on the first few floors not in the rooms. Instead there was a hardwire. The conference comp'd the internet access but I must rant anyway: YOU BLITHERING IDIOTS! In case it had not occurred to you, this is the 21st century. Internet access for most of us is not an 'optional' luxury. WTF is your problem Marriot nickel and dime'ing people for net access? I'd trade the f'in TV access straight across for the net access.

Getting out of Chicago in the morning was super efficient, driving down Ontario to I-94 for freeway access. We did have some trouble getting to the valet parking entry when we first arrived, as that entry is on Rush street, and when we went past it, it took us awhile, with the one-way streets and the river, to loop back around. The lobby is incredibly busy and hopping, but even so, we managed to check in very quickly on a Sunday. We also had access to our room before the posted check-in time, which was a wonderful treat. We had a room on a  high floor with a king bed, but we didn't have views of the lake (ask for that!). The room was not large, but it had everything we needed and was beautifully appointed and very comfortable.

I'm sure there is an excellent logistical reason for why they did that, but it was a pain if we wanted to visit other people in our party. 3) No mini-fridge in OUR room at least (we found others had mini-fridges in their rooms) but their rooms had one bed as opposed to two? Perhaps that was the difference? 4) Small bathrooms.

Unfortunately, it was during high school proms, the lobby was swamped with 4 different proms the weekend and the attendees of the conference (McCormick Convention Center). I was not impress with the wait in the elevators and because it was so crowded with unsupervised teenagers and professionals, getting to the top floor was a hike. The hallway was very narrow and gloomy with unattractive 70's carpet. The room was very tight. It was two double with a 'view' but it was not much of a view. The got us excited during check in but the room/ window was against a wall so we can only see out at an angle. The bathroom was very ugly. The tub was standard and small. Very dated. The toilet was old and the seat was chipping so I can't tell if they cleaned the toilet or not. The closet door did not slide; we called someone to fix it and not one came by to fix the door during our stay. (5 days of neglect). The iron did not work so we had to call for another one. We needed to iron our clothes for work. That was also a drag. Bar was small and dingy. The desk did not know of late night restaurants. Getting a cab was about 20-30 minute wait. I was not impressed at all. The city is full of fun things to do but at the end of the day, we dreaded coming back to our room.

2/23/2010;vq;5qDIr_wCCoLMrHDHoB_pNQ;"This is a review of their banquet facilities only; my graduate school alumni board, of which I am a member, recently held an awards ceremony at the Marriott and I think that it wound up being what is expected from a top-tier banquet hall, but with a few outstanding perks: *The entrance immediately gives you a feeling of being somewhere important. You walk in the door to a stair entrance down to the lounge/lobby and bar area, which is very welcoming. *The first course, a tomato bisque crostini (crostada? crostadelicious is all I have to say) was impressive- rich tomato cream soup served in ramekins covered with a pot-pie like flaky crust. Pretzel rolls and a variety of others complimented the first course really nicely and had me excited for the rest--dinner (chicken/mashed potatoes) and dessert (tiramisu) were fine but not noteworthy. Average wedding food fare. *The decor: strange jellyfish/bubbly like chandeliers that weren't so weird as to be distracting, but were still pretty enough to comment on. The room decor and lighting overall were pleasant. Also, to enter for dinner, a guy walked around with a mini-vibe set playing to get our attention to announce that it was time to sit down. Old school style.   Otherwise this was a pretty average experience. The house red wine at the bar upstairs (7th floor was where we were at) was Estancia, which I have found is becoming increasingly common. It's okay but not preferable. I'm sure that has to do with our budget as well as the Marriott's own choice. Anyhow, it's a nice venue with a few defining factors and it served our purpose quite well. I would use it again.";4;0;0;2;N;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

In any case, as other Yelpers have already noted, the Marriott Downtown costs as much as it does due to its location!  Two nights and you're looking at throwing down half of that rent check if not all of it.  Yes, the Marriott certainly is on Michigan Avenue (aka the Magnificent Mile, which isn't so magnificent when you don't have any ducketts to spend) and it's in the middle of a lot of goings-ons but the interior is quite a labyrinth of amenities.  I felt like a Hobbitt looking for a gold ring!   Upon arriving, it took me a good 20 minutes to find my room.  I asked about 4 other people and they were lost too.  Well, I found it, finally!  I have to say that I LOVED the view.  However, it was considered a Club Room upgrade and I didn't see how.  The room was rather small.  I mean, I can't complain but then again when I'm paying a couple limbs my last two nights there, I would have loved something a bit more grand than what was received. So, why did we pick this place for such a large business meeting (approximately 300 attendees!)?  It is one of the only hotels in Downtown Chicago that can accommodate parties of that size.  Oh, to top it off, let's confuse guests even more by having an escalator from the 7th floor spit you right out onto the 5th floor!?!  Wow, really?  I have to cut them some slack though because the staff was really nice and helpful.  However, along with check-in, they should give hotel guests a Tom Tom GPS navigation system to find their way around.";3;0;1;0;N;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Unfortunately, for $199 a night internet deal (back in 2003), my room I rented for 4 of my friends to celebrate my birthday was super tiny. Also, when I set up reservations, they asked an odd question where I had to put another person down for the credit card hold.  So when I checked in they requested my card and my friend's card which didn't make any sense since I was the person who was paying the whole bill. Anyway, it didn't really matter since we only needed a place to crash. Afterwards, the billing was screwed up and I noticed on my bank statement that I was double charged for the room so I had to call my bank for them to withhold the charge and speak to  a Marriot resident regarding the billing error.

First off...the ""Very Berry"" is maybe the best thing ever. It's a deliciously dangerous drink with real pieces of fruit. I'm not even sure what's in it (some acai vodka, some other random liquor, some juice or something), but it was to die for. I believe it was $13 (not sure...I didn't pick up the tab, fortunately)...not sure I would ever justify paying that much for a drink, but if I were going to this would be the drink to do it. We ordered a variety of food, and some of it was pretty decent (the BBQ chips topped with cheese and bacon) , but others not so much (flatbread pizza...not a fan of their sauce)...probably because it wasn't an actual restaurant (that I'm aware of), but mainly just a bar. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, with some curtains between the long sofas for privacy between parties. We had like 20+ people with us, so that wasn't an issue. It was a pretty nice place to have an afterparty after a crazy busy day/night of fundraising for the arts. My feet were killing me and I would have been happy anywhere I could sit down, but I'm glad they chose the Marriott to host us.

The hotel staff was definitely friendly during check-in, walking around the hotel, and check-out. they cleaned the room everyday immaculately, to the point I thought I walked into a new room.

First day's lunch was actually an amazing piece of work, however, since it was the ONLY lunch option for the day and I don't like eggplant, well, I was really hungry after lunch. After a normal salad, we were served up truly a beautiful dish of Eggplant Parmesan.  3 Medium thick slices of eggplant were breaded and fried and then stacked with a ricotta/onion mix layered in between.  Melted shredded parmesan was on top and a spicy marinara was draped on and around the dish.  Truly magnificent if that's what you like.  Dessert was a slice of Eli's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake. Second day's lunch was much better.  We started off with a cream corn chowder soup (it was a chilly day too) and then it was a Cobb Salad with really fresh ham and turkey sliced on it.  Dessert was this awesome lemon meringue tart that was to die for. Both our private open bar and the bar in the lobby of the hotel served up a wide variety of bottled beers and extensive wines.  There pretty much wasn't anything you couldn't handle. Also, free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel is always a plus, especially when you're a guest for a conference and you're not checked in.  Valet was slow as heck, but I parked in the lot just to the northwest of the hotel for much cheaper.";3;0;0;0;N;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Starbucks There was a line in the morning, but you can't beat the convenience of having one in the lobby (or one right across the street, or one two doors down.....)

Staff Nothing but great things to say about the staff.  Everyone that we encountered was just fantastic The Bad: Elevators If you were on floors 29 on up (which we were) there was always a significant wait for the elevators.  There was a bank of eight elevators servicing these floors, but only two were running.  Someone told me that the staff claimed this was temporary, but I had the same issue on both visits, which were eight months apart. Street Noise Maybe I'm just a country bumpkin, but there sure was a lot of street noise coming up to the 37th floor.  It may have just been our particular room, bu it seemed like the seals on our window weren't tight and a lot of outside noise was getting in.

I wouldn't, and have certainly stayed in some less than desirable places.   Yes, this is a good location, and yes the free bar/lobby/2nd floor wi-fi is great, and the bar area is fantastic (lined with granite and marble, also chilly when the temperature drops) but when it's cold, nothing else matters. Comment from the manager- ""Call me and I'll bring you some hot tea and blankets when you're ready to go sleep.  A discount on the room won't make it any warmer.""

The room includes a computer with some pre-loaded tourist information, but why not offer up internet if you have it installed? Finally - greatest pet peeve -- $2 to check a bag with the concierge??

We chose this hotel because of its location to be close to the museum but far enough from the hustle and bustle of shops in the Magmile. This hotel is part of a history and the decor was dated but I think that's what makes it a little bit charming that its not all linear and too modern on the public areas. I loved the view of the Lake. One thing, they need more concierge on their staffing. They had one concierge on a Friday evening and I thought it was just annoying that we had to wait for over 15 minutes just to get a small map of downtown.

Great location for what we wanted to do (to tour the loop and museums basically). Easy train access about two blocks away. We walked most places. Major plus being right across the street from Millenium Park. The only negative I can think of was parking. The night we got there the self-parking lot filled up so we had to valet park (which was expensive imo, $57/night). I know parking is just plain expensive in the loop, but $57 seemed extreme to me.

9/7/2012;6TJwmqrx0DB;TvqyhDUWrpMaqa-7x-2lHg;"I will admit it, the Hilton in downtown Chicago is not my usual go-to for accommodations in the city. It's the place that, when on vacation there I would always see it and sigh and think, when I have enough money I would love to stay there. So, this past weekend, while in town for a wedding, my fiancé and I decided to treat ourselves and get a room here. Now, let me say up front, that the entrance lobby is very impressive. And the suites that the bridal party were in were absolutely gorgeous. Even our floor and room were rather tasteful, if you like modern-chic. Also, it is very clean, as one should expect of place with such a high reputation. Hence why I gave it two stars instead of one. Now, the bad. First of all, a lot of these have to do with price. I am stating this up front because yes, we did understand that we would be paying quite a bit. Hence the whole ""we decided to treat ourselves"" bit. What I didn't know, and wish I had, was that despite the fact that you pay twice, even three times the amount on a room here compared to most places, our money only went about half, even a third as far as it does at those other places. 1) There is no included wifi. You must pay for it, and there is no wired connection option. Considering the cost of wifi or a wired connection, this seemed extremely tacky and cheap 2) No breakfast. Of any kind. You either pay the overly extravagant prices of the restaurant connected to the lobby, which is mostly a bar and dinner place to begin with, or have a coffee and breakfast at Starbucks. Not very classy for a place like the Hilton. 3) The room, despite being exorbitantly expensive, was incredibly small. We were so cramped, we had to pack our stuff away in the silly wardrobe/closet they give you, or risk several stubbed toes or possible broken bones from tripping over our weekend suitcases. (Note, these were small enough to be airplane carry-ons). 4) This size issue was also an issue in the bathroom, the shower of which was so small that if you dropped something, you would have to open the door to bend down and pick it up. 5) Yes, it was clean. In a there's-no-mold-or-bugs way, but the ceiling was dusty and full of cobwebs. 6) View. Even though this hotel is in the center of Chicago, right across Michigan Ave from the park, we got to look at a brick wall...and our neighbors. 7) Without telling us, up front, at the desk or otherwise, they overcharged our credit card to cover a per night deposit. I don't have a problem with this in principle, but it's a good thing we weren't close to our limit because not knowing that that would go on there, even temporarily, could have caused some major problems. 8) No help with parking. I know that most hotels charge for parking, especially in downtown Chicago, but several I have stayed at give a discount or some sort of thing for their guests. Or at least a price that is competitive. However, this didn't end up being a huge problem, since we just saved $20 a day by parking in the Millennium garage instead. Good thing we did too, because apparently the extra cost of parking at the Hilton didn't make your car any safer as one of our family member's had her car broken into while parked there. Basically, the hotel was rather nice. But expensive. And I don't mean in a ""you have to pay to get nice things way."" We actually got much less for our money all around than we do at our usual vacation spot (the Embassy Suites). Basically, you stay here if you have so much money you enjoy spending it unnecessarily. Your money buys you the location, and the prestige of telling cab drivers ""The Hilton, please.""";2;0;0;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Requested a wired internet room (only 30% of their rooms are capable of this - but all are WiFi enabled).  You get choices of broadband internet:  premium, advanced, basic, and hourly.  Rates per day:  $19.99, $17.99, $14.99, and $2.50 respectively.  Yes, no free internet.  Yes, it is nuts.  Forewarned is forearmed. My double/double room had 2 full bathrooms at either end of the room.  Why?  I don't know.  Reading up on the hotel, it turns out that only 300 of the 1,544 rooms have this double bathroom thing going on.  So, for you bathroom-philes, here's your personal Nirvana.  Request and enjoy.  Just for kicks, I took turns using each bathroom.  Hey, I was on vacation. The bedding and linens are upgraded with Sealy Serenity beds, high-numbered thread counts, and a good assortment of new pillows.  The bath fixtures are gold-colored so popular decades ago but functional.  My standard huge armoire had an old-school TV in it.  No in-room safe, though.  I declined the mini-bar key so if there were bundles of cash or jewelry from the Titanic in there I can't tell you. It was stuffy when I opened the door so, being a resident of the South, I knew that the first order of business was to turn on the air conditioning to the maximum setting.  When I returned from lunch two hours later, it was still unpleasant.  I called the customer care hotline:  Ann promptly answered within 2 rings, apologized when I explained the situation, and promised to dispatch maintenance immediately.  He was at my door within 5 minutes and fixed the issue within 10 minutes.  Ann called back to follow up within 5 minutes departure of the maintenance guy.  I thanked her for the prompt service and follow up.  This was a memorable part of the great service - they really do care, even if you low-balled them on Priceline. Fronting South Michigan Avenue and Grant Park, there are plenty of buses and cabs available if you want to get to other parts of the city.  The ""El"" (elevated train) is a few blocks away.  The well-designed Millennium Park, the stupendous Art Institute, and the amazing Cloud Gate sculpture (commonly called ""the Bean"") are also an easy 15-minute walk away.  Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a good value for $67 per night for even a non-traditional guy like me.";3;15;7;8;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The exterior of the hotel is just OK.

The 3 day conference was held in the Grand Ballroom for over 300 professionals in private equity, investment banking and mergers and acquisitions.   As an exhibitor/vendor at a professional conference, the main goal is to display your product or services to attract the attention of the conference attendees.  For 3 days I was at the hotel from early morning to early evening working as an exhibitor for one of my clients.  Because I am self employed, I brought my own laptop to use at the conference table.  This was to be used to show attendees the web based services that my clients had to offer.  There were over 20 exhibitors in the Grand Ballroom and many of them had laptops, lcd screens and other electronic equipment on their tables.   There was zero communication from the Hilton Chicago to inform us that we should have any concerns when leaving this equipment unattended. On the third and final day of the conference, I had my iPhone plugged into my laptop to charge and spent the morning at the table.  I had gotten up a few times to network around the room, and left the computer on the table, just as I had the previous two days.  Around 10:45am I got up to use the restroom and returned to my exhibitor table to find that in less than five minutes, my laptop and attached cell phone had been taken. I immediately reported this to security.  They were very slow in the process of questioning me and when I asked them about the security cameras, they informed me that the ONE camera they had in the Grand Ballroom does not cover the section of the room where my table was.  This piece of information alone screams DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE HILTON CHICAGO.  How can a hotel in Chicago on Michigan Ave only have one security camera in their GRAND BALLROOM?  Not smart, not secure, not safe. In most situations I would never EVER leave my belongings unattended.  In a situation where you are in a professional work environment and your equipment is being used for work, there should be a feeling of security.  A person should not have to pack up their electronic equipment every time they need to use the rest room.  After over a month of communication with the hotel security, the only resolution they had was to compensate me for less than half of what it would cost to replace the items.  Their insurance policy stated that the loss was not covered because I was not a guest of the hotel.  (any person who walks into that hotel and pays to walk into that hotel should be considered a guest) I was treated as if I was neglectful and irresponsible yet they offered to partially compensate me to shut me up?  Bad business practice in my opinion.   Unprofessional, unethical and unsecured.  Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND.";1;15;1;4;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The rooms are a bit smaller than at other Hilton locations, but very nicely appointed and comfortable, they appear to have undergone renovation recently.  Internet is $14.95 per 24 hours, which I find to be rather exorbitant, but it is very fast. This Hilton still has a single smoking floor, thank god, so smokers, book away!   The Executive Lounge on the 24th floor has a great view of Grant Park and is a comfortable place to spend some time.  The attendants are very friendly and they keep it stocked with soda (Coke!), coffee, tea, bottled water, cookies & snacks all day.  More substantial snacks are available during the Honors Reception from 5-7 each evening, but this is one of those Hiltons that actually charges for cocktails during the reception, so boo on that.  If you are a Hilton Diamond, skip the lobby and check in on the 24th floor, no lines and the concierges up there are very fast and friendly. Several restaurants on the property, including the infamous Kitty O'Sheas, Chicago's unofficial dem rallying point during election cycles and my personal favorite place to watch election returns.  Food at all the restaurants is above average for hotel fare, if a bit pricey.  I really like the prime rib sandwich at Kitty O'Sheas - quite nicely done for a hotel bar, tender and you generally get the meat cooked the way you request it. Excellent staff overall, they did an absolutely amazing job dealing with the capacity crowds on hand for Obama and maintained a friendly and helpful demeanor in the face of crazed and drunken Dems celebrating the end of our political exile.  Although the Drake is still my favorite Hilton property in the city, this is a close second and a great option if you are looking for a nice hotel in the loop.";5;4;4;3;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

And the fact that the double rooms have two bathrooms was super convenient and a really nice touch. We had one minor issue with the hotel, and it revolved around them charging us for things we didn't take from the mini-bar, but that was resolved with a quick trip to the customer service desk.

We needed a place to crash after a friend's birthday celebration. They either didn't realize when I led the field trip up to the room, or just looked the other way. In either case...cool. I have Hilton Diamond status, so they automatically upgraded me to a lake view room, which was nice. It also had two bathrooms, which was odd, but nice for all the people. The room was nice - very comfortable beds, good sized and with a nice view as well. The lobby was quite impressive, very plush, and staff were incredibly helpful. i was not able to try any of the restaurants, since I was with friends who had other (liquid) dining plans. There was also an interesting goody in the room - a $50 off coupon (with qualifying purchase) at a costume jewelery store in the lobby. I offered it to a friend, and I went down with her since I wanted to get something to munch on later. (Forget paying for the mini-bar stuff) Who do we run in to in the lobby? Fonzie. Seriously. Arthur Winkler. Nice guy, too - I have pictures to prove it. So. Between good service, very nice surroundings, a free upgrade (granted, not just spontaneous, but due to my history), and a celebrity siting, I highly recommend this hotel.

The location is ideal - close to Grant & Millenium Parks, 2 blocks from Dunkin Donuts, close to shopping and a short cab ride to Rush Street. The hotel itself is beautiful, although the rooms are dated. The biggest blow, though, was parking. $55 for valet and $45 for self. At that point I made a mental note to never complain about parking in LA ever again, and then went down the street and parked for 24 hours for about $20. What made me absolutely the happiest about our room was the fact that it had TWO bathrooms. We had a room with two double beds and TWO bathrooms. Be still, my beating heart. Also, all the hotel staff were helpful and accommodating (except with late checkout they said they'd have to charge if it were past noon.) Also, I had some sort of an allergy attack and benadryl at the gift shop was $17. Yes. $17. So I walked the half a mile to Jewel-Osco and it was all good.";4;5;0;1;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

In addition to this, I was shocked that we were charged for Internet.  We had stayed at a Comfort Inn earlier in the year and we got free Internet.  Here we were at the friggin' Hilton and we had to pay $4 an hour to use the Internet or $0.69 a MINUTE to use the system downstairs?  Ugh.  You've got to be kidding me. To make matters worse, our smoking room was to be changed to a non-smoking room the next day.  After making arrangements with the concierge, I was told that someone would be up within 15 minutes to bring me the keys to our new room.  An hour goes by and no one shows up.  I finally storm down to the desk to find out what happened and get it straightened out. The rooms weren't even that great.  They were pretty average and still had old CRT TVs.  Like I said, I expected a certain level of service from the Hilton and it just did not deliver.  If I'm paying this much for a room, I expect it to be worth it.  This was not.  Needless to say, we'll never stay in a Hilton hotel again.";1;3;1;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

They also boast that every president since FDR has walked through their doors. If it's good enough for Dr. Richard Kimble and Gerald Ford shouldn't it be good enough for you? I don't want to forget about our room completely though, after all it's the only hotel room I've had with two bathrooms and that comes in very handy when getting ready in the morning. It's just when I'm traveling the last thing I want to do is stay in the hotel room. I'd much rather be out experiencing the city or at the very least having a drink in the lobby.

I booked with Priceline for $79 (Name Your Own Price) as opposed to paying $225 per night. At $225, I'd be annoyed. At $79, I'm delighted. The staff is marginal. The front desk clerk was mildly snotty. The concierge didn't answer on my first two calls and on the third was less than helpful. Parking is $55 per night valet, and a deal (hahahahaha) for self park at $42. Drive down Wabash or park on Harrison for $19 to to $25 for 24 hours. I CANNOT STAND PARKING IN CHICAGO!!! That said, the room was surprisingly nice. I'm""m a Diamond HHonors member and the snotty desk clerk upgraded us even though she let me know that HHonors benefits did not apply to us lowly Priceline guests. We had an incredible view of the Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium as well as Lake Michigan. I like the Hilton toiletries - they smell like rosemary. There were plenty of towels and washcloths in the bathroom. The marble sink, tub and floor were nice. The wallpaper seemed dated. The furniture was decent - it looked like a knock off of the original. The bedspread seemed kind of cheap but the pillows, chairs and sheets were decent quality. I was surprised at the OLD television. No flat screens here! The air conditioning system seemed arcacic but - WOW - it did the job.   The windows actually open! The fitness center and pool were state of the art. This is the nicest pool I have seen at a Hilton property and the fitness center is huge. The lobby is a a bit of a maze and finding the reception desk required some navigation. That said, be prepared for a loooooonnnnnnngggg walk to your room. The hotel takes up an entire city block. Add the zigs and zags of and old hotel and, well, you don't have to go to the fitness center to get your exercise.  There are plenty of elevators but be sure to get on the right one.  Some go to the lower floors, some to the upper 'Executive' floors.  BTW my 'upgrade' didn't get me Executive status. Forget dining at the Hilton. Walk 3 blocks to Panera Bread or even 2 blocks to Subway for breakfast. Walk out the backdoor to the Liquor Warehouse for beer, wine or booze. This hotel is a bit too south for many dining options but if you are a walker or don't mind paying to cab it, the location is okay. For under $100 a night, I'd stay here again.";3;2;0;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The hotel itself is a giant historic Art Decoish building with impressive chandeliers and halls. Quite a landmark even though I have to remark that I have been to more inviting looking hotels (it's size makes it a bit borg-cube-like and its all dark bricks). As many hotels in historic buildings it seemed a bit dated to me furnishing wise (a lot of carpet in that place ...) and extremely dated interior-stylewise. Curtains and carpets and all the furniture are dark and kind of Empire-ish. Most people under 40 probably feel as akward entering a room like this as I did - probably a lot of people past their 40s either! Priceline made me stay in this Hilton - would not necessary have chosen this ""grand hotel"" style - helped save the budget though. Still, I had a decent stay here. Staff was friendly, especially the room maides. They asked me and my husband every morning if we had any special wishes apart from regular cleaning. We successfully ordered anti-allergic foam pillows instead of the feathery ones. Bathrooms are spacious and all marble, pretty cool. Shower, TV, Coffeemaker and everything else worked fine. As we came to explore Chicago (in which case the hotel is not at all a bad option as it is great to walk to everywhere from here) we did not spend time in any of the fitness and restaurant facilities of the hotel. Overall very ok experience to stay there but I kind of missed a real ""soul"" of the place - especially as it obviously tries to maintains this ""historic"" image. It is a kind of anonymous atmosphere probably because of the enormous size. I would give it 3.5 or even 4 if it were not for these very dark and carpeted rooms ... the style is just not very appealing to me, therefore it is only 3 stars for the Hilton.";3;1;0;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

So I was surprisingly able to use my Hilton Points to get a free room. Check in went very smooth. The room was nice and has the free coffee maker. Oddly enough, the young republicans and a republic candidate for attorney general of cook county were occupying the ballrooms. Though most of the traffic in the hotel was press and Obama supporters.

I probably came here at least three times in the past year. The first time I was working for a destination management company, and I had to show our guests where to go. I thought it was pretty easy to navigate throughout the hotel (though I suppose it does get a little confusing with some of the elevators). The second and third times, I came as a guest. The rooms were good (had a king-sized bedroom the first time, and two queen-sized beds in my room the second). I enjoyed the amenities.

Big means staff occasionally gets overwhelmed when everyone's arriving at the same time. Older means the rooms have dated (though nice) furniture and decor. Rooms are sizeable by downtown standards. Didn't try the fancy restaurants, but as for the others: The Irish pub was pretty good. The lobby bar was sloooow for table service. The executive lounge was patient with our group of 4 when we stayed there for 2 hours while meeting friends. Breakfast buffet was good and had huge selection but at an eye-watering price of around $30. For the price there are more modern hotels nearby.

11/4/2010;it5IfG8P8P5JGXSLZk;CwscaJYAfgM5CIn8oeAHuQ;"I visited Chicago in August 2010 for the annual Market Days event in the Boy's Town district of Chicago. I was able to secure a deal on this hotel through undisclosed means, and we chose the hotel based on the history, beauty, and location of it in proximity to Michigan Avenue. We were set to arrive quite late on a Friday night. I had called earlier in the evening to inform them that I would be arriving late, but not to give away my room, as I had the reservations made in advance. I was informed that this would not be a problem. When we arrived in Chicago, the hotel's attached parking ramp seemed rather hard to find. Though this is to be expected, a head's up: parking was $43 for self and $55 valet. Before you complain, remember you are in downtown Chicago. Stay somewhere else if you don't want to pay for parking. I was immediately impressed with the gorgeous lobby area and entry area to the hotel. Anyone who can appreciate historic buildings will love this hotel. Given the lateness of our arrival, there was not much of a line, and only a few individuals working the desk, which I expected. However, I was rather dismayed to find out that the only room they had left available (I had booked a room with two queen-sized beds) was a ""parlor,"" which is simply a living room area attached to a larger suite. It has it's own bar area, TV, desk, computer, and bathroom, but only a pull-out sofa bed. It was only for one night and we were very tired. Knowing that these things happen, I grabbed the keys. I was, however, disappointed that this happened given I had called several hours prior to avoid this very thing. The parlor was more than adequate for a few people, but if I were to have had a party of 4 or more, I may have been more upset. It did slightly bother me they didn't offer any form of ""apology"" or incentive to make me feel welcome. It almost felt like a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" situation, and did not make me feel very valued. I appreciated that taxis were always available on the Michigan Avenue entrance of the hotel (consequently one of the most beautiful parts of the lobby as well). As a full-service hotel in a downtown metro, it annoys me when people complain about the nickling and diming. Yes, there is a charge for the internet, fitness center, breakfast, and items in the room. This is to be expected, and I will not knock the hotel, as it was my decision to stay here. Other reviewers would be wise to remember that. You're not getting a free buffet for your family of six at this hotel. The next day, we switched rooms to a room with two queen beds and two bathrooms (which I VERY much appreciated the next morning). The only complaint I can make about the rooms are that the windowsills had a lot of dead bugs on them, and notes advising guests to be cautious of opening the windows, lest bugs get in. Advice was noted and well-taken. The beds were nothing outstanding, surprisingly, as I do prefer a softer bed. The bathrooms had very nice gold accents and everything in the room was very well cleaned/appointed. However, when we were in the process of switching rooms, there was a VERY long line of guests, and it took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of it. I was shocked to see only two people working on a Saturday morning during Lollapalooza, which was across the street. They definitely needed more staffing both mornings I was downstairs. In summary, there are a lot of great things about this hotel. It is very historic, well maintained, and I felt a lot richer than I was staying in it. The rooms were nicely appointed and the location was great (though it's still a few blocks away from the shopping areas of Michigan Avenue). I can say, however, that I would not pay to stay here unless I were to get a good deal again, as the service, while not terrible, was very flat and apathetic. The desk agents, regardless of the time of day or night, sounded bored, uninterested, and I got a very unapproachable vibe from many of them, though they were never downright rude to me. Perhaps this is because they are trained to be ""professional"". A little smiling never hurt anyone. The Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location that is simply hampered by a few rough edges. From my experience, my only complaints were being stuck in a parlor room when I was guaranteed a two queen-bed guest room and the flat service from the employees (perhaps the biggest turn off for me). I suspect that if I wanted to be obnoxious, I could've mentioned my complaints to the desk and I have may have received some sort of compensation, though I am not that kind of person and nothing about the stay (except the room issue) even remotely seemed to warrant that kind of complaining. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really consider these minor issues to be indicative of a poor hotel. We had no issues with the cleanliness or noise, and I would stay here again, though I'd make sure I found a better deal than rack rate.";3;0;0;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Great place to stay for a short trip to Chicago.  It is positioned right next to the park and art museum.  Within reasonable walking distance of most of the major downtown attractions.  I recommend taking a cab or the bus up to the top of the mile and walking it down, then grab a quick cab back and its worth the expense.  Especially if you go when Chicago is cold.... which is practically always!   The rooms are what you need them to be.  They are comfy, modern, and clean.  Spoil yourself and go downstairs for the breakfast buffet.  Just have them charge it to the room so you don't feel so guilty about it.   Flat screen tv in the room, ours was prob a 40 inch, maybe 45.  PC screen has free applications to cater to tourist needs and give you ideas if you run out of things to do.   BE ADVISED!  If you are taking a trip to Chicago...

Valet, Front Desk, Concierge and Housekeeping staff were always friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a parlor suite that overlooked Grant Park- it was rather large and spacious. There were double doors that led to our suite. Upon entering one will note the bathroom on the left, walking a few more steps one will note the living room on the right with a large sofa, large comfy chair, coffee table and huge wet bar. The wet bar was full sized (with a sink and small fridge) something you would expect to see in someone's home. In the middle of the room was a large dresser with a huge television, built in the middle of the large dresser was a fridge w/ the hotel mini bar. On the left was our King bed and a few steps away from our bed was a large desk. Our room was rather larger. There were two heaters- one in our bedroom and the other in our sitting room. From our suite there were breathtakingly beautiful views of Grant Park and the Lake, everything was covered in a blanket of snow. They also had a cutesy gingerbread house not far from the Grand Ball room. Absolutely gorgeous Christmas Tree and other floral decorations throughout the hotel. RESTAURANT Upon our arrival we ordered room service. Apparently the menu we had in our room was old. We ordered burgers with blue cheese and dessert- apple tart and chocolate cake. The food came in a reasonable amount of time. I noticed our chocolate cake was not on our tray. When bringing this to the server's attention he said- ""No, you did not order chocolate cake."" My better half asked him to look at our ticket and low and behold we did order the chocolate cake. The server said sorry and left to get our cake. It took forever for the chocolate cake to arrive. Upon closer inspection of the apple tart- we noticed the tart portion was uncooked. We sent the apple tart back and ordered the apple pie. The apple pie was dropped off quickly. Upon careful inspection we noticed more than half the crust of the apple pie was missing. So we sent back the apple pie. They really did a mess-up job on the desserts. The customer service was lacking. We called room service to speak with a manager and the person who answered the phone said we were not allowed to speak to the manager. That is when we decided to call the front desk and speak with the general manager on duty. The GM took comped the entire dinner and was sorry for the problems we encountered. We decided to no longer order from room service. GIFT SHOP, ETC Medium sized filled with things that a traveler might forget to pack- floss, nail clippers, nail polish remover. They have a good selection of gifts that sport the name ""Chicago"". Customer service was friendly. They also have a FedEx located in the hotel.

The pool is great and you can do the spa thing or work out. There is also a whirl pool, but it is often full of kids on the weekends. I may be foolish to spend money on a hotel when I live in the neigborhood, but I find it essential to get away. For the ""Taste Of Chicago"" it is a convineience and for guest it is a safe place. The handicapped rooms are great for your parents if they have any available. The food is OK and expensive, but such is life in downtown hotels.

3/8/2008;OcCg2D;9Aiu_2nzNJkxHAmx4Tfkww;"I stayed here in mid-February 2008 for 6 nights and was mildly satisfied with my stay.  There were some really nice aspects of the hotel counterbalanced by some major flaws which can result in an average rating at best. To start with the pros.... Hotel was very cheap (approx $100 a night).  Granted, it was the off season but this rate was considerably cheaper than many other Chicago hotels in the same class.  The Hilton was also very clean, fairly upscale and in a great location. Now onto the negatives.... First and foremost, the room was EXTREMELY dry.  The Tunisian Desert would seem humid compared to our room.  Every morning began with an extremely dry throat and feelings of impending nosebleeds.  I drank more fluids than a marathoner running in Hell.  We called maintenance to check out the heating system but they were not able to do anything to correct the situation.  We eventually ended up sleeping with the heat off, windows open and water filling every container in the room (ice bucket, all the cups, sink, bathtub.... etc). The second major problem was with the housekeeping staff.  They do an excellent job cleaning the rooms and keeping the hotel in great shape but they can be a major annoyance.  Every morning (even on Sunday), we were awoken by knocks from housekeeping before 10:30 AM.  There were privacy dials on the doors instead of the standard ""Do Not Disturb"" signs but the housekeeping staff obviously pays no attention to these at all.  Even better was the constant peddling of coffee... On several mornings, we had knocks on the door to ask if we needed coffee.  Again, the privacy knob was turned and we did not call for the coffee.  By the end of the stay, we had a growing stack of coffee packages which we never touched. If it was not for these few major flaws, I could see giving this hotel a 4.5 out of 5 but the way things stand, a feel that a 2 star rating is generous.";2;0;0;0;N;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1/16/2011;nxrDO38Ek-kxlt94TA6AIw;OWtUxL-kR4oUxfM6qnDh-Q;"(Just to preface this, I registered for Yelp just to write this review) We arrived at Victor Hotel shortly after doors opened (around 9:15 - 9:30pm) for their NYE party. There was a good sized line outside, but it couldn't have been more than 100 or so actually outside. We assumed we'd be in line for about 20 - 30 minutes top before we'd get in. Boy, were we wrong. We spent the first 20 minutes in line, only to find out that we actually had to pick up our tickets from another gentleman towards the front of the line. So we got out of line, made our way to the front, got our tickets, and got back in line towards the back. Some time passes and now it's about 10:30pm, and those of us in line are now becoming impatient. We've been in line for over an hour now, and the line doesn't seem to be moving. Finally, one of the gentleman managing the line informs us Victor Hotel will refund our tickets if we decide to leave and bring our tickets back the next day. I was willing to do this but our group had already spent quite a bit of time and money getting there (I'd spent $20 on cab fare just to get there and would have to do the same thing if I decided to come back for a refund the next day), so our group decided to wait it out in hopes we'd get in soon and start to enjoy our night. It began to rain...but we still waited it out since one of the employees informed us we'd be in within 15 - 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were finally in getting our coats checked. It's 11:00pm by now. I learned that they had one single person giving out tickets for coat check, and maybe another couple people actually hanging coats. That's right, for the hundreds and hundreds of people in attendance, they had only a few people managing the coat check process which was easily the biggest reason for the slow moving line. We make it into the main part of the club only to find a sea of people we'd have to wade through to get a drink. We found a small spot and decided to park it there and try to get drinks. That didn't happen. We waited another half hour before my girlfriend and I decided we'd had enough. We left at 11:30pm, after waiting in line for over an hour in the rain, waiting for a single drink another half hour, never receiving a single refreshment. We raced home in a cab hoping to get to Dominick's before it closed in order to get drink we had sought after the whole night. I got out of Dominick's at 11:59pm, just in time to celebrate the New Years with my girlfriend. We kissed in the parking lot of Dominick's, watching the fireworks being set off in the distance. Although not ideal, I was at least with the person I wanted to be with that night. ---- Here comes part 2. I thought I was done dealing with these folks, but I was wrong. I started receiving text messages from these guys a couple weeks later telling me to come back for specials. Needless to say, I was infuriated. I hadn't opted into any SMS communications, not to mention the messages they sent didn't include any instructions for opting out of this marketing bullshit. I searched around and found the service they were using to send out these messages (http://texthub.com/) and found the tiny little link in their footer allowed you to opt out of their messages. To be frank, this type of communication is illegal (as I did not opt-in knowingly) and they provided no method for unsubscribing to the messages via SMS (as outlined by the CAN-SPAM act). Stay away from this place. At all costs. Far away.";1;10;3;4;N;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1/6/2011;cd3rpvMPR1vz98cjIYaQxw;nDecuGTnqDgVpH1zUyP8EQ;"I kept trying to reassure myself that this place wouldn't be as bad as the reviews here made it to be, especially since we were paying for a ticket and it should be fairly exclusive, right? Wow, Yelp, you were sooooo right and I swear to never doubt you again. THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE (and yes, I am breaking internet etiquette to express this statement!) Spent almost $75 a person just to wait. Jokingly we said the club should be called ""The Line"" but honestly, we waited for almost every freaking thing we didn't even want to do anymore. We had an amazing dinner at Thalia Spice (which we also did last year because it was just THAT good), then got to the club around 10pm, thinking most of the line should be gone. Instead, we arrive to find not only is the general admission still waiting, but even the idiots who decided dropping $100s of dollars for VIP was a good idea were still outside. What was even better was their ""so-called"" tickets were business cards with little numbers written on the top - why did I pay so much money for your stupid business card when I could have just taken one, then write scribble on a corner like a third of the people that got in for free? We waited in line for 45 minutes even though we purchased tickets ahead of time. When people started complaining, throwing fits, and demanding refunds, suddenly the line was moving faster... Shocker. It moved so fast we had to then wait in line for drinks for at least 20 minutes (not necessarily a line, but more like a mass of bodies around the only two bars in the entire place). Brilliant idea to put only three bartenders at the larger bar on a night like NYE and one bartender at the bar near the bathroom, which of course smelled like a cess pool. I get that it's an open bar and the bartender really wants tips but it got ridiculous when the bartender only paid attention to people who flashed $20s and titties. Not necessarily in that order, either. No real surprise when people would order six drinks a round for only their consumption when finally given the attention. I myself ordered 4 Coronas for my wasted time. Then, time to climb over more bodies and oh yeah, did I mention the broken glass that littered the floor? I never saw a single staff member moving to clean it up. Nor any puke that random drunk girls decided to produce on the dance floor. Or even the guy that admitted to me in his drunken stupor that he pissed on the main bar because the bathroom was too gross to enter. How magical. So midnight toast, fine - that was well and dandy other than the fact that we didn't get our party favorites or champagne as was to be included in our price (never saw the appetizer that was supposed to be included either, but at that point, nothing surprised me about this crappy place); thankfully people started to leave after the ball dropped. People falling all over themselves, the music was decent at best, and then the DJ or some distant voice in the crowd announces it's last call at 1:30... at 1:32, two whole minutes later, the house lights come on and that same distant voice says the club was closing. Wow, I'm pretty sure the advertisement stated the club would close at 2am. I know I'm not drunk because I never made it back to the bar after hearing about urine possibly being under my shoes. So yet the final line for the coat check. A girl friend of mine was shoved while we waited by some drunken idiot, so she started to shove back just to defend herself. Suddenly, she's getting fondled by security and thrown out of the club while her sister is desperately trying to prevent her from being hurt by testosterone-driven perverts. They literally picked her up by her legs and held her in parts they should not have been touching. Fast-forward to her waiting out in the cold without her jacket because they won't let her back in and guess what I discover? Bleeding scratch marks all over her exposed back. She's too disoriented and intoxicated to care, but her sister is furious and blind with anger. The females of our party were frustrated and completely disappointed with the night, while the males of our party were inebriated and thought it was a riot just to see women fight, even if it was their own friends. Absolutely horrible for NYE. By the way, one of the females will also be writing the General Manager and I am urging my friend who was injured to look into charges, if possible.

This isn't the place to go if you just want to grab a few drinks with your friends... but is if you want to come out, meet a few people, and have a decent conversation.  The crowd was very diverse (big plus) and friendly (def a good thing).   Will probably go back next week is something is going on.

The music on the nights which I have been has been spotty, sometimes hip and funky, other times latin influenced and there were a couple people breaking down the salsa on the dancefloor.

Second, I've been there both Fridays and Saturdays and they seem to have a good selection of DJ's that DJ there on a regular basis. The ceiling in the main room is pretty high so the sound obviously is amplified there but the music selection is great so who cares. Plus, it's a bar so it's supposed to be loud? Third, their bartenders, both female and male, are attractive which I consider to be a huge plus and a draw. Who doesn't need eye candy when they go out to bars?

I even came to the club the night before to pick up my tickets so I could avoid the line. It wasn't until some guests waiting in line complained to Cameron that we were finally moved inside. Once inside, we ended up waiting in another long line for the bar, which took at least 45 minutes to get drinks. It was ridiculous to see one bartender on the side bar and three bartenders at the main bar serving over 700 people. The club was extremely crowded; there was hardly any space to move. Numerous times I shoved violently by other guests at the club; My fiancé was worried for my safety. The floor was wet and had assorted broken bottles and glasses on the floor. I understand it is New Year's eve and the place can get crowded. What added to the  disappointment was the number of people talking about getting in the club without buying tickets. I saw Cameron at the door handing out tickets without checking a list of people who had purchased them. I spent $150 for a set of tickets expecting to get according to your advertisement: ""complimentary passed hors d'oeuvres and appetizers...a midnight champagne toast...party favors and noise makers"".

1/26/2011;KIJsx;vcMAXt0wk_qEpekjHX2SGA;"Some of my friends had gone to this place a couple of weeks ago to celebrate a birthday. They apparently had a good time, so when my bff asked me how this club was, I told her (based on my friends reviews) that it sounded like it was a fun club. Boy was I wrong! We went to celebrate my bff sister's birthday, on Saturday. We got there with another gf around 10:45. Parking was kind of difficult to find and valet was $12. Its a very shady neighborhood, full of warehouses and factories. The place is actually behind a meat packing place that my step-brother use to co-own and I worked there a summer when I was younger to earn a little bit of money. I was kind of surprised by the location of this ""club"". It looked like a place where you could be mugged or killed your body thrown in a dump or the river and you would never be heard from again! So we find parking about a block away walk there and there's a line waiting to get in, I assume there where about 20 people in front of us waiting to get in. It was freezing outside and there was ice on the sidewalk. I mean if the club managers know there's going to be girls going who are wearing heels. Wouldn't the smart thing be to throw some salt to melt the ice to prevent injury!? So were waiting, and waiting and waiting and the line moves about an inch. We continue waiting and waiting and waiting...Meanwhile our toes are beginning to hurt from the cold. Finally we make it just inside this little un-heated tent they had out there, at least the cold air won't hit us. We continue to wait and wait and wait.... In the meantime there's groups of people who just go talk to the bouncer and get in. That's fine we figure they probably bought one of they're expensive, watered down bottles. After half an hour of waiting and our toes freezing off, we start to question if this place will really be worth it. We contemplate leaving, but decide not to since we already waited this long. Half an hour later the bouncer decides only women can get in, we where the first ones behind a group of guys. So we finally get in, only to find we HAVE to check our coats in. which causes us to wait again because the coat check room is right by the entrance. Were inside its now about 11:45 and the place is half empty and there's more girls than guys standing around! Wth! why where they keeping us out in the freezing Chicago weather? Why did they only, eventually only let girls inside? And why was this place so freaking small!? I thought there would be a lower or upper level!? Its basically the main ""dance"" floor where the bar is on one side and tables and chairs on the other. And two smaller rooms, I guess for parties. But then again what did I expect if this place is behind a freaking meat packing factory!!! We left after about twenty minutes and 2 drinks later to find a place where we could really dance(La Pachanga) The only good thing was we didn't pay a cover because my friend forwarded me that get-in-the-club-free txt. Will NEVER be going to this place again!!!";1;2;0;0;N;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

We would have held our wedding reception at the James because we liked the design of venue's event room, but it was not big enough for the amount of guests attending our wedding. The weekend of our wedding was chaotic due to Chicago hitting record high temperature levels and causing havoc on the hotel's air conditioners. While there were moments of stress, significant praise is warranted for the special events director Sinisa and the head concierge Krista - always keeping their cool and ensuring that all of our guests received excellent service (including moving them to rooms with functioning a/c, and if this was not possible comping rooms at comparable hotels in the Magnificent Mile area). The guest rooms are the size you would expect for downtown chicago and the bed and finishings was extremely comfortable (we are in process of purchasing one for our new home). The amenities were amazing and we found the modern bathroom to be near spa quality.  We had a suite on our wedding night and it was very spacious and well designed.   The breakfast catering was superb and the service was top-notch.  They were kind enough to let us serve leftover items from our dessert buffet at the wedding reception.   Overall, the James proved to not only be a great hotel for a vacation stay, but also held up to the high-stress of a wedding and Chicago summer heat to provide our guests with a great experience.  We would definitely recommend the James to anyone looking for a luxurious getaway in the city or a special event.";5;0;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Oh and did I mention a 2pm checkout?  Yes that's right my friends no waking up early to pack up your crap you spread all over the room to make sure you are out by 11 or 12.  Relax.  Grab a mimosa at brunch and enjoy your last day.

I woke up at 7AM to the shower noise upstairs which sounded like a giant sprinkler system. I ended up closing my bathroom door to muffle some of the sound. Woke up at again around 9AM after a family was talking outside my door. Woke up again around 10AM to someone shuffling plastic bags. Sigh. Bring ear plugs. Just walking down the hall you can also hear people in the room talking. The doors might as well be made out of paper. Not no great things about the hotel: - soundproofing - 2 tiny elevators. Each can fit 6 people like sardines or 2-3 people with luggage. Staying on the 5th floor, I ended up taking the stairs for most of the trip - stairs are located on the 2nd floor. - the Audi car service is never able when you need it. For a 2 mile radius of travel, I can probably walk the distance in the time I'm waiting for the car. - toilet paper was a little over a full arm lengths away at an awkward distance. I ended up taking it off of its holder and putting it on the bath tub instead. - TV's sound goes in and out every now and then And the great: + Check out is at 2PM!! + good location near Michigan Ave, Trader Joes across the street, Walgreens another block down, and a small movie theater a block away. Then again, there are other hotels to choose from in this area too like Four Points by Sheraton across the street. + nice spacious one bedroom apts + nice shampoo and conditioner that makes lots of promises like non frizzy, volumizing, moisturizing, color protection, gluten free, etc + free wifi + brownie and cookie treats for turn-down service. + free water in the bedroom which is basically filtered tap water. I can't get over the taste of tap water in Chicago, but with a lot of ice it tastes great. There's a ice machine on the 4th floor. + comfortable couch + soft bed that just eats you up. I have to add another star JUST for the bed. Otherwise I would rate the James hotel 3 stars.. but after I stayed the following week at a Hyatt, then a Marriott, then at home, I HAVE to agree that James hotel has the most comfortable bed of all hotels. All-in-all, not bad, but I don't think I'll be back. I don't want to deal with the small elevator and the thin doors/walls.

This place felt like a hotel that thinks it's all that, but in practice stinks like a wet fart.  We arrived promptly to check-in, and were told that we would have to wait for up to 2 hours before our room would be ready.  This was pretty inconvenient given the fact that we had solid plans for that evening already (dinner, concert) and really screwed up our evening mojo.  When we relayed our distaste over the delay to the concierge or whatever you call it, they offered no kind of consolation (free parking, etc.) other than 2 free drink tickets at their hotel bar.  We didn't have time to enjoy the drink because of our rush at this point. After returning from our otherwise excellent evening, we went back up to our room.  It's got this very funky design which was kinda cool, but the carpeting is this super thick red/maroon stuff that looks like it's just rife with problems that only a blacklight would reveal. The bed was pretty comfortable, minus the fact that it didn't even have a proper fitted sheet.  That's right, they just placed a sheet over the mattress, probably thinking, ""this won't be a problem as long as they don't move at all while they sleep"".  On top of that, the comforter was given the appearance of a duvet cover by sandwiching it between 2 plain sheets.  Did somebody forget to do the laundry or something? Ah, this would be a good time to mention that when we arrived back to the hotel from our evening out, we wanted to use our handy-dandy free drink tickets.  To our dismay, the bar was CLOSED.  At 11:30.  On a SATURDAY.  In CHICAGO.  Seriously? Anyway, long story short, my wife raised a s**tstorm the following morning about all this business and they covered our breakfast in the hotel restaurant - which was pretty good.  Other than that single redeeming factor, I was pretty disappointed with the entire experience.  I won't be back.";2;2;0;3;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1/2/2012;rlpXtHBftnrX7UGPC0U7OA;BsCPTtZGFC_zbawqxqP37Q;"Our stay at The James was great! It's a smaller hotel than I'm used to staying in, but it was fantastic. The room was a nice size. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in away from home. Very clean. Very quiet. Great customer service. If we needed new towels, they were rushed up. Every night they have turn down service where they offered to turn down your bed, get you ice, and they bring you cookies. Only a few negative things during our 3 night stay: The room service was pretty average, but expensive per usual. The valet parking was $48 a day which is nuts!! We were on the top floor, and our room was always crazy hot. We had to have the thermostat at 55 degrees so that we wouldn't sweat. The whole place only has 2 elevators, and at 2am after all the New Years parties were coming to an end we came back to the hotel to find a HUGE line to get in an elevator.   All-in-all, I'd stay here again.";4;1;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Or else, the staff is professional and efficient. Modern and minimalist decor throughout the hotel is calming. The bed is super comfy.

We were checked into room 604, which my mother wasn't too happy about since she was afraid we would be disturbed in our sleep from traffic below - but we had nothing to worry about, since we slept comfortably all 4 nights, without hearing a single peep from outside (or the hallways).  The only noticeable sounds you might hear are from next door when they're taking a shower - and you only hear that if you're in the bathroom. I didn't have a problem with the tiny elevators, but they could be a little bit bigger and faster.  Our room (I say ""our"" because we noticed some rooms were bigger/smaller than others when we took a peek during turn-down service) was big enough for 3, minimal, simple, and modern, just like the rest of the hotel.  The bathroom was a bit small, but who cares?  'Cause the best part?  The James is amazingly, fantastically, awesomely CLEAN.  I've stayed in enough hotels to know that sometimes the maids get super lazy and don't give a shit about keeping the rooms clean.  But the housekeeping and turn-down service (delicious cookies every night!) at The James is top-notch. Since The James is a boutique hotel, the employees (specifically the doormen) recognized us and often greeted us by our names - which was very impressive.  There's a Trader Joe's across the street on one side, which is super convenient if you want to grab a quick snack, lunch, and/or dinner.  There are plenty of other restaurants near by such as Grand Lux Cafe (across the street), if you want something a bit more formal.  There's also a Marshall's, which came in super handy for us because by the third day, my mother wanted a pair of sneakers 'cause her feet were so tired from walking in heels.  And when it rained?  Marshall's was crowded 'cause everyone was trying to purchase an umbrella!  The James is also just a short block away from the Mag Mile. Again, The James is truly and easily one of the best hotels I've ever come across and I would definitely stay here again, no doubt about that.";5;7;6;3;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

My room was interior facing.  This was not an issue frankly because in this neighborhood a 16 story  building is going to have a view of... well other buildings.  So nothing missed out on with the view and I had a room that was quite spacious.  The bed was uber-comfortable and the bath carried forward the hotel's modern style.   The service from the staff from the front desk to the bellmen was excellent.  Whether it was directions, restaurant tips, getting me to Wrigley Field, not only did they take care of me, but the followed up afterwards.  Great staff! Last tip, I scored a great deal on the room through American Express.  I was going to use points and money to pay, but the rate was so good, I saved the points and just paid for room.";5;0;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

We really couldn't complain though. Flat panel televisions both in the living room and bedroom, and the most well stocked bar....yes, bar and not minibar....I have ever seen.

7/2/2011;Gc9gqnGHpZWpuUixpsFY;jtMy0WC-3lnL4LLJC1Ebgg;"I booked this hotel through Hotwire. This is my very first boutique hotel and quite honestly I don't know what to expect since I usually book hotels that are more well known or is part of a big hotel chain company.   Stayed only overnight but all I can say is.. WOWZERS. The James Hotel doesn't look that enticing from the outside; The hotel lobby isn't even that big or expensive looking..but don't let that fool you because what makes this hotel top notch is the quality of their service. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were instantly greeted by 2 staff. We came a bit early (about 9:20 am) hoping that we can leave some of our items since we had to go to Wrigley field to watch a game around 1pm. We didnt checked in yet but they accomodated our needs without any problems. While watching  batting practice, I received a call ( around 11-12pm) from one of their staff letting us know that our room is ready. (Checked in time is at 2:00 pm) So nice of them to contact us even if its not necessary, very caring and professional indeed. We got a double bed room. Love the sleek-ness and simplicity of the room, very modern and clean looking. The bed is just heaven... one of the best hotel beds ever. LOVE the bathroom products.. Kiehls products? YES PLEASE! Very lavish! Love the grapefruit lotion.. I don't usually hoard hotel items but I am this time! We also got 2 bathrobes with slippers.. not every big time hotels offer this, not even 5 star hotels will have this ready for you unless you asked for it. That night, my sister and I wanted to go out to eat but the weather didnt want to cooperate with us anymore, so we have no choice but to stay at the hotel and just try room service. I've had several room service at 5 star hotels but I got to say, this is possibly the best one I've ever had no joke. The food is absolutely delicious! Food is served from David Burke's Primehouse. I got a Classic filet mignon with mushrooms and basil whipped potatos... sooo freakin good. I forgot what my sister got but all I can remember is that her asiago truffled fries is ridiculous! I never thought room service dining would be this good. I wished our food came with a rolling tray instead, but I can't complain much about it. After our dinner someone knocked on our door and saw it was one of the housekeeping ladies. She was probably there for a turn down service but nonetheless, she still gave us cookies! Yay! :D Another thing that I absolutely like about this hotel, and this may not be matter for most people, is that the check-out time is around 2 p.m. YES, same time as check in and out.. FINALLY a hotel that have you stay for a full 24 hours! I just don't like hotels tryna get rid of you by 12 noon.. seriously.. I'm not a morning person, so that was an issue for me lol. One downside to this hotel though and I hate to say it is that the view is just horrible. We have a view of a old building with a scary looking dark alley on street view, feel like zombies are going to come out at night or something. Other than that everything is faboulous! I would love to go back here again, very pleased that I got this hotel!";5;0;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

After one day on my four day trip, I have to say that this is the best hotel at which I've stayed in Chicago. I'd heard about The James for a long time and as I'm a boutique hotel whore, I couldn't wait to check it out. And I wasn't disappointed. Well, let me modify that...I wasn't impressed with the decor, but what can you expect from an older (I can't believe 5 years is older in this category) boutique hotel. What I have really appreciated is the smaller touches. Keihl's (sp?) products, personalized, handwritten notes upon arrival, uber-friendly staff, great down pillow and crisp sheets, and loads of towels. I really can't find anything to complain about, except for that I'd love it if they offered a ""sleep' function on the remote control (can't fall asleep when I'm traveling and need background noise.) -- and they actually may offer that but I've been too slow to figure it out. I wouldn't be surprised if I up this to 5 stars by the end of my stay...esp bc of the price.... Wait and see...";4;5;3;2;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

The cute little thing also came in a discreet carrying case, replete with a condom, mini bottle of lube, and the appropriately sized batteries. !!! We giggled uncontrollably, of course, and then promptly called the front desk and ordered eight more, one for each of the ladies in our office.  They brought them up that evening in a nice little gift bag, perfect for my friend to carry back on the plane with her. Honestly, the room could have smelled like sewage at this point and I still would have given the hotel a top rating.  It's these special little touches that are really so important.";5;3;2;4;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

9/13/2010;bCHyuHStzUKU8YjreZob8A;LSXeAhq3r0XXA6CT4ysc5A;"5 billion stars for The James as my wedding venue. The James was an awesome venue.  It isn't your typical wedding venue with pastels and white linens and chair covers with bows and ribbons everywhere, it is more contemporary and has a modern, stylistic feel.  This is what my fiance and I wanted for our wedding, so the James was a perfect fit.  We were sold as soon as we saw the reception space which has lighting included (adds to the drama) and an incredible black and white mural of the Chicago skyline.  The food was incredible, too.  Many of our guests said that they'd never had a better meal at a wedding.  Receptions at the James are catered by David Burke's Prime, so the food is pretty spectacular (esp the filet mignon).  The cost was suprisingly reasonable for the fantastic quality and venue, especially when compared to other hotels in the area. The professionalism was great, I had pretty specific requests for how the room was to be set up, etc., and Sinisa and his team executed everything perfectly.  Before guests entered the reception dinner area, Sinisa took me, my husband, and my parents into the room so we could see how it loooked and it was dramatic and fantastic (very David Tutera-ish).  It was a nice touch.  The tasting was amazing, too.  We were treated very VIP-ish throughout the experience.  Responsiveness through email can be a little slow.  However, during the 1-3 weeks leading up to the wedding, responsiveness was right on point.  Email returns were within a few hours.  I suppose these are the most crucial times for communication, so that was greatly appreciated and all in all they did a great job coordinating and setting up/breaking down the event. Awesome things about The James as a wedding venue: (1) The food is AMAZING (2) The price was way lower than other hotels in the area (3) The absence of the typical hotel wedding feel (i.e. white poufy linens and pastel chair covers & bows everywhere...blech) (4) The James Club for an after party (seriously, this was pretty awesome and I loved that you can have late-night snacks there and play pool) (5) VIP feel of the overall experience (6) free upgrade to a pimped-out suite for the bride or another guest of choice (7) dramatic pinpoint lighting included....lighting is way expensive if you bring it in yourself, and having the lighting really added something extra All in all, an amazing, fantastic venue that was a pleasure to work with.  I definitely recommend The James to other brides in the future!  I wish I had another wedding to plan so I could work with them again!";5;4;2;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1/8/2009;lok4yU8L8mPOsh;QF0hpq8epb5aNV6R7LNEtQ;"I stayed here for a night and had a terrific experience. Upon arriving, the doorman and bellhop immediately made us feel like we were in store for something special.  They were friendly, talkative, and didn't try and rush us out of traffic.  Our car was whisked away and we were 'welcomed to the James'.  Valet:  Free in and out privileges - although we walked and cabbed it everywhere that weekend. The lobby is modern yet calm.  (Turned into a hopping night spot later on.)  There were problems when we were checking in.  We didn't know if our room was under my boyfriend's name, the promoter's name, or his agent's name.  The girl working the front desk was very patient with us and we got to the bottom of it.  Whoo HOO!  Free room upgrade because 'ours' wasn't ready yet.  I don't quite get that, but I'm not complaining. Side note: I love the luggage display by the elevators.   The rooms are fairly minimal but extremely comfortable.  We had a problem with the shower drain not draining.  Called the front desk.  POOF! Someone knocked on the door about 5 minutes later, did his business (not THAT business), and our shower was fixed. Bonus stars for the Kiehls bath products! We were suppose to go for dinner with the group, but everyone else had jet-lag.  Dinner cancelled.  We opted for room service.  Why leave the quiet luxury of this room if we didn't have to? I got the cob salad.  YUM!  And HUGE.  We could have split it.  Room service delivered quickly - food came about 20 minutes after we called.  I  didn't even have time to realize that they had forgotten our 2 ice waters when POOF! again.  Someone knocking at the door. After a long night out, it was a welcome treat to return to my little abode.   And HOORAY for late check out!  We lazed around in our bed fit for a king, ordered more room service, and left around 4PM.

The bed was very comfy and The James knows that three pillows are not too many.  Oddly, though, I found the sheets to be rough and actually caused sores on my elbows. Bathroom was spotless everyday.  But the toilet lid would not stay up.  This can make for some awkward experiences.  The James supplies Kiehl's bath products.  I kept taking them and they kept replenishing.  Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.  I'm going to give them as Christmas gifts I have so many of them. Nice touches include original art in the room and fun books to peruse.  Bathrobes and slippers included.  Free internet in the lobby if you're not traveling with your laptop.   The location is great.  Two blocks from the Mile and about four blocks from the red line.  Plenty of good eats in the 'hood, too.

9/6/2011;1NKwWcricx4zJ48;8Aqr35f254lOeitNowt7ig;"So I just got married. Here. This weekend. Yup. I don't even want to tell you about it. I want to be selfish and keep all the memories to myself and think that no one else could POSSIBLY have as an amazing time as we did at The James. GAH--okay. I will tell you. Because I want all you brides-to-be out there to think outside the box. To let you know that you don't have to get married at some hoity-toity, over-the-top, been-there, done-that hotel downtown where they are going to offer you nothing but the same-old same-old. The James offered a wedding venue that was utterly and completely refreshing. First of all, the Great Room is a fantastically versatile space. We held our ceremony AND reception in it, and were able to manipulate the space to make it look completely and totally different for both events within the same evening. How? you may ask. Wellll....there are a couple things. First, they have skylights and pinspot lighting in the room--we opened the skylights for a more natural ceremony, but used the pinspots for a more elegant, warm reception. And this is big: the main wall of the room is covered by a large (now a dark, burnt orange) velvet curtain, and underneath lies a huge etched mural of the Chicago skyline and lakefront. Using the curtain for our ceremony allowed for a more solemn moment (as weddings are SERIOUS, ya'll) but the mural changed the feeling of the room completely for the reception, reminding you of the fun, modern space you were in. And the colors in the room are mostly neutral, allowing any gal set on magenta and chartreuse to not have her heart broken. Second--THE STAFF. Sinisa, the event coordinator for The James, is possibly the nicest man in the business I have ever met. He is so calm, so accommodating, and honestly, you feel like you've made a friend by the end of all the planning nonsense. The service staff were flawless, and the management were flexible and even friendly about it when we got behind schedule. Third--THE FOOD. C'mon people. Did you really think David Burke's Primehouse would do the catering?!? Um. Well. THEY DO. They will take your order (from the predetermined menu) at the table, and deliver the perfect steak/fish/veggie risotto to you JUST like you'd order in their amazing restaurant downstairs. COME ON. This is no joke. Other fantastical perks? The rooms, the concierge, The James Club for an afterparty (great space, too! We used the pool table for ping pong), and um. Well. Everything else you could possibly think of to be incredible when you're marrying the love of your life. I can't count how many people told us that our wedding was the absolute best they'd ever been to. I'd consider myself lucky, but...The James definitely had something to do with that.";5;7;4;5;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

I'd paid for a regular room that was designed to accommodate three people in separate beds (two doubles and a rollaway). When I arrived to check in, they told me that my room would not accommodate three people in three bed, but no problem -- they'd upgrade me to an apartment room. Woo hoo! I was even given a complimentary drink from the Primehouse menu while I waited for them to make up the new room. The ""apartment"" was perfect. We had a dining area, a separate lounge area, a large bar with an iPod dock and speakers and a great sleeping area. The decor is ultra modern, but it manages to still feel warm, luxurious and comfortable. The staff was generous and worked hard to make us feel welcome. The concierge was very helpful and managed to get us on the guest list at Reserve on extremely short notice. We were also given special passes to skip the line at J Bar, but we didn't have time to use those. We were generally made to feel like royalty the entire time we were there. I was actually kinda sad when it was time to go home :) All in all, the experience cost me a small fortune, but for our once-a-year girls' weekend barhopping extravaganza, it was definitely worth it.";5;2;1;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1/8/2011;6YIgIWUYtiKLd1k3MCIM;FtxEQmSuSc2aku4AwOVr8w;"Thinking about having your wedding here? Well, look at the conference schedule for Chicago first before looking into booking this hotel! I really wish I would have done this - I think it would have made our wedding experience at The James so much better My overall impression of The James, after hosting our October wedding (which mind you was on a Sunday) here is that they are out to make money. Conferences obviously bring a larger profit for a hotel than a wedding does. The American Association of Opthamalogy's annual conference was in town over our wedding weekend, and The James did its best to accomodate conference goers with rooms before our out-of-town guests. And they were more concerned with the set-up of their events in the hotel over our wedding weekend than they were with ours. Our rehearsal was dreadful! They wouldn't let us use the room where we were hosting our ceremony/reception for our rehearsal because the conference was hosting a meeting! Obviously a conference meeting is so much more important than someone's wedding day?! We had to hold our rehearsal in this tiny side-room, and it really made the next day stressful and awkward because no one knew where to stand during the ceremony! The wedding coordinator also insisted on showing us how to cut the cake at our reception, so many of our pictures of this moment from our wedding have this person in them. Seriously, we can figure out how to cute our down cake, we didn't need this person micromanaging. They also screwed up my gift to  my parents. I called them and emailed them ahead of time about having them put my parent's hotel rooms for the weekend on our bill, and they couldn't even do this right! They ended up charging my parents instead of me, and to make things worse they charged their wrong credit card and it caused a huge mess with the bank on their end. Seriously, what kind of people do they have working at the front desk? My final rant about The James was how slow communciation was during the entire planning process. They would take weeks to get back to our emails and sometimes we had to stalk them to answer our questions by calling them! And we couldn't book our band until the last minute because they took forever to get back to us regarding our sound equipment questions. The whole experience wasn't all bad though - the James did surprise us by letting us use one of their penthouse rooms for the weekend. It is a gorgeous space! It was really fun for my bridesmaids and I to use this to get ready the morning and it made for great photos!

The service was top notch.  We didn't have a remote for the stereo to listen to our ipod so we called the front desk...the remote was at our door in less than 3 minutes.  Turn down service includes a tasty little cookie and more Khiels products if needed.  I loved that check in and check out was 2pm.  It really allows you to enjoy the room.  If I ever need to stay downtown again I'd stay here in a heartbeat.";5;1;1;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Maybe I'm hard to place when it comes to interior design. The positives of the hotel (and trust me, the positives outweigh the weird issues I had with the interior design and AC) include: the David Burke Primehouse (wonderful!), the housekeeping (prompt, attentive, fast like ninjas), friendliness of the staff, and LOCATION.  We were all over Chicago and the James Hotel really felt like it was the perfect location if you wanted to walk to Millennium Park, grab a bite to eat at XOCO or any of the other Rick Bayless restaurants, and then grab a drink at the Hancock Tower (which was exactly what we did when we were in Chicago).

The rooms are very clean and the mini bar is by far the best mini bar I've ever seen in a hotel if you are a drinker.  These weren't your sample bottles of booze.  They also have Kheils soaps which I love and they give you new ones everyday.  Turn down service was wonderful it was nice to come back to your room to music playing and soft lighting to help you start to relax.  The beds were super comfy.   I would definitely pick The James as my first choice for hotels in Chicago.  It is worth every penny!";4;1;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

I could barely get out of my KING size bed because it was so comfortable nor did I want to! :) The lights were wonderful you can dim and adjust the lights just how you want even in the bathroom! real plus for me. It's just such a luxury to have dimmed lights in the bathroom I'm mean simply amazing! staff is very friendly. I only gave three stars because of the food menu prices the hotel offers. Ridiculously high with 18% tax plus 3$ charge for room delivery, with all that you pay to stay  there it should at least be reasonable food prices. I mean how else would you get your food unless they deliver it to you????? so of course you would have to pay.

There are so many small details that obviously someone has given a lot of thought to.  The ambiance and the room amenities are hard to beat.  It was almost like having a little place of our own in the City.  The whole experience was just very, very comfortable and welcoming.  Everyone at The James went out of their way to be helpful and service oriented.

The bath products were Khiel's and added that special touch. All around a modern, clean, QUIET hotel. Their club the J bar (detached but just around the corner) had great cocktails and funky house music (gotta love Chicago house music). There were some misunderstandings when I booked a massage in the Aveda spa but the front desk manager worked hard to make it right and my massage was fabulous (and at a discounted price). In fact, the entire staff was VERY friendly and eager to help however they could...I even received suggestions on some cool nightspots from the person who delivered my shot espresso. They get bonus points for all of the doormen being sexy! I didn't give the hotel 5 stars because I was less than pleased with the room service. One night I had to refuse the food for being cold. On the plus side, they offered a nice selection of fresh squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. The other reason they didn't get 5 stars, my bill at checkout time was incorrect. Located within a block radius is Starbucks, Trader Joes, a decent Mexican restaurant and Grand Lux Cafe (yummy spot operated by The Cheesecake Kitchen).

The staff at the door, at the counter, in the fitness center, in the halls, all professional and courteous. The room was how I like them: modern but comfy with cookies on the pillows and great entertainment centers. We made ourselves at home and lived picnic style off the Trader Joe's across the street. The bathroom was amazing, sporting the best toiletries possible: 4-oz bottles of Kiehls shampoo, conditioner, and body wash with a Garden Botanika oatmeal cleansing bar. First time I have EVER used a hotel conditioner on my hair. Thanks to the maid for hooking me up with a few for the road... The gym smelled like ranch dressing, but I'm sure there was a perfectly legitimate and temporary reason for this. It's small but wasn't crowded any of the times we went. Individual TVs on the cardio equipment, with better-than-airplane-quality disposable/free (depending on your perspective) headphones.

The concierge was knowledgeable, and recommended some great places to go, and eat, and dance the night away.  We made reservations to places we wanted to cancel and they did it for us. The door man is always there to help with luggage and get a taxi.. yet they don't stick around waiting for a tip, so you don't feel obligated to dish out for service like opening doors. The restaurant attached to the restaurant was incredibly delicious, and the wine selection was great.  I was so stuffed after eating there. The mini-lounge/club was disappointing. I think the lounge in the hotel lobby was more fun. Drinks were expensive, and not that great in the side lounge, but there was no cover, only mandatory coat check.

They have turndown service and leave a sweet baked treat on your pillow every night... and housekeeping comes twice everyday.  Excessive for some, but I like things clean.  The rooms are spacious--ours had a little nook for office work.  The bar was great--very well stocked, with the usual amenities and iPod dock, but also with actually good late night snacks (real munchie food) and martini glasses ready for use.  They always left a fresh bucket of ice for us everyday as well, which was very nice.  I think we got room service at some point, but I can't remember, so can't really comment on that.   There's also a really well-stocked gym downstairs.  It's a lot nicer and has more equipment than most hotel gyms.  Fresh towels, lemon water, etc.   Conveniently located in the center of Downtown.  It's right across the street from Trader Joe's, which was awesome.  We picked up champagne and wine there everyday.  Also not far from Second City, and 5 minutes from Blue Chicago (awesome blues club).

The lobby is smaller, but it is very stylish, elegant, and well-kept.  J-bar (the hotel bar) offers great Grey Goose cocktails at reasonable prices. The decor of the rooms is super modern, elegant, and comfortable.  The beds are piled with plush pillows and super soft bleach white cotton sheets and duvet covers which must be 600 thread count (yes!  no crusty bed spreads!  all cotton!). The service and amenities are phenomenal.  Room service is super fast.  If you ask for towels at 3 in the morning, someone will be there in a few minutes.  Details such as free New York Times newspapers, free office center usage (including a flat-screen Mac computer), free late check in, free access to the equally stylish gym, robes, and free top of the line toiletries  that you find at Neiman Marcus is what sets this hotel apart from the others. There is a chef concierge and a entertainment concierge.  Enough said.  They are more than willing to figure out your likes and dislikes to find out the best places for you.  They make last minute reservations for you at places where most people have to wait two weeks to get in. I stayed at this hotel on NYE for only 150 for a standard.  The room was spacious and had a nice office nook, a sexy red patent leather recliner chair, and a bar that boasted patron, grey goose, etc, with a lot of counter space.  The marble bathrooms provide superb luxury. The downfall:  the only mirror is in the bathroom, which makes it hard for a bunch of girls to get ready.  Lighting could be better.  Parking is 50 for valet or you're on your own with the public garage that charges you 17 dollars for the first 1/2 hour.";5;1;0;0;N;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

The James would be a GREAT place to have a corporate party, engagement party or anything involving food, drinks and lots of people. I attended a private party there during my stay and they treated us so well--everyone was really surprised.

We also got exceptional service and smiles from poised doormen and even extremely happy housemaids! What a joy to stay somewhere where the staff feel proud as well! Their rooms were very well appointed, we LOVED the minibar with fun extras (naughty ones too!) and who doesn't love Keils's bath products. IF I had to be nitpicky I would note just two things: one of the sheets on our bed had a tear in it towards the corner, which was nothing too freak out over. And the 2nd thing was that the walls in the bathroom could have used a once over, there were lots of short black hairs on the gleaming white walls. I imagine from the person before us blow drying their hair. Again, nothing huge. We were extremely happy with the luxuriousness of the bed, the barcelona chair in room was immaculate.

Everyone and I mean everyone from the Valet parking staff to front desk professionals were out of their minds friendly and helpful, which is refreshing! We had a room on the 16th floor with a great view of Chicago life below but when we arrived our keys didn't work in our room. A very helpful housekeeper saved the day by immediately calling a supervisor who let us in the room and within 5 minutes we had our keys with numerous apologies.  No cheap room amenities here, Keihl's products galore! Friday night we dined at David Burke's Steakhouse on site which was divine. Dry aged steak was the best I have ever had, martini's reasonable priced and deliciious! Saturday after breakfast at nearby Grand Lux Cafe which I would highly recommend we spent the day shopping on Michigan Avenue, awesome shops including Crate & Barr ell and Tiffany & Co within close walking distance of The James. We arrived back t our room around 3pm and were a bit disappointed that our room had not yet been serviced by housekeeping. Called the front though and immediately got fresh towels and we were happy and when we came back from dinner our room was thoroughly cleaned with their nightly turn down service and cookies, ice bucket filled, dimly lit lights and music playing.

Hey - you sell your rooms to hotwire so don't get upset with me for booking with them at a cheaper rate. It just really bothers me when a hotel has a 4, 4 1/2 or 5 star rating and I have a bad experience from the moment I call. It's not what I would expect.

9/16/2012;0N5q1jULdWdA6JcSOShm9Q;0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w;"This is review of the N. State Street Embassy Suites in the heart of beautiful Chicago. It is based on my stay here from July 28 to August 3, 2012. The review is broken into categories. Location!Location! Location!: 4 stars     The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago on busy N. Street halfway between U.S. Cellular (Comisky) Park and Wrigley Field. It is convenient to public transit. The El runs underground along State Street. It is near to Chicago icons including the Magnificent Mile, The Chicago River, The Loop, and the Navy Pier. The nearby dining choices are commendable. They include Weber Grill (I rated it 4 stars), Rock Bottom Steak House (I rated it 3 stars), Pizanos Chicago Pizza (I rated it 4 stars), Pizzaria Uno, and a dictionary worth of others. Suites: Its a suite not a room-3&1/2 stars   Embassy Suites rents 2 room suites. They are spacious, yet not perfect. The Maids did a remarkable job maintaining the cleaniness of the room. The beds were comfortable. There are two beds in the master bedroom and a couch that converts to a bed in the secondary bedroom. The refrigerator allowed me to load up on healthy snacks from the nearby Trader Joe's.  Just like the two other Embassy Suites, I stayed in, bathroom ventilators were nonexistent. Being a suite, a closet is more justified than a cabinet. East-facing rooms have a natural alarm clock. Owing to the fact that the drapes fail to close all the way, I found myself rising with the sun. The suites shut out the noise from the adjacent room at the same time there is noise exposed from the adjacent suite into the secondary room. Amenities: This ain't Motel 6- 4 stars   Staying in Embassy Suites satisfies my vacation philosophy of coffee by day and alcohol by night. The Manager's Reception has got to be the greatest amenity happening in the hotel industry. From 5:30 to 7:30, the base floor of the atrium turns into an open bar. Drinks are unlimited, with the exception that you can only pick up one drink at a time due to state law. After 2 hours at the Manager's Reception, my stress was momentarily history.  In the morning Embassy Suites provides a freshly made breakfast buffet. And it is good. However, it gets crowded. The hotel gets taken over by guests carrying around plates of breakfast. In my case, I use the other breakfast amenity, the Starbuck's downstairs, and the Starbuck's stores within a couple blocks radius of the hotel.  For people wanting more than coffee and alcohol, there is a swimming pool and hot tub. The water temperature was satisfactory. They stay open to midnight. Nearby to the swimming pool is a gym.   In the atrium is a business center. I never failed to get a computer. The business center comes in handy on account of the fact that wifi is an extra charge and a high phone signal is sporadic. Conclusion: One more 4 star Embassy Suites.   Embassy Suites-a Hilton division- has yet to let me down. This is one more Embassy Suites that I recommend.";4;0;0;0;N;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

Five of us shared a room on a Friday night in May 2012.  As far as the room goes, beds are soft and comfy - I slept so well!!  Had everything we could need (hair dryer, fridge, table, couch, etc) except free internet.  Interesting room layout - windows overlook both the outside of the building and the walkways on the inside - a little strange, but understandable as the center of the building is filled with light secondary to the big atrium with skylights and a decorative fountain on the first floor that surrounds the seating for brunch. A nice bonus to the hotel - free drinks between 5:30 and 7:30 and a free breakfast in the AM.  The breakfast was delicious - made-to-order omelets, potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices.  Definitely a good deal for a big group like ours who were looking to relax and have a few drinks. The location is ideal.  We don't mind walking so we took a hike to Navy Pier, down the Magnificent Mile past the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building to Millennium Park and Buckingham Fountain, west to the Sears Tower, ending up at Giordano's (my favorite deep-dish pizza place in Chicago).  At night we went out on Hubbard Street, a place with many bars/clubs to choose from.  There are lots of restaurants nearby, making settling on a place for dinner difficult.  We settled on Volare as it's not a chain and people on Yelp love it.  :) Oh, and while the hotel parking is expensive (over $40 with no ins-and-outs), there was a small lot on the corner that let hotel guests park for up to 24 hours for only $25.  Nice deal, but so small that it probably can't be depended on to be available.

Alas, after negotiating for quite sometime, we realized that we didn't have enough people on our guest list to meet their minimum requirement of $15,000 (which is negotiable...depending on when your wedding is).  We only had about 75 people for our wedding and there was no way we could meet that minimum.

It's just like any other Embassy Suites, beautiful atrium, free cocktail hr, free hot continental breakfast, staff was nice, concierge was awesome and helpful-- all things great right? Well... The hotel slipped a letter under our door informing us of the $millions that they spent renovating the hotel and rooms... From the condition of our hotel, we could NOT tell. There were chips in the wall of the tub and there were spots of mildew, the room had a peculiar odor, the lighting in the bedroom was horrible and the A/C was loud and annoying. To top it off, we had some issues with billing. When you checkout, any hotel on this planet is supposed to provide you with a receipt with any possible charges that you are responsible for, KEYWORDs: Supposed To!!! But the gentleman at the front desk said that since my Mom was using her HHonors points ""Everything will be taken care of"", well, long story short, it wasn't and there were some ridiculous charges that they were throwing at us and all these issues could have been taken care of before we left but we had to deal with this issue weeks after we checked out, damn tards. Other than my 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, I have to say that the hotel is in an OK location. If you're coming to Chicago for the first time, I'd suggest something closer to Navy Pier or on the Loop because this was pretty far from all the tourist attractions. Other than Portillos, McDonalds and Walgreens, you pretty much have to take a cab or walk for miles to get to where you want to get to. Thankfully the concierge was AWESOME. Phillip was so nice and sweet and is the only saving grace for this 2-Star instead of 1-Star rating. He mentioned a tour, one of those Hop-On, Hop-Off tours that was WAY better than paying a cab fee. It was about $27 a person and it took you to all the tourist attractions. Love him! Return stay is not in our future, we will look to the other locations...

What I liked about this location that I hadn't previously anticipated was the proximity to Grant Park, the Bean, the Bridge, etc. Being a native Chicagoan, it's embarrassing that I hadn't been before...super cool and super easy walk there.

I also ate at the little burger place in the basement...perfect for a quick meal, had a cafeteria feel, easy with kids, reasonable, and served beer...perfect. The room. We had a great view of the river, it was big and comfortable, of course comfortable beds. Since we had a kid, they were very quick in delivering a crib and fridge for her baby food.

A slam dunk initial visit.  By July 29th I told her it was a go, and please send over the contracts.  We would love that room. Then I sent a couple more emails with the same request. Called every couple days.  No response. Finally on August 9th she said she'd send the contracts to me ASAP, what name would I like to have on the contracts. I told her mine. Next, no contact, no reply.  Emailed every few days...... called every couple days.......  finally got a hold of her on August 17th, she said she'd get the contracts completed and over to my by Friday (2 days away). Then no contact, no reply.  Emailed a couple more times.  Called several more times.  Left messages.  More messages.  Messages for her assistant.  Finally called her today- August 24th- guess what???  That room will be closed for a DOOR REPAIR the evening of October 5th- when our event will be held.  No can do. Seems to me that most hotels would figure out a door repair so that it wouldn't coincide with an evening thousands-of-dollars dollars reception.  Especially considering they had until October 5th to figure it out.  Guess that door has to be repaired that day, that evening. The room was lovely, my immediate reaction was that this was going to be a slam dunk.  I had to beg and beg and beg them for over a month to let me get a contract for this event so we could do business.  I don't know what the issue was that caused me to get such poor treatment, but this is how it happened.  I do event planning for my company all the time, and having to beg for one month to engage in a contract is not the norm. Probably for the best.  Who knows WHAT kind of time I would have to put in to let them know the menu for the evening. Oiy. Disappointing experience.";1;1;1;1;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

ANY place in downtown Chicago charges and arm and a leg for parking... duh.  Overnight anywhere is no less than $40 ANYWHERE, it sucks, but it is what it is in Chicago... use the public transportation, duh... and if have business outside of downtown, stay there, it's cheaper.) I came into town with my daughter to see my parents who live outside of downtown so we thought we'd get a room downtown make it easy, see some museums and all that good stuff.  We found a ridiculously good price, below $200.  I've stayed at numerous 'high end' hotels and this is right up there, easily worth about $389 for the two bed room we had.   My overall ""five stars"" comes from the value per dollar.  The last time we were downtown we stayed at the Fairmont, which was an absolute joke for the price (small, useless lobby), nowhere to eat, ugly rooms without any function, it was sooooo overrated. However, not the case with the Sheraton.  AMAZING place, top to bottom.  The lobby is the best/biggest lobby I've ever seen in my life.  It has different sitting areas, some with ""coffee tables"" that are actually touch-screen games (chess, checkers, etc).  There is a nice sports bar right there... all with an amazing beautiful view of the river through the enormous windows (whereas the Fairmont is closed and dark).  This lobby is super open and inviting.  Note, though... the two ""you are here"" maps are wrong, their stickers are flipflopped, so finding the elevators was a bit of a task at first. Our room was great.  Super clean, good-sized, amazing view.  Flatscreen tv (which has become standard at this pricepoint these days), great sitting area by the window.  The beds were too comfortable... no joke, I couldn't wake up.   The location is perfect for walking around.  First of all, it's right on the river, you can't beat that.  And, it's a couple blocks from Navy Pier for the tourists in town staying here, but the pier has a great children's museum.  It's right off Michigan Avenue, the Wrigley building is right there (which is basically the heart of downtown).  This location doesn't get any better for seeing downtown. Eating.  There are a ton of restaurants on the grounds here, all seem to be great standalone places that happen to be in a hotel.  Yes, they are all a bit higher in price than tourist trap places, but the quality is great.  We had breakfast at the place downstairs... for $25, it was all you can eat buffet.  They serve regular breakfast but I'll agree with my parents (who are extremely cheap, btw) that it definitely was expensive, like $12 but a basic breakfast; couple eggs, toast).  But for $25 you get it all -- and it's all made fresh.  (Damn, I need to review that place now, if I can remember its name) Anyway... other than Vegas hotels, I couldn't remember a hotel having more to offer than this one.  I highly recommend it, especially if you can score a sub $200 deal like we did.";5;1;1;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

Free bottled water in the rooms. 7. Minibar that left space for me to put my own drinks in the fridge. A few problems though: 1.

The shampoo.  The Westins and Ws have pretty nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc, but the Sheraton stock supplies are horrendous.  No body wash is provided, only a crappy bar of soap.  No face was is provided.  And the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling like I washed it with glue.  Bring your own and please complain so hopefully they change it.  Minus one star. 3. They double charged me for internet because I connected on Wi-Fi and with the wired connection.  But they fixed it immediately when I called in and emailed me my updated bill, so no minus stars.  Internet was still pretty slow, though.

So what I am writing about today is the absolute ABOVE AND BEYOND service my boyfriend and I received from, yes, San Diego. ""San Diego"", you're asking? Yep. We decided to send his parents here (who live an hour away from in Indiana) as part of a wine and dine Chicago weekend as a combined anniversary/Christmas gift. I called the hotel ahead of time to tell them about this special couple and to ask if there was any way they would consider a room upgrade. **DISCLAIMER: Now I want to make something really clear here. There are times that hotels just do not have the ability or the room to give out upgrades. So please don't think you'll read my review and magically get upgrades just because you ask for one. It helps that this was Chicago in the winter, and thus there was more likelihood for upgrade availability. Well, I received a voicemail at my office from a lovely lady who let me know they would be upgrading my boyfriend's parents to a club level suite. On top of that they also informed me they would be giving them an anniversary amenity, and assured us everything would be great with their stay. They emailed the credit card authorization forms and got everything taken care of in advance of their arrival so all they had to do was RELAX! When my boyfriend's dad - who is an extremely even keeled man- called to let us know they had checked in, he was actually choked up! It is not about a ""club level suite"" or the amenity. It *IS* about making a very special couple know that they are just that - special. My written thank-you will be following, but I cannot stress enough that if you just ask nicely, even if you can't always be accommodated, the staff will do what they can to make you comfortable. While in Chicago I do have many options and several hotels I do absolutely enjoy. However, the ""Towers"" will be my home away from home of choice for not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. HUGE THUMBS UP on my Thumbs Up list! and I mean HUUUUGE!";5;3;3;2;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

First room we had was very outdated and cramped.  Due to some major issues with room service, the manager upgraded us to a newly renovated room. It was slightly larger, had new carpeting, updated bathroom and a great view of the river/city. Ate breakfast here twice. Got the full breakfast buffet the first time. It was pricey at $24, but good. I wouldn't rate it great. The second time, I got the Continental for $19. Found a dead bug in my dish of fruit...they comped my meal. Bistro / patisserie has good coffee and a small selection of pastries, etc. A bottle of Fiji water will set you back more than $5 - more than most airports I've been to. Stock up on snacks and bottled water at Walgreen's nearby. Yolk is a good breakfast / lunch place, and it's near the hotel if you don't want to drop $20+ for breakfast.

6/2/2011;RENjGgbGCwbHKV6LO2PXkQ;BJPDZ1zQalqd7_9NIUXrmA;"My first and last experience in a Sheraton. This is a review from 2009 but I was not yelping then and I feel that it is important that other people know about my experience. I was booked along with two other rooms for a conference, I am a student and we were traveling in a group. I had a room with another girl and we were taking a nap in between panels when someone walked into our room. Luckily we were awake enough to realize someone was walking in the woman said sorry and promptly left the room. Me and my roommate wondering what the hell is going on went out into the lobby talked to the woman and apparently they gave her our room after being there for two nights. We went to the front desk quite pissed off and even though all three rooms were booked at the same time according to them we only booked our room for the two nights. So without even knowing that we left or that the room was cleaned up our room was given away. The woman at the front desk was a bitch to say the least. She acted as if it was our fault and made us feel grateful that we were not being kicked out of the hotel. I wanted to choke her. The situation was fixed but the fact that someone just waltzed into my room pisses me off. Next year this conference is again being held at a Sheraton, I plan on staying at a different hotel. Also NOTHING was included at this hotel and at the time when looking at the website it gave the impression that things like pool and internet were.";1;0;0;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The employee who took my call assured me there was a shuttle and that it ran 24 hours - although this was contrary to the hotel's website, I took her word for it. Flash forward - I land at 11pm, am outrageously tired and navigate the terminal to find the shuttle service (which is quite a trek). No shuttle there. I call the hotel to ask if there's a schedule or something, and the woman on the phone laughs and says ""the shuttle stops running at 7:45pm."" Needless to say, I was not happy. Sheraton must have a sixth sense that involves knowledge that I like to write about things on Yelp, because when I checked in, they upgraded me for free to one of the fancier floors with a view of the lake. No free internet, though AND I still had to pay $12 a day for the gym (are you serious). Unlimited membership throughout your stay will set you back $20. The bed was very comfortable and climate control (aka making the room nice and toasty) was intuitive and functioned properly. As a New Yorker, I am pretty used to walking everywhere. Even by my standards, the walk to and from public transportation was a little bit long - 10 to 15 minutes depending on which L train you're taking or the Metra. Good thing is, quite a few L lines are in the vicinity of the hotel. Downtown gets pretty dead at night, so it's not the place to stay if you like to party or enjoy nightlife. 3.5 stars.";3;3;2;2;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

Continental breakfasts were a 2 stars ho hum...The bagels, pasteries, juices, etc are things you find in any hotel lobby.   Coffee was very dark roast.   Why people associate quality coffee with dark roast is beyond me.   I roast my own coffee beans, and roasting beyond the second crack of the beans destroys all the subtle flavors. Lunches were 4 stars and much better:   We had pork tenderloins, pot roasts, mac and cheese, numerous green salads, cooked veggies, tomato bisque, and a wide selection of desserts.   The apple pie here is one of the best I have tasted.  Not too sweet but the apple flavor dominated, not the sugar.   The pot roast was excellent.   Yes a comfort food, but they nailed it here.    Food was prepared well in nearly all cases, a couple of times there was a miss but there  was enough variety.   The misses?...surprisingly, the soups here are weak. The pre dinner appetizers were also 4 stars.   The entrees included shrimp scampi (with the very large cocktail shrimp, not the Red Lobster shrimp McMiniNuggets size), filet mignon medallions (quality of their beef is 5 stars...very tender even when rare),     Had roast lamb (it was tender and seasoned great), roast turkey breast, two types of risottos, a brie pastry ..a foot and a half in diameter, an assortment of grilled veggies, several types of finger food desserts, calimari, and on and on.     It started to come close to Wolfgang Pucks catering down the street, but no cigar. Dinner was also 4 star quality overall.   Salad was good not especially memorable.   The soup was a spicy scallop Asian fusion thing that was tepid.   Is that a new direction in Asian fusion or was it just sitting too long?   We had surf and turf, a white fish...that was overcooked and dry, but the beef filet about 1.5 inches thick was superbly cooked.  It was a cumin based, southwestern oriental flavor.   Again Asian fusion influence in the kitchen, and it was excellent.   It obviously was grilled correctly, charred and singed on the outside....uniformly medium rare on the inside....deep red but not raw....really well done.   The desserts were a mixture of different things...fruit compote, a tart, a scoop of ice cream coated with toasted coconut, almond mixture. Although the Sheraton kinda misses on the soups and fish, they do buy high quality beef here and it shows.  The pork and lamb were also prepared with expertise.    This is a real meatlovers place to go.";4;2;1;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
9/26/2007;FthZOP5jLxdkNQVxAMRECA;rej4bFEmHjCsL0C_RmyLow;"Really- this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I am not a complainer but I felt like everytime I turned around there was something to roll my eyes about with this hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived after a 12 hour car trip from Philly at around 12 am. We knew that places like this fill up quick and called to ensure that our room (that had been reserved 3 weeks prior) was kept even though we were getting there late- no problem. We arrive and they have no rooms w/ beds left...so they gave us a room w/ a sofa bed and told us they'd upgrade for the following night. The sofa bed had no sheets on it, there were no pillows in the room and no remote control for the t.v. OK. Called the front desk, asked for these items and waited. Waited some more. Called again. A guy came up with 1 pillow (when we asked for 2-not an unreasonable request) and sheets. 10 minutes later someone came with the remote. Next day they told us the room could not be upgraded so we were moved to a traditional room (lower then what we originally booked). We got back from doing our touristy stuff, got the keys for our new room and our luggage was nowhere to be found (they told us they would move it), so we had to call a couple of times and have it tracked down. To be fair they discounted us $150 dollars and sent up some free fruit and water(whopee). Not worth the mental hassle and time it took away from Chicago enjoyment. The valet guy - Ed, I believe his name was - was very nice and patient while we unloaded a ton of bags from our car.";1;2;0;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

What I got was an amazing room (small, yes, but I was just 1 person who'd be at a conference most of the day) with the most amazing bed I've ever slept on, and a freaking awesome coffee maker. The staff was just extremely friendly and accommodating. I spent a good portion of my time in the internet cafe, which was one of the few places to get wireless internet. The staff there would grab me a sandwich or a drink even if they were in the process of closing, which was awesome. Considering the amount of geeks that had converged upon this hotel for a few days, I think the staff went above and beyond to make sure everyone was taken care of. Also, I kinda blame the Sheraton's bacon for my downfall from vegetarianism. One drawback - no wireless in the room.

Convention accommodations:  the exhibit room hall had a few issues.  As an attendee, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the layout or the noisy HVAC system that was above some of the break out ""rooms"" that were on the exhibit hall floor.  The ballrooms and river or lake rooms were neither hot nor cold, but sometimes the temperature and attention to detail (like the coffee running out) was a bit lacking.  Having to ride the labyrinth of escalators was also a bit trying -- but basically the staff was reasonably attentive to the needs of the convention goer. Rooms:  I had a 15th floor corner King.  It was clean, my housekeeping staff were quite helpful and mindful of my privacy and the view (facing east) of the ice laden river and vast expanse of the frozen lake was breathtaking.  Because I was under the weather for a good portion of my visit, I didn't get to go exploring or utilize the workout facility.  For this, I will need to return when the temperature is well above 25 degrees fahrenheit!  And next time, I hope to be up just a little bit higher.  Nonetheless, I had an auto club association rate that BEAT the rate negotiated for the convention, so I had no real complaints about what my money was being spent upon. Proximity to services:  I wheeled myself from the CTA station at Clark & Lake with ease - and found that the neighborhood had many of the basic necessities.  Particularly important was the closeness of the Walgreen's -- which when one feels like the bottom of an icy river covered with a burning inferno -- is a welcome sight! In hotel services:  I had breakfast room service -- which was pricey but decent portions.  Too bad I couldn't really taste anything!  Business center staff, concierge and front desk have the 411 on assisting the business traveler and the bellmen have the taxi queue dialed in so one didn't have to venture out into freezing weather and wait for very long. Yes, Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers, I noticed that you appear to still be renovating some of the rooms -- your 32nd floor Presidential Suite was stunning and well appointed -- so please keep at it -- and I will recommend you to all of my friends who wish to stay on the ""north"" side of the river!";4;1;2;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

Now on to the negatives... - Room feels old.  The linens reminded me of my grandparents linens from the 70s.  The bathroom was antiquated with old fixtures, decent shower. - Dirt in my bath tub.  Not sure why and it washed out fine, but seriously. - Ethernet cable didn't work.  I called to put in a request to fix it, went to get take-out and to the grocery store.  Got back about an hour later and no one had come by to fix it.  Called again and they sent someone up shortly, but you shouldn't have to call again. - O'Hare lost my luggage, I notified the bell man that they would be delivering my luggage over night.  He assured me they would leave me a message if it came letting me know it was in.  Wake up the next morning with no message, assume it has not been delivered.  Check on the airlines website and it says it was delivered overnight.  Sure enough, went downstairs and it was there.

I can hear every time someone come in and out of that room, and it would wake me up in the middle of the night. I should really not deduct a star for one particular room because not all the rooms are that way. I guess I'm getting soft...

Stayed here since it's essentially a conference center hotel, and I was attending one.  It's just a standard Sheraton.  Nothing that sets it apart from others.  It's located on what's essentially a dead end, which is nice that you don't have to deal with traffic directly in front of your room. I didn't receive any recognition for being an SPG Gold member, but was ""upgraded"" to a ""corner"" king room.  By that I mean I was lucky to have a view of the western part of the river and the Trump tower.  I asked for a high elevation floor (22 isn't too bad) on a corner since we aren't entitled to a suite, and did get one, altho a co-worker with no status got 26th floor and a better corner room.  oh well.   NO WIFI at this hotel.  Really??? It's a Sheraton, so you get the comfy bed.  That's a plus.  Bathroom was not designed very well.  It seems like you're a mile away from the tv when in bed.  Doors around your area close VERY loudly. There are better options in the area if you're going to be spending the usual rate of roughly $200.  My advice, if here on vacation and your own dime, is to priceline a hotel around the mag mile or loop. The two VERY nice things I have to compliment them on is the desk clerks being very helpful with my questions, and the ability to go to the locker room outside of the gym to change clothes before my room was ready.  It's a nice locker room with soap, shaving cream, q-tips, lockers, and showers.  It does take a fortnight to get to from the lobby, however.";3;0;0;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

If you are traveling with a dog, this hotel is nicely situated for some ood walks either along the river, down to Navy pier, or along Michigan Avenue.  There is also a park with some grassy areas just in front and down the hill from the hotel.  No walking for blocks to find a place for your pooch to relieve themselves. Two bits of advice.  First, don't self park.  I chose to do this to save money (not sure that I did) and to better maneuver the dog after check-in.  I should have taken it slow (they would have let me leave the car out front while I took the bags and the dog up) and let them valet the car.  We never used the car again while we were there -- opting to walk or take a cab.  Self parking was a pain.

I've noticed that the Sheraton's room rates are normally at the higher end of comparable properties, but we got a great rate with parking included.  This made it an especially good experience.  Unfortunately, they got our bill wrong, but a visit to the front desk got it easily corrected.  Overall, I'd say the Sheraton is worth a visit, and if you can get it for a deal, it's definitely a worthwhile place to stay.";4;0;0;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

It also featured a bare metal ""spoke"" where the knob for the heat/air should have been and cracked plastic surrounding that. Nice touch. To top it off, the ""wifi"" was $12.95 per 24-hour period and in my 72 hours there I was charged 6 times.

11/6/2010;hWynv8Q4-I2klOJFR5j1fQ;9SpIJmgWjJzaaOZfy-TVYA;"Stayed here for a conference so I had no choice in the matter. Despite everything being fully paid for, I would not stay here again even if my stay was paid for OR if you paid me to stay here. I'm not going to be drastic - there were no bugs in my bed, the floors were clean-ish and to their credit, the cleaning staff was incredibly nice. It's not like this place is a dump. However, it just didn't feel like a nice hotel (which, at the rate they charge, it really should be). I've stayed at Four Points which are nicer than this place in both hospitality and cleanliness. Let's talk about the hospitality. The front desk people here are RUDE! Almost downright insulting rude. The first day I came in to check in the guy at the front desk asked me in a very accusing way ""are you here to check in or what do you want?"". UHM why else would I be standing in the registration line? Then I asked if I could apply my Starwoods number to the stay and he said sure and handed me a Gold key. I was excited because sometimes conference don't let you apply your starwoods numbers to get credit. PLUS, I am one night away from Platinum and was excited to make Platinum. So off I go into my room. Like other reviewers said, no upgrades unless you're platinum. I didn't hear anything about a concierge level or ANY benefits that the hotel provided (probably because there are none that are free). NOBODY asked me if I needed help with my bags, nobody wished me a good day. Nobody told me where my conference registration was. And this is just check-in. Check out was worse. I got a voicemail saying I will be getting a bill under my door in the morning. I woke up at 8am, no bill. I went downstairs to check that I made platinum (I was one night away) and also to check out, and get a bill (I like to have a copy of these things). The woman at the front desk was terse and curt with me. She said that no, I was still Gold, that no points or stays will be added to my stay because it was a conference. Man, I wish the guy who checked in had told me that instead of getting my hopes up. She then said that she could not provide me with a bill of any sort because it was being paid for by the conference even though I know for a fact that extra expenses are not paid for by the conference. She offered no explanation and treated me with no respect. I left feeling very upset at not having made platinum after being such a long standing SPG member (and frequent traveler) and having offered no consolation. I asked where the Java Lounge storage room was and she said ""downstairs"". Well ladies and gentlemen, she was wrong. I finally found the luggage storage area which was not downstairs but was on the same level and was SCOLDED by a Sheraton staff member for not wearing my conference name tag. By now I was both upset at my conference and with Starwoods for providing such an upsetting experience. I know this review sounds more like ""I'm upset because I didn't make Platinum"" instead of ""This place sucks"" but I would say that there is a right way to approach customers and a wrong way to approach customers and I would say that the front desk and members of the staff here (cleaning staff excluded) were the rudest hotel staff members I have ever experienced at ANY Starwoods hotel. I thought for a minute it was because I'm a Southerner in Chicago but then realized that no, I have stayed at the W City Center in Chicago before and everyone who works there (from the guy who opens the door for you to the people who check you in) are more than accommodating, nice, and a fresh breath of air when you are away from home. I will end this review with a review on the catering here. The vegetarian options are good, the cookies are hard and way too huge, pound cake and any baked goods are always dry, and there is a wider variety of soda than water. Oh, and the beds were not comfortable. Please don't even book this place as your wedding hotel as you will probably be more upset than me with your experience.";1;1;1;0;N;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

She looked at me like she was so pissed when I asked her if she could bring me an extra bath towel. The 1st thing I noticed when I walked into our room was a stain on the bed covers, that is not cool. Some one did come up and change it. Yes she brought new linen and everything but as she was putting that new linen on I noticed a blue ink stain on it, and I didn't care but about it, at least it wasn't a bodily fluid stain like the previous one. But in front of my face she just flipped the covers over, so that the side with the stain wouldn't show...disgusting. I have put some pictures up of the bathroom, why was there mold in the bathroom of a supposedly 4 star hotel room. The concierge's desk, what a B****. She told me the night we checked in that I could pick up some breakfast coupons from her, and when I went to pick them up the next day the B**** was like I don't even know what you are talking about we don't have such a thing as a breakfast coupon.

No one as at the door to help with our luggage, and the doors are not automatic. Im a pretty easy going gal, so I helped myself. When we get to the room, its very basic, to say the least. Brown walls, brown floor, no decorations. Just basic. I get ready to make a local phone call and see that its 1.75 , and an additional 50 cents (or around that) per min after the 1st thirty mins. I assumed local phone calls would be included in the $100+ bucks per night I was paying to stay there. The fridge is stocked with vodka and snicker bars. And when I say stocked, I mean good luck trying to put your food in. I suppose this is there cute little way of saying eat the food they supply??? The candy is $4.00 The vodka, I don't know. I ask an employee where I can find a microwave, so I can warm my daughters food. He appears annoyed and tells me to call the front desk. When I call, they inform me they can send me a microwave to rent for $25. I tell her no thanks, but I would like for someone to come and empty the vodka out the fridge. I worry that my very active and curious toddler may get hold of it. She says ok. One day later, no one has come, and I move it myself. When I asked for a tooth brush, im told that I cant pick it up at the front, but they will deliever it. It ends up being a 40 min delivery.

We were there in the winter so I can't speak for spending time outside the hotel facilities so we definitely took full advantage of the inside. The people at the lobby were super nice, the decor was fab-u-lous throughout and the actual hotel room was spacious, clean and had a very chic feel to it. We left as happy guests. The best part of the hotel is that it houses Wave restaurant which is like Mediterranean tapas and it's absolutely delicious and definitely cost effective. This 4 star hotel is a great location to stay for both tourists, locals and even if you're on business trips, the concierge will be friendly and polite and the bar is definitely worth checking out and if time allows, make a reservation at Wave. And I have to mention that I got a really good night's sleep when we stayed our one night, bed was super comfy and those pillows, I was seriously contemplating taking them home with me.";4;0;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
9/25/2012;9yStfyRS5CISu-May43dmA;I4Y8LZRCN9B0gCQFPYYdCQ;"stayed at the property over the weekend, got a fantastic rate on priceline. We took the blue line to Clark/Lake and then took the taxi to the hotel. Check in process was smooth, we had a wonderful room with a view of buildings across the street. Room was nicely furnished, flat screen, high beds, window shades between bedroom and bathroom. The room smelled nice and the furnishings were in a fine condition. We got a glimpse of the rooms with a view from the elevator waiting area - it looks our directly at a beautiful beach with Navy Pier to the right. I can imagine how amazing it must be to wake up with that view in the morning. It was raining on Friday night, we asked to use the hotel umbrella when we went out for dinner but apparently they were all out. The agent at the front desk offered us her personally umbrella but we declined (I think her name was Arianna - great service). We also had forgotten the charger for our iPhones, although they weren't able to send us one for our room, it was no problem to stop by the front desk and leave it there to charge in the back. We did that for 2 nights. The welcome desk was a little chaotic the two times we needed to speak to them, and when we did their attitude wasn't entirely pleasant. That was the only minor flaw to the hotel besides the unusually slow elevators that seemed to stop at every floor every time we needed to go to the lobby. We had plans all weekend, so didn't get to use the pool, restaurants or bars on site.  We rented a zip car for 2 hours for our little excursion on Hot Doug's on Saturday morning. The car was parked a block away in a lot, very convenient. Other times we took the Red line (Chicago), explored the city on foot, and at the end of the night we took the taxi to the hotel. The W Lakeshore is located a bit far from the river and Michigan Ave. but the lake view is simply breath taking. If the weather was warmer, the pedestrian path by the lake and the beach is just across the street. Perfect for someone who wants to go for a jog or just relax by the water.";3;0;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
9/19/2012;ZLe;UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg;"I'd like to make a confession. I don't really like W hotels all that much, but I REALLY don't like this one. Whatever. Whenever... though personally, I'd like to put a little more emphasis on 'Whatever'. I don't like walking into what looks like a club with blasting music and $16 martinis in the morning. I don't like feeling like you have to be sexy at 8am, 2pm and 4:00am in the morning after you've been rained on all day/night and the concierge at W hotel has the nerve to recommend the Hangge-Uppe as a decent after hours bar... for that cruel joke I should actually give 1-star but I'll be kind regardless of what my ovulation cycle is telling me. I will say that I do enjoy the quirky rooms at most W locations, though I feel like this W is lacking the quirky and leaning more towards stuffy. I don't like being ignored by the bartender or being carded by the same one twice in less than hour after not moving seats. Never has there ever been a more invisible neon orange-haired person than at the W Lakeshore's bar. I know most people probably come here from out of town, but my experience was for a weekend-long and God-forsaken bachelorette party so I was more than non-plussed when I found out that parking here over the weekend would cost me close to $200... a price that I simply can't afford, and would refuse to pay for parking anywhere regardless. I ended up hitching a ride with the bride and husband-to-be so that worked out, but then we'll get into the nitty-gritty of paying what the room rate for this hotel is vs what you get. On a typical rainy, chilly and windy as f*ck Chicago day, I wouldn't consider the W Lakeshore to have much of a view. Looking out the windows to the stormy, grey Chicago days outside was like taking a photo of depression and charging people $400 a night to look at it. No thanks. Waiting for a cab at their cab stand was brutal. We basically had to add 15-20 minutes onto any of our travel times to accommodate the long lines here, and the car service they had was never available at any point from Thursday-Sunday, sooo don't count on trying to save any scratch or be able to take advantage of any of of the perks. The front desk told me that the best way to be able to get a reservation in with them was to come down a half hour before the concierge opens and wait in line to try and get a booking. Uhm, I don't know about you, but getting up and going down to the club atmosphere lobby at 7:30am and waiting in line for 30 minutes to ask for a ride. F*ck that noise. Oh and for the price of the room on weekend, I was expecting a bowling alley in there or something, not just 2 beds, very little room and a bathroom with ZERO privacy that actually has a window you can open to see people on the toilet. Kinky... but not totally my thing. I just don't dig it and I don't know that I ever will.";3;21;11;16;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

I am a frequent patron of the Starwood Family and this was absolutely dis-concerning. The concierges didn't even know the area, nor were they friendly or helpful. And when I finally dragged out of them a recommendation, it was probably the worst meal we ever had. He basically googled the restaurant that was closest to where we were going. Unacceptable.     The Acura car was never available and the spa was not enjoyable. The bar-tending staff was rude and slow. The elevator took forever and in a elevator conversation with another guest, they initiated the conversation on how disappointing this hotel was and chaotic and relaxing.

5/30/2012;r3F;OUEGiNw-bZcsvCfmfFCg_A;"W hotels and ""child-friendly"" are two terms that don't normally go together.  Usually, the trendy euro vibe, techno music and stylish bar/lounge make it the kind of place that parents used to go to. However, this W is different.  The location next to Navy Pier and all of the child-friendly parks and activities in the neighborhood mean that parents with young kids flock here, especially on a holiday weekend.   The hotel itself seems to have an identity crisis about this. Others have mentioned the poor use of the rooftop - the event-only space that apparently used to be a great restaurant.  On the pool level, a great outdoor patio overlooking Ohio St Beach and Lake Michigan is poorly utilized with a small, lonely bar and a few high tables. Where are the lounge chairs and the music that would give it a Rio or Miami-style vibe? Instead, with a small grill serving hot dogs and burgers, it had a family cookout feel, and it shut down around 8 (perhaps because the kids needed to get to bed). Speaking of kid-friendly areas, the pool area has no hot tub, but comes with pool toys so that the young ones can have fun.  It's also difficult to get food and drink service there (apparently you have to pay a 20% service charge and a delivery fee if you want anything other than the kid friendly food and limited bar on the patio.) One more gripe - in the morning, hot water was iffy in the shower - maybe it's tough to get it all the way up to the 32 floor. With all that said, since I wasn't traveling with kids, you may wonder why this place gets 3 stars? The answer? The view from a room on a high floor is downright breathtaking - get a room with a lake view if at all possible. The view can stand toe-to-toe with any ocean view on a sunny day, and is well worth seeing for yourself. The room was laid out so that you could see the view from everywhere (including the shower). The peaceful beauty of it might even help soothe you after a day with the kids. If the W starts a family-friendly line, this might be ground zero. But for the single partiers, guys/ladies nights out or young couples, I say go for the other W - City Center. For families and those that love a nice view, come on over - you won't be alone.";3;1;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Good for business during the week, and a happening nightspot on the weekends (anticipate Vegas style noise from the drunks in the hallways Friday and Saturday nights). The bar had the usual mix of great bartenders and crappy, unattentive ones. If I recall, Mich Ultras we're $6 bucks, which seems kinda high, even for Chicago. We were there at the same time as an instagram party, which meant we got some gratis apps, and watched as people attempted to look more important than they really were, a la Hollywood style. The hotel room itself was nice, clean, everything as it should be, though as with many of the W chain, the bathroom is not sealed, rather has plantain shutters between the toilet and the bed...which when paired with the lack of a vent fan, can be awkward for a romantic weekend. The gym was small, yet well appointed. Wifi is free in the lobby...but they try to make you pay in the rooms. No surprises here.";4;1;1;1;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

It wasnt - twice in 5 days. Not good enough. - I used their house dry cleaning service to clean and press a suit. The prices on the dry cleaning were what you'd expect from an in house luxury hotel service. The issue? I had a small split by one seam of my suit pants. SMALL. Asked if they could repair it (i could have with a needle and thread) and they said yes. They did, for $61! Sixty one dollars? Give me a break. $10 is standard, so $20 would have been standard for a hotel. They also just did it, and didnt tell me how much it would be. I was floored. None the less, I will stay here again.

Pros: -The bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept on: super comfortable and very plush -Hotel gym is one of the best I've seen: great views of the lake for the cardio equipment and a really nice indoor pool -Desk attendants downstairs were very attentive and willing to respond to any request -The restaurant was decent -Magnificent views of Lake Michigan and the Near North -Shower designed so that you can steam your clothes in the bathroom and not burn your hands trying to turn off the water.  Underrated but really nice feature! -Great location if you're doing business in the Magnificent Mile area Cons: -Shower itself was ok; not strong enough -Shampoo/Conditioner smelled terrible; seriously thought about going to Kiehl's nearby to get samples instead. -Wicker/Bamboo accents in the room were one shutter-slat away from being a Hollister. -Because the hotel building was rehabbed to be a W, there are some dings and older, slightly broken features in the rooms. -Desk staff RARELY answered the phone when I called down from my room.  I had to go downstairs to request anything from them. -Horrible location if you're spending most of your time in The Loop; also really far from the El -In room WiFi was kind of expensive -Ceiling in the gym was too short Overall: Hotel has some great features and plenty of room for improvement.  I'm sure there are better W Hotels elsewhere, and despite a really awesome bed, will likely stay elsewhere next time I come to Chicago.";3;0;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

We were up by 8 to make a flight.  So, if you do the math, we spend about 7 hours at this W. That said, yeah, I'm totally a fan. This is the kind of place that is thinking about how to make an impression even if you don't notice. Well, I noticed - probably because that's my job. An example: taking the elevator after check-in, I noticed the rugs said ""good evening"". Through the fog of the previous night, the next morning I noticed they said ""good morning"". Possibly kitchy but the W can totally pull that kind of stuff off.

There are a few things to know about this particular W. It's hip. Bumpin' hip. Sparkly top hip. The design choices while interesting, are maybe not the most functional.

The view overlooked the lake which looked like the ocean as well as Navy Pier (walking distance).  It reminded me of Ocean Beach in Miami.  Outside of the hotel are rocking chairs where you can relax with a drink (HIGHLY recommend the raspberry mojito or don julio tequila sunset/sunrise...).   The bed was heavenly.  The bathroom had the ""rain"" showerhead which if you read my review on the Four Season in Santa Barbara, I go on and on about my love of it.   In-room Bliss products are also great - I am hooked on their sage face wash. The service here was also excellent - they really strive to achieve their ""whatever, whenever"" service policy.  For example, we walked in late and missed the breakfast menu, but they were still able to serve us French Toast (albeit probably out of the garbage...).   Oh and for the health-conscious, their gym is amazing...but their indoor pool is definitely lacking (though you could easily just go across the street to the lake).";5;3;1;2;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Lots of glitz and glamor, lots of hip and trendy-looking architecture and amenities (showers without doors, flat-screen TV's, etc.); but overall the service was no better than comparable hotel chains. The best feature of this hotel is its location. The views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier are spectacular. W Hotels seem to attract a certain clientele. Young, ""hip,"" narcissistic, club-hopping Gen Y alcoholics. To be fair, it may have been this location, but I felt like I was at a meat market. Plus, I was awakened at 3:00am one night by a large and loud group of people looking to ""continue the party"" in someone's room next door to me. So if you just need a place to stay during business meetings, this W isn't worth all the pretentiousness. Any of the Kimpton hotels in the area offer much better value (and much better personal service) for the price. But if hip and trendy is important, if you want to see and be seen, W could be for you.

I'll keep it short and sweet. I travel on a weekly basis for work and pleasure, have stayed in both fantastic and terrible hotels around the world. No story is necessary...when I fly across the country from LA on a weekly basis, I would like to arrive with first class treatment late on a Friday evening after a long work week, especially at $400 per night. Customer service is most important, and non-existent at this establishment (as pointed out by previous Yelpers). Even when I had a ""good"" stay in weeks prior, service was mediocre, room service blah, bar service...yikes. Oh, and hotel staff at the front should probably know a little something about the surrounding area, restaurants, etc...despite the fact that visitors can see the shadows of Navy Pier from their windows between the lake fog and the windy rain, a little ""local knowledge"" may go a long way here.

I'd originally reserved a room elsewhere, but a reservation mixup with Expedia landed me here - and in hindsight, I couldn't have been more lucky! The hotel itself feels more like a hipster lounge than a hotel. Upon entering the lobby, you will be greeted by smiling faces set in an ultra-chic club room of sorts, complete with dark wood and metallic tile materials, falling water and fresh baskets of apples (a part of the W founder's tradition). The entire hotel smells of a light, almost floral cologne - it's delightful. Soft house (read: electronic) music flows and adds to the air of ""cool"". The room we stayed in was not terribly spacious, but it was satisfactory enough. A great view of the lake combined with W's legendary matresses made for a fine stay. My wakeup call I had scheduled the night before even included a recommendation to bring my sunglasses, as it was quite a sunny day. The Bliss Spa is also a luxurious indulgence, I received an awesome manicure there. At night, the lobby turns into a full-fledged lounge, complete with cocktails, cool furniture, a bar and a DJ. Very cool! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the W. Extremely comfortable beds, helpful courteous staff in an ultra-hip environment is the name of the game.

Service while good just feels false, almost too good.  Did not appreciate being charged to have packages delivered to the room, seemed cheap for a hotel in this price range.

Since I live in the city, I only stayed over one of the three nights, but I spent the better part of those days in the W and it was quite nice. The first night's event was at Altitude which is the open space at the 33rd floor... The room is all windows with an astounding view of the lake as well as the city.  The ceiling was a little low, but again- the view made up for any nit-picky short comings. Even the elevator is a delight...or a party. It always smelled lovely in the elevator, which you don't realize how nice that is until you're crammed in with a flock of tourists... The elevator music was not your typical sleepy tunes- they were playing Peter, Bjorn & John and other hip anthems. The food was catered by the W and it was good. Not great, but really decent considering they were feeding more than 300 people. On the final night, I stayed over and the room was terrific. I probably had one of the few bad views (looking right out to a cement wall) but even that didn't take away from the overall pleasure of staying there. The bed was possibly as comfy, if not more, than mine at home, and the dcor, while sort of cheesily-trendy, was very comfortable. Also- no generic combined shampoo/conditioner and dry smelly soap...

High Points: *The concierge has a list of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel.  This is an excellent feature because room service for dinner is rather awful (see low points below). *The room itself is very comfortable and clean. *I lost an earring.  Housekeeping found it and placed it where I would see it.  I was very pleased. *They have a nice facility for a gym *They have an Acura car service that will take you around the city for free, as long as you sit through a 1 minute video on your ride and listen to the driver talk about the car and fill out a short survey.  (Service is available from noon-7pm only.) *Navy Pier looks like its in walking distance.  I could see it was close from a hotel window. Low Points: *Hotel room service is bad and expensive!.  I had the chicken pot pie for dinner which was just gross.  It was a lardy mess and not really a pie at all with the tiniest pieces of chicken and veggies almost like the kind that you would find in a can of condensed soup.  I also ordered a $12 slice of carrot cake, which for the price I hoped would be amazing and it was small and just 'meh bordering on not good.   *The shower kept changing temperature!!!  I took two showers while I was there, one long and one short (I know, TMI huh?). During the long shower the water temperature got cold at least 5 or 6 times.  And during the short shower at least a couple of times.  That is just plain old unacceptable! *They have a popular happy hour.  That in and of itself is a good thing, however, the bar is right next to the reception desk.  The music and crowd was so loud that I could not hear the front desk staff as I was checking in. *I got a double room when I asked for a King. * The hallways are noisy in the evenings, sounded like hotel staff. Other points: *They have a very interesting menu option: fresh fruit with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and......a disposable camera.  Enjoy! :)";2;1;0;2;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Book the hotel if...: if are young or ""feel younger"", into or somewhat into ""urban chic"", and you are plan to take advantage of the hotel's offerings. To book the room isn't that expensive but to take advantage of what the hotel offers, is. For example, their Whenever Wherever policy - you can basically get whatever you want, when you want it (like White Castle burgers at 3am delivered to you by the hotel staff). Rooms: made for couples. Don't plan on coming here with your family or if you do, get separate rooms. For example, there is no bathroom door. Rather, it is a sliding wood door that it not on rails (it's a ""casual-optional"" door and there is a wooden window from the bathroom to the bedroom that is meant to be kept open. LCD's in every room, minibar has everything you want from food to booze to hats to ""love packages"" (condoms, lube, mints and some other stuff). The toiletries are from Bliss so yeah, actual name brand stuff unlike most hotels since most top hotels have their ""exclusive"" brands but they don't mean anything because the dealer only deals to them; so it's actually generic). If you're crazy about spa, they have the Bliss spa experience. They have a great pool (indoor of course); it's open to all hotel guests so no need to do the spa if you don't want. They have a club/bar upstairs that has an AWESOME view of Chicago. If you're a hotel guest, just flash your card since there will be a line to get in on weekends. If you want feel pampered (and you are willing to spend the money for it), you  will have a great time here. You can also be discreet to and enjoy all the amenities. Friendly and very-knowing concierge desk. Since it's at Lakeshore, this part of the city is relatively quiet compared to the inner-city. Even with the lounge downstairs and club upstairs, you won't hear anything in your room if you want peace and quiet.";4;0;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Well at check out I brought this up and the lovely front desk agent and she credited $50 and apologized for the breakfast fiasco. So on Monday I review my charges and there is OBSCENE amounts charged to my account.  I called the accounting dept. and the accountant was extemely apologetic and helpful.  That was all cleared up after about 2 days and now, to restore my faith in the W they offered a free room.

Bliss Spa is great too, and kudos to them for associating themselves with such a great name in the Hotel industry!! One more thing, the bar upstairs, I think it's called the Whiskey- has an amazing view of the skyline.  Everything in the bar is black, so if your drunk enough, it feels like you are floating in the black abyss.  I love it.   If you ever get a chance, check out the W in LA... that's where my love affair began!";5;3;4;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

W has gotta decide whether to be a club or a hotel, i think. after getting thru the party line (excuse me, pardon me, sorry) i finally reach the front desk for a quick check-in, no problem. but it is still really odd to have partygoers checking you out while you're simply trying to check-in ... a bit disconcerting. had i known, i might have dressed for the check-in?!? (lol) parking fees are expensive because spaces are precious. some streeterville parking spaces can sell for +$50,000!!! so taxi to/from W at all times.  it's cheaper and convenient. you can walk the magnificient mile or pier on nice days too. the food is good.  i love the breakfast menu and the openness of the restaurant - lounge area, garden, lake view - refreshing. the rooms are comfortable, artfully designed, and spacious. i prefer the relaxing lake view but the city view is also good. i do not use the pool or spa but most say they are nice too. i love to run the path that stretches for miles along lake mi. and of course if you wanna party, friday/saturday is rockin! ;)";4;2;2;2;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

8/17/2009;EjbpPiSgsaWfU9GknKTzFw;ziCQaUkmWS8-SivmFYAwBg;"Let me preface this 2-star review with the following: If this was any other regular hotel, it'd be 3 stars. But, this is the W, and I expected a lot more out of you! There were some redeeming qualities...awesome Bliss toiletries (though on day 1 I was missing conditioner and lotion), great location (close to everything without being directly on Michigan), comfy beds. BUT...There were many problems. This is a Chicago hotel! Do the words ""form follows function"" mean anything to you people?! In W's attempt to make-over the Days Inn, common sense really went out the window. For starters, the bathroom?! WTF? if you want any privacy in your bathroom, don't stay here. Seriously, a sliding wood door with slits, and a ""what the hell is it doing here"" window cut-out with wooden shutters? No overhead fan? A shower without a full door? I had to use a towel just to keep the floor from being completely soaked. Also, no closet, just some shelving. While nice-looking, it was inefficient. It was weird putting my shoes in a drawer. The shelf for my suitcase is directly under the hangers, so when I go into my suitcase, I have clothes hanging, literally, in my face. Annoying. Also, there were some little things that, again at any other hotel wouldn't have been a big deal, but this is the W! For example, both mornings the free coffee was empty. Refilling involved me talking to 2 different people. Lobby (excuse me, ""Living Room"") is way too small for the traffic. Despite 5 stations for front desk clerks, I never saw more than 1 or 2 which resulted in long lines and a crowded lobby. Also, it's hard to forget this was a Days Inn...ugly-colored walls, ,and a ""This used to be a cheap hotel"" stench that just wouldn't go away. If you're going to drop a lot of money on a fancy Chicago hotel, I'd advise looking at other properties. If you want that ""W Experience"" try one in a different city. But, if you can get a good deal, and don't come expecting much, by all means stay here!  When you book your room, request a lake view.";2;2;1;1;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

12/3/2009;HJtST4UMYL9SBi8rPra0Uw;P2W508PlOY2LYzDtbXk1tw;"I am semi cross posting this with my review for the hotel's restaurant, Wave's, since the major issue of hotel security affects those staying at the hotel as well as dining here. I was recently robbed in the restaurant in the hotel's lobby.  My purse was tucked between my feet under the chair/table, and at some point during the meal, it was stolen.  We later realized that there was a man sitting behind me who had turned his chair around and leaned towards us, and we believe he used his foot or some kind of implement to drag my purse out from under the table unnoticed.  Pretty ridiculous, right?  This is the sort of thing that takes practice.   The hotel management was unhelpful to the point of being actively combative when I reported the theft.  I immediately filed a police report and was met with rudeness and a complete lack of assistance from any of the hotel management.  The security guard especially was purposefully rude, and when I complained about the treatment, as the victim of a crime, to the manager, all he would say was, ""I have no control over the behavior of the security team.""  Um, you are the manager of the hotel, and that does not make any sense.  We eventually got the security manager of the W City Center on the phone, who apologized profusely and began to actually help us, including taking down a description of the suspect from the people who had sat across from me and letting me know how to file a formal complaint with the hotel, which the hotel manager had completely neglected to do.  Even in a less trying situation, this customer service would have been unacceptable, but after being robbed in the hotel, in what now turns out to be a repeated occurrence, it became downright offensive.  It's too bad, because I had been a big fan of W properties, but I would never, ever come back to this restaurant OR hotel again.  Potential future visitors, consider this your official warning. After reporting this story to friends, I found out about several other women who had the exact same thing happen to them at this restaurant over the past year.  That sounds like a really bad pattern to me.  Since this has happened, the police and my insurance company's private investigator have confirmed that this hotel is a very common spot for robberies in Chicago.  The fact that the management evidently does not take this seriously is a huge problem.";1;4;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

SPG Platinum status rocks! I was out when I received a call back from the Welcome Desk (front desk) that my suite was ready. The suite on the 22nd floor overlooked Lake Michigan and Lakeshore Drive. I entered our suite to a large living room and desk. There was a 42"" flat screen television, sirius satellite radio, dvd player, and CD changer. The bedroom was to the left and the master bathroom was off to the side of the bedroom. The bathroom had Bliss bath products. The nice thing about this bathroom was that it had both a shower and a tub. Let me just say the shower was divine.   The bed is also wonderful too. I swear whenever I'm staying at the W it's so so difficult to get out of their plush signature bed. Another nice thing going on at the W's is the Acura experience.

And I'm not a podunk!!  The hotel is very modern and the beds are VERY comfy!! And, the bliss products are great! We were on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier.  Now, we didn't understand the swinging wooden doors between the bathroom and the room but it didn't bother us enough to complain about it. We just thought it odd. We were there just to have a girls weekend and when we asked the Whatever Whatever staff on suggestions on night life they were very helpful and sent us to some great shows and made the reservations and arranged a car to take us there! They were a gem on both nights that we wanted to go out!!  We travel a lot and I will be checking out the W's in other cities as well!!

1/20/2010;ZS5WThBFalWLMUjOEuTpFA;Z3vY6CM1aSJcyDMrFfhPIw;"I have stayed at the W (Lakeshore Drive) a handful of times, and I have never been disappointed. The staff is very polite, the rooms are well appointed, and the scene/atmosphere is very young and trendy. One of my favorite aspects of this hotel is a very very small thing, and  is something you might expect from the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton's and Peninsulas of Chicago. The W changes out their elevator rugs three times a day. In the morning it reads, Good Morning, in the afternoon, Good Afternoon, and in the evening, you guessed it, Good Evening. Like I said, this is a very minor detail, but in my opinion, it's the kind of detail that helps justify the price and set  the hotel apart from others. I would like to make a couple comments on some of the reviews I have read on this hotel. In regards to the Silver Wall at the hotels main entrance, I think this is a lot less tacky/gaudy then a lot of other reviewers because I believe it is one, intentional and two, a good fit with the hotels overall theme. I would agree that, if a Four Seasons had this outside of its front doors that yes, it would be tacky, but the W is all about young people having a good time and in my opinion, it works. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is not a family hotel.... not that families are unwelcome, but I would be a little uncomfortable with one of my parents going to the bathroom and/or taking a shower in a bathroom without an actual door. The beds in the rooms are very comfortable. They have that softness that you know you couldn't sleep on every night, but is heaven for a night or two. The gym at the W is not great, but does have enough equipment to get the job done. I have not been to the spa, but I have heard good things. The lobby bar and the Whiskey Bar upstairs (great view) are both great, and get very crowded on the weekends and are an awesome spot to spend your night or stop in for a nightcap before you head to your room. Overall, I like this hotel and will definitely return, if you are looking for a fun hotel to stay at, the W is one of the best choices in Chicago.";4;1;1;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Nice decor, friendly people, music was great ,a really nice ambiance. Then I went to my room. It was OK I guess. Nothing extravagant but what is up with the bathroom? It has a sliding door that you can't lock and it's made of wood. Then there is a sliding wood window. So if you are squatting to use the bathroom the person outside of the bathroom just slides the window open and peek a boo....they see you! Then it's not like your typical hotel where you will find a bible in the drawer. Nope.... you'll find condoms to purchase and a $13 romantic CD. There is no coffee in the room for your morning coffee. Room service is way overpriced, definitely did not order room service. This hotel is way over prices honestly. I stood there and usually I will park at the hotel and get my ticket validated because I am a guest....nope...$55 when I got my car back for a 24 hour stay. Now lets talk about what happened at night. The elevator door opened at the Lobby at 11:30pm and the smell of weed hit me in the face. There is a lounge/club on the 8th floor that everyone was riding the elevator to get to. It is tiny but yet hundreds of people were going there, way over booked and the people that were going there were all stoned. I guess I had a different impression of this hotel. It is in a classy neighborhood so I did not expect all the craziness that went on that night to be allowed there. I was even surprised when I went to the front desk there were 3 guys chipping in money to get a room. They were putting in $1100.00 for a room, they were arguing because they didn't have enough money and needed to go out to the car to get more. See I didn't even know you can get a room paying cash, I thought a credit card was always required. Needless to say, I won't stay there again but it's a nice place to hang out at the bar on a normal day with friends. Oh....the pool was nice and warm I enjoyed that.";3;0;0;0;N;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

It was a great room overlooking the lake. The food sucked but whatever. A week later I noticed that I had been double charged. So I was now out $1200!!!! yup and I'm a teacher so you know I ain't got no money. The amount we paid ahead was $500 for two nights. Then suddenly we were charged another $700. Eventually it was all taken care of after many phone calls and much frustration. The only reason I'm giving at A-OK is because they offered that we stay there again for free to let us have a better experience.

I had exchanged emails with both the Direct of Group Sales & Catering, as well as the Wedding Specialist, and had an appointment to meet the Wedding Specialist and see the space last week.  Unfortunately, I was stood up.  I arrived 5 minutes early for the appointment and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes until giving up and leaving.  The very nice Concierge did her best to try to track down the Wedding Specialist to no avail.  After 30 minutes of waiting, another employee physically went to find her and came back to say, sorry she's in a tasting.  I'm not sure if she was double booked (she confirmed my appointment the night before) or if the previous appointment ran over, but there's no reason she couldn't have sent word to the lobby with her apologies and/or asked someone else to show me the space.  What's even worse is that 9 days later, I have yet to hear from her with an explanation, much less an apology.  I also contacted the Direct of Group Sales & Catering explaining my disappointment 7 days ago and have not heard from her either.  If this is the way they treat people during the sales process for a pricey event, I'd hate to see how they treat people who are already under contract.";1;0;0;0;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

I am cool with that, I am hip with it. ;-0 The staff actually were very helpful, patient, and eager to answer your questions...so that was a plus. Also a plus was that they kept part of that beautiful lobby/elevator area not as renovated, which looked great. The rooms were ok, clean, newly renovated (most of them), so the decor was nice. Be ready for the reminders that you are in a Hard Rock hotel, so eg guitar embroidered on pillowcase, posters of artists around the room, and such. In our bathroom, David Bowie watched me brush my teeth, so that was, well, different. Two cool factors, and even then, other than location, the hotel was just ok: every floor represents a different artist and has a piece of their memorabilia.  That provided a little entertainment for us. (We were on the Cheap Trick floor, if you ask the front desk they have a whole list.) Also, they lend out guitars (electric and acoustic) for free, first come first serve, so you can have a little jam session in your room.

They for sure do not take good care of your car at all. Next, the food is terrible! I ordered a Cobb salad-how can you screw this up? They did. Also, the chicken bites were full of fat. So gross. The good? GREAT location-minutes away from shopping. Also, had a really nice experience with the concierge, Zach. He helped us with restaurants, a route to run in the morning, and getting cab. Also, the elevators were very fast which was awesome. We got a corner room which was very spacious but so poorly lit! There is an entire hallway in the room with no light.

Things I wasn't as crazy about included the fact that the shower door doesn't close (it looks cool but inevitably you end up with a floor half full of water), and actually, that's not quite true.  There's no shower door at all, just a pane of glass and an opening.  I tried the downstairs bar, which was fine and appeared to be full of good company, but a little on the small side.   Bottom line, the Hard Rock Hotel tows the line you think they would:  staffers occasionally referencing you as ""my man,"" bellmen with the emo mustache, and space with all of the requisite memorabilia you might expect.  And my stay there was pleasant, definitely.  But I wouldn't shine a spot light on it and call it fifteen minutes of fame, either.";3;7;5;4;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
8/12/2009;Wh1P8G-T9;wCtf5_zG8EpWiBp_Oi7P0g;"""Oh and be careful with your mini fridge. It is weight sensitive, so the moment you even partially touch a bottle in there your room will be charged"" and then she ended that phrase with a cheerful, perky, giant **smile** My brother and I were kind of in shock that they do that at the Hard Rock, because I mean if you stay here, you most likely are semi social meaning you would like to have a drink or two, but that phrase alone made my brother and me not even keep our leftover deep dish pizza in the fridge because we were so worried!! Instead we left the boxes on our AC! ha ha But that aside, this hotel is pretty much amazing. We even brought over two friends to see our two queen bed, corner room with a view and they live in Chicago and were quite impressed with my brother's selection of a hotel heh. It has the coolest decorations ever and HUGE bathrooms. Each floor is themed with a famous rock star, our floor the Annie Lennox floor, and there was a giant head shot of her in our lobby and my brother couldn't resist the photo op to pose like she was heh Every room has a flat screen tv and black out curtains and we even had a hallway in our room!! YUP!! a hallway!! And we didn't even have a suite, so I wonder how amazingly spacious and fantastic those rooms are at this place!! ""Ummm adam, I can't see you because I'm in our HALLWAY"" we found ourselves joking about for the night. And of course it is complete with a few full-length mirrors because any rock star has to have a way to check themselves out before leaving for a night on the town!! The downside? Well it isn't cheap. The hard rock cafe is actually located elsewhere in Chicago (but there is a store downstairs for memorabilia) and parking isn't included (valet is $45 a night or something like that!). But you do get free wifi!!! And I mean how could you be a rockstar without free wifi?? I know I couldn't ;-)";4;5;6;4;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

We ordered breakfast in our room the next morning.  I tried not to yawn in the face of the very perky and friendly young woman who delivered our breakfast and set everything up at our table for us, chattering away the entire time.  I just wanted some coffee and to watch the news, poor girl probably thought I was a bum, but she was a good sport and really great. All in all I had a fantastic experience here and would definitely recommend it.";4;5;4;4;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
2/7/2011;sJGv0vNAfioOpNwQxrg1RQ;_TS0tZ5SmShQK6nYGa9IDQ;"I spent one night here  and had a marvelous stay. We got strawberries and melting chocolate sent to our room because we were celebrating a special occasion, it was a really nice touch! I liked the feel of this hotel, since it is ""rock and roll"" it doesn't feel uppity.. yet it is pretty nice inside. I don't feel like I'm getting stared at for being in my 20s. The rock and rollness of this place really stands our through their interior deco in the rooms mirrors, artwork, etc. The room itself is pretty spacious, with a nice and clean bathroom, wish the tub was a bit bigger though. We also asked for a guitar during check in but were then told that they were doing inventory and didn't have any  left. Then to our surprise there was a knock at our door and one of the bellman brought one up to us so we could rock out. We opted for the free guitar lessons on the TV, but there was no information on how we could access them, we had to call the front desk to find out what we had to do. Once we got on the correct channel, it was just completely blank. I don't know if it was because we missed the time (it only happens every 30 minutes) or whoever told us how to get to it misinformed us. Either way we rocked out for a little while and then we had to get back to our schedule. Either way it is a pretty nice idea and really fun. The only downside to the room is that the windows (although huge) are REALLY drafty,  we kept some of our leftovers from a restaurant on the window sill and it was kept nice and cold--that was how drafty it was! So we had to turn the temperature way up to make it actually feel like it was 73 degrees inside. Good think they had nice huge thick curtains to block some of the draft. They gave us free coupons for a drink at their downstairs bar which unfortunately we didn't get to use. But as we were in and out of the hotel between 8pm-2am , it was packed and poppin like any other club off the street. Pretty sure I saw a couple making out on one of the couches in the bar...! The concierge were really helpful in arranging things for us, leading us in the right direction. Our room was a great deal and overall it was a fun place to stay!

Reserve early when tourism season comes around, because the rooms will be taken before you know it. And there's a very good reason for that. Even during off season, you want to try to to book as early as possible. Emphasis on the chic and rock and roll. At the base of the building is the Hard Rock Bar, which is quite the spot to hang out in after a long days venturing throughout the downtown area. Alongside of course, is their little store of Hard Rock Cafe goodies. You know you have a collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-Shirts from different countries and cities somewhere in your closet. The rooms themselves are fitted, at least the moderately priced ones, with spacious bathrooms that usually work as quasi jet tubs, modern interiors, and if you're lucky an excellent view of Michigan Avenue. They even offer the call for your very own masseuse after hours or during the day.

The front desk staff is Post-Office-counter slow & not terribly brilliant, but friendly, managing to get the job done. (Eventually.)  Ditto for the valets. Rooms are modern, rock-hip furnished, comfy beds but overly squishy pillows. Agree w/ Gregory M., sheets are way over-starched.  Bathroom is nice, but lighting is awful (dim & overhead spotlight) so if you desire nice lighting for hair & makeup, you'll be disappointed.  Also, you can hear every door in your hallway closing & opening, so be sure to ask for a quiet room if you're a light sleeper. BASE bar always has a crowd, so if you're into that, you're in luck.  If you're looking for a chill bar, head to Morton's next door.";3;4;4;3;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

Here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be ""COOL"". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building, which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have  individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Café. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool, and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up, I won't be staying here again.  If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room, I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton.

We arrived early from the suburbs, overloaded with our heavy backpacks, but the front desk was super nice and let us check in 4 hours early! We giddily took the elevator up to our room, impressed with the all mirrored elevators and the white, European, short, skinny, boy  with a huge blonde affro that stood silently and pretentiously with us (undoubtedly both wondering if he was someone famous). Our room was on the 17th floor. Each floor is a different theme, we were on the Annie Lennox floor (perhaps we'll have sweet dreams we pondered). The view from the room was awesome, overlooking the river and part of north Michigan Ave. The room itself was a view to take in with plush beds, tons of mirrors, and fun modern furniture and plasma TV. The bathrooms felt clean and new. Needless to say, later that night, we had a lot of fun having some pre going out drinks. We had to resort to drinking in our room because the Base Bar within the hotel was ridiculously priced. We also had too much fun travelling to each floor to check out the different themes and memorabilia that was on display. When it was time to go out, the doorman helped us hail a cab, very friendly. Upon returning at night, we fell into a blissful sleep on the most comfy bed I have slept in in a long time. When we checked out the next morning, the concierge gladly held our bags for a couple of hours while we shopped and got brunch. We took time to admire the building one more time before heading out, and you have to admit that the hotel, which is in the old Carbide and Carbon building is one of the prettiest in the city. Modeled after a Champagne bottle, the roof top contains real 24 karat gold. Fabulous! One of the best Staycations I ever took!";5;1;2;1;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

I love Chicago architecture but there are many architecturally significant buildings in the city and its not like the hotel and its decor reflected any of the buildings stylings.... so it really has nothing to do with the hotel. BUT I liked the decor. Of both the room, lobby and bar area. Very sleek and modern. Loved the gray-purple walls in our room. The minimalist decor. The meant-to-look-expensive Warhol-esque rock-star images were cheesy but acceptable. Color-scheme - thumbs up. Aveda bathroom products - good job. Great bed and lots of extra pillows in the closet - rock n roll. The curtains definitely kept the morning light out - but, the rooms were not quite soundproof (from the bed, which was some distance from the door, I could hear the elevator and neighboring rooms' doors opening and closing - strange, not too mention light Saturday AM traffic). I laughed at the outrageous prices found while purusing the room-delivery menu and the mini-fridge items. Not like I was surprised. I just feel bad for the people (i.e. the out-of-towners up late night) who are stuck having to pay for all these things. (Whereas other guests may know there way around the loop or not be intimidated searching for a local convenience store). $3 for a can of pop. $7 for a bottle of designer water. etc etc. Good god, how horrible. My friend, living in the suburbs, got the room to serve as the base for her birthday celebration and I enjoyed the comfort and swankiness of the hotel but wasn't *super* impressed. The other guests we encountered during Saturday checkout were anything but urban sophisticates - which was cool. But contrary to what others have posted.... definitely touristy.

Anyway, we each ordered the sampler appetizer platter, and the little mini-hamburgers are fantastic, as well as the artichoke hearts - there were two other things included, but I don't remember (it was over 3 years ago). I'm assuming they still offer it. Additionally, the hotel donated an awesome overnight package to Northwestern's Dance Marathon (a huge philanthropy event), and I know they work with a lot of local and suburban businesses, so they get mad props for that.

We were there for 3 nights and would definitely book this hotel again; we had great a deal, which averaged about $140 a night.  The room was clean and huge; at first, we thought we had the worst room in the hotel.  The room was located back in a corner by the ice machine and housekeeping closet, yes, it was a tad noisy, but it was a corner room with 6 windows, 17th floor and one of the biggest hotel rooms I have had in a very long time, especially in Chicago.  The view was worth a little bit of noise. The beds were great as was the bathroom and the shower was wonderful.  We did not visit the bar or restaurant, with so many other great options in this city why stick to your hotel.  We were also in town for a surprise party and were on the go quite a bit.  Our friend used the parking valet, great service with those astronomical Chicago parking prices.  You might be able to find a cheaper parking spot looking on your own, but the convenience of in/out valet was worth the price.  The work out room was small; it had maybe 3 elliptical and 3 treadmills with some free weights and 3 or 4 circuit machines, not to bad though.  I would definitely stay here.";4;0;0;0;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

You'll know what I mean.   The location is smack dab in the middle of where all our activities were.  Just a short walk to Taste of Chicago and other interesting sites.  We reserved the entire 32nd floor which was compromised of 3 suites.  The Hard Rock did their best to renovate the rooms and to make them contemporary.  But yet there was no air blower/fan in the bathroom which could make for a stinky situation sharing 1 bathroom with several dudes.  Answer to the problem....can of Fe-breeze saves the day!  Other than that, we had everything we needed with modern comforts.  The views from our suites were simply spectacular, amazing, magnificent, you get the idea. I was a little turned off to see so many spider webs outside our window however.  But what can you do...it's an older building and we were after all on the 32nd floor.  I'm amazed now how technology has changed.  Case in point the mini bar.  They have this thing rigged so that it actually measures the weight of all the bottles in the fridge.  So in other words, I was thinking how I can swipe a bottle of liquor with a bag of sand ...a la Indiana Jones style..... Concierge service was exemplary and they helped us with any questions or situations that we had.  I should have stayed one more night with my friends, cuz apparently they met up with Snoop Dogg at the hotel on the day I flew out.....F*Ker's.... I'm jealous...I wanted to hang out with Snoop D O double Jizzle.... Final thoughts.  I like it....it was different...cuz it was an older building.  It certainly has it's own charm.  I intend to go back to Chicago maybe in a few years.  I'd like to stay at the new Trump Tower.";3;0;0;0;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

The decor in the hotel is very modernist with clean, simple lines and lots of photo-art featuring rock stars (David Bowie was above our toilet!). Attractive design, by and large. I stayed with my partner in a King Deluxe room. While not huge, the room was comfortable and the bed made for a restful sleep. My only complaint was that the sheets had an awful lot of starch. I just slept under the very soft down comforter: problem solved. The bathroom was spacious and came with an assortment of Aveda bath products. Mmm...minty. The customer service was really excellent. From check-in to check-out we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable. I had a minor complaint about the squeaky door in the bathroom and they sent a repair man up within ten minutes. The maids were quick and thorough and regularly maintained the room's amenities. While lacking a pool or hot tub, there is a nice gym with cardio equipment and free weights on the lower level.

We had 2 rooms that were joined by a door. I loved the layout of this. It added in a funky hallway. Unlike some other Yelpers, I actually liked that the room wasn't overly bright. It was very relaxing. Aveda products in the bathrooms, big plus for me. I love Aveda. We ordered a banana split and some wine that night. We ended up with a full tray of food. The only problem? While we got a great surprise with all this stuff, they forgot the banana split....and my husband didn't see the note (thanking us for returning, and letting us know that some of the items were as thanks for coming back) so he thought the whole order was wrong. A bit of a miscommunication there, but all was well. My only other comment would be the TV and its reception. While I don't expect every hotel to have some HD tvs in there, the reception could at least be clear. The reception there was all fuzzy, almost like we were watching tv with the old bunny ears.

It's close to Millenium park and at the south end of the Magnificent Mile.  Service was also just fine.  Overall, I probably wouldn't stay here cause it really was nothing special.";3;0;0;0;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
10/19/2007;V-EzAJq-HZD0xGuClzQkwA;ugB4E6sKdm0JeLerrfpZWQ;"REVISED RATING: 2 stars (3 stars too misleading) This place gets a merciful 3-star rating as it minimally meets ""decent.""  If I factor-in overall cost & value (even at $189 for a $799/night room), the rating would drop to 1 star. Cost/value-wise, this is by far the CRAPPIEST hotel I've ever stayed in, and beyond bragging rights of saying you've done the Hard Rock downtown Chicago, there is no reason to choose this hotel when so many others in the city offer TRUE luxury, comfort, and superior amenities for LE$$. Frankly, I've stayed in $89/night hotels that easily blow this one away (and I say that with no exaggeration and based on my staying in Hard Rock's very BEST rooms). My Review: LOBBY LEVEL - 4 STARS: The lobby decor is close to being top-notch - the flat screens by the elevators make for an exceptionally nice touch. The lobby also houses the Base Bar, which becomes a happening spot late evenings and on weekends. (See Base Bar review for more info).  I only wish they had given as much attention to the rooms respective to concept and design. THE ROOMS - 2 STARS (that's very generous): This is where the aesthetics, quality, and prestige fall WAY short.   During all my stays here, I've been fortunate enough to get $500-$799/night king rooms/suites on the limited access 34th floor discounted to $180-200. (How? Booked through http://Priceline.com, then called the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and asked for a complimentary upgrade to the top floor. This works for most hotels, as well as cruise ship cabins - Try It). At first glance, rooms appear to be ""decent"" with the beds being the focal point, visually promising to be soft, plush, and comfy; however, under the deceptively attractive signature Hard Rock bedding, you will find dated, not-so-comfortable firm spring mattresses. Also, the ""feather beds"" the website and brochures rave about are little more than thin comforters.   Hard Rock should really look into upgrading to memory foam or adjustable air-bladder mattresses, like Select Comfort, if they hope to charge an average of $350 per night and expect return guests.  This is the new standard of comfort...even the Raddisons of suburbia have them. The bad news doesn't end with the beds. As you begin to explore the ""amenities"" of the room, noting the Rock-n-Roll theme in the art on the wall and bedsheets, you begin noticing a second theme: FAKE Nothing appealing to your senses is truly what it appears to be when closely examined here. For example, the dressers appear to be made of rare ""Zebra"" wood, but under closer scrutiny are in fact made of compressed wood with zebra wood patterned formica veneers and components of impact resistant plastic. Oh, and the cool-looking trendy single-seat chairs are in fact cheap office-grade furniture upholstered in uncomfortably hard gold/tan vinyl snake/alligator print. Since no one can possibly sit on these chairs for more  than 5 painful minutes at a time, they will undoubtedly last forever! The living room table is cheaper yet! (Look closely at chairs & coffee table in pics above). And the carpet! Before you walk into the room, it looks like standard hotel carpet, but step in and you can almost see your shoes wincing with every step. Take your shoes off and what you feel is harsh industrial strength carpet ""pile""...AH-HA! Now you know why your shoes protested so!  No doubt, this carpet was built for longevity, not comfort...and will be around long after we've journeyed to the other side. THE BATHROOMS - 3 Stars -  Looks like they put 85% of the room budgets (which must not have been a lot to start with) into the bathrooms, which are fairly large and decently appointed with stainless fixtures, tiled floors, and Rock-n-roll pop art. *VERY standard hotel bathroom for NON-standard pricing? Hmmm.... I guess I shouldn't complain too much since I've only ever paid 25-50% of the regular room rates, but even at those prices I couldn't help but wish I were somewhere else like in a Regency Club level room at the Hyatt downtown - now THOSE rooms are TRULY luxurious. RECOMMENDATION: My advice is do the Hard Rock for the experience and bragging rights, but only for ONE night. The other nights, book your stay at Sofitel, Swissotel, W Hotel, or Hyatt Regency (Regency Club floor - limited access uppermost guest floor). All these hotels come with Select Comfort, memory foam, or pillow-top mattresses, thick down-filled feather beds,  REAL WOOD FURNITURE, soft carpet, AMAZING VIEWS from upper-level guest floors, and spared no expense respective to design, decor, and amenities!  They are also less than the Hard Rock's version of the same rooms. Expect $180-$400/night (Priceline/Hotwire/Travelocity) depending on advanced booking and season. NOTE: Other Hard Rock Hotels - (Vegas, Miami, etc) are NICE.";2;1;0;0;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

5/27/2010;yaSLwvjnnP;Z2lzZF1OWsgtGGkF6FFuUg;"Let's be clear about this: I hate the Eighties. Perhaps I'm bitter because I officially did not get laid, even once, during that entire decade. The closest I came to actual sexual intercourse was watching old Lita Ford dry-hump her guitar on MTV. Granted, I was a teenager, but I still haven't forgiven Nancy Reagan for my unintended, decade-long abstinence. So, when I checked into my Eighties retro-styled hotel room for a weekend at the Hard Rock Hotel, my reaction was pure horror. Purple walls. Smoked mirrors. The image of John and Yoko staring at you in the bathroom. (At least, it wasn't Ringo.) I can only describe it as Miami Vice meets Sid Vicious. It's kind of room you imagine some coked-up minor record producer would try to hide a dead groupie. Hideous stuff. Putting aside my unresolved feelings of inferiority which were manifested in the 1980's....the rest of the hotel was surprisingly cool. There is definitely a rock-star theme going on throughout the premises, but it's less tacky than you might think. They actually managed some restraint. Patterned, rock star leather was to be found on all possible surfaces that could benefit from patterned, rock star leather. Their idea of ""elevator music"" is Beck, Bob Marley, The Killers, etc...a fun novelty. The gym facilities were genuine rock star quality as well. You could just envision a Rob Halford down there, working out his quads, in leather chaps. We entered the lobby on Sunday evening and were greeted by a ""celebrity"" bingo tourney, with an Amy Winehouse impersonator, cussing loudly at the mic....funny! Outside the elevators on our floor was Brian Johnson's (of AC/DC) stage outfit on display, complete with autographed white sneakers and guitar. You don't find shit like that at The Drake. What really won me over was the free guitar rentals. Yes, they will rent you an electric or acoustic guitar of your choice (nice ones, too!) to keep in your room for your entire stay. My poor wife...she thought a weekend in Chicago would provide her a few days of relief from my incessant fretboard noodlings. Give me a new guitar to play with, and I am like an infant. (The guitar rental form required the signature of the ""Artist's Name:_____"". That was a wildly pretentious moment. My guitar-playing is a lot of things, but ""art"" is not one of them.) Overall, there are certainly more refined and stylish hotel options on Michigan Ave to choose from. This would not even come close to being my first choice. (It was the official hotel for an event we were attending, otherwise I never would have picked it.) But, if you need to surround yourself with oversized images of Rodger Daltry and Angus Young on a 24/7 basis to keep you happy, this place will do just fine.";3;4;3;7;N;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

The place is advertised as a four star hotel, but it felt more like a 3star to me.  Maybe that is because I had just checked out of the Westin in Minneapolis and had a truly 4 star hotel to compare to.  Don't get me wrong, the place tries--they have minibars and 24 hour room service, as well as a fancy remodel. But they just can't help that the building they remodeled is old and dumpy, and some aspect of that character still shows through the remodel.  The spa and fitness club were a couple of rooms in a dark windowless basement with low lighting and no locker room I could find--not at all spa like.  The rooms were clean, though, and the place was generally fine.

Bar has some decent craft beer (local selections). You can check out a guitar and Line 6 pod and rock out in your room. Our room had a pretty nice view. Cold A/C. Nice big TV with decent channels. Comfortable king size bed. Many food options across the street (although we didn't see them until our last day because they're inside a mall like area). Giordano's is across the street. Close to the river. Walgreen's across the street. The staff was overall pretty nice except one concierge. But I don't like tipping a guy because he handed me a map.

I really enjoyed my stay at Hard Rock.  It's in a great location - in between the loop and River North (restaurant central), by all the shops (maybe someday I'll have money to peruse them)!

Also, we had called to add on an additional night to our reservation prior to arriving.  Well, they actually made another reservation for the last night, so when we came back to our room after a long day, our key did not work. The front desk had not bothered to tell us that we would have to get a new key because they didn't add another night to our existing reservation but made an additional reservation for the extra night (which also meant we had to pay 2 separate bills). Finally, they have a very cool check in/rock out program where you can pick a guitar from the catalog to play with in the room.  However, after making a big deal about be getting to choose which guitar I could try, they brought the wrong guitar to my room.

Quick backround: went there for a bachelor party with 4 other guys, reserved the extreme suite at $800.00/night. When we got there we were all dressed nice as we were about to go out and reak havoc on the town. The guy checking us in asked if there was a special occasion and we told him our friend was getting married. He doesn't even let us finish before he starts lecturing us about how they have a strict no party policy and they wont hesitate to call the police if we get too loud or out of line (mind you we are all 27-30 years old, dressed nice and just booked an $800 a night suite at the Fucking Hard Rock Hotel.) So we went up to the room and it was very nice size, but the couch had all sort of love stains on it and half the stuff they said came with the suite (fridge, guitar with amp) wasn't there. We still had fun and checked out the next day, letting the same dude that checked us in know that we didnt party as he gave us this shitty kind of grin. They have a bar downstairs that was pretty good, but the restaurant they have there, China Grill, was overpriced and not that great...It was also my first time to Chicago and I was eating bomb ass deep dish pizza so that might have had something to do with it.

The lovely concierge even told me I could come back down for another room if the view wasn't to my liking. +1 you lovely concierge! My room was very trendy and up to date with modern fixtures and very clever use of space. Chicago has itty bitty hotel rooms in the older buildings but the Essex does a great job of utilizing what it has and the ceilings are tall enough that I can continue my tradition of jumping on the bed to christen the room. I love the view of the city from my room, the fantastic water pressure, the peace and quiet I get in my room and the awesome feel I get when I walk down the hallway. I feel like I'm in Quentin Tarantino's ""Four Rooms"" and feel glamorous when I spin around in the halls, the beautiful pool and my room.

2/2/2011;Qwnz3A0s8cVOyJO68wgWuw;y7yK2KDb_C_xG-RBpVpslA;"Chicago's Essx Inn was the perfect hotel for my boyfriend and I on our first trip to Chicago. We stayed for a long weekend and needed a cheap hotel that was on Michigan Ave (as to have easy access to all the sights). We checked in very late (almost midnight on a Thursday) and were still greeted as if it were a bright and sunny summer day. Our room was a little on the small side, but last time I checked the purpose of a hotel room is to sleep, change clothes, nap, and shower. This room was definitely adequate, but not 5-star quality. The bathroom was a bit small... especially the sink! I could put my hand over the sink and it could easily span the diameter. The light in the toilet/shower part of the bathroom was pretty dim, but they do have one of those timed heated lights to turn on if you'd like. The features in the room itself included a nicely sized mini-fridge, a flat-screen TV with plenty of channels (including many HBO channels, too), and a heater. The heat system is a radiator, and although it has an ""auto""/""manual""/""off"" switch, when it turns on to heat up the room, it made a loud clanking noise that all of us who have ever had radiators and gas heat are very familiar with. We would keep the heat on during the day while we were out and shut it off at night. The room was very very comfy (not cold at all) even when it was below freezing outside. The pool and fitness area is one of the best I've ever been to at a hotel. The pool has multiple lanes for swimming laps and goes from 3 feet to 8 feet deep. It isn't very cold, so in the winter (when we were there) it was very refreshing. There is also a lifeguard on staff, which many hotels don't have. There is a dry sauna, but no hot tub. The fitness room has a number of cardio machines, weight equipment, mats, and stability balls, along with TVs. The hotel has free continental breakfast on weekday mornings, a restaurant on the first floor (although it was being renovated during my stay), and a free shuttle bus that takes you all the way up Michigan Ave to downtown (by the John Hancock Tower, etc.). We didn't use the shuttle because location of the hotel is fantastic. There are lots of bars in the area, a few restaurants, but when we wanted to go to any of the touristy stuff (Millenium Park, Art Institute, Chinatown) we would just walk. We even walked from the hotel all the way downtown and then to Navy Pier! It was a pretty long walk, but that's city life for you! And if walking isn't your thing, there are a number of subway and Metra light rail stops nearby. It took us 5 minutes to walk to a Metra light rail stop to go south to the Museum of Science and Industry. So easy! My boyfriend and I definitely want to go back to Chicago again, and I expect we'll stay at the Essex Inn upon our return!";4;3;0;0;N;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

I liked the location.  Right on Michigan within reasonable (to my wife and I) walking distances to the museums and loop.  Slightly out of the way for walking to anywhere much north like the Mag Mile or Navy Pier. The rooms were reasonably sized.  They were an odd mixture of very new and modern very old barely maintained fixtures from when the hotel was built in the 60s.  For example, new marble sink counter and newer white bathroom tile with a bathroom door that must have had 12 coats of paint on it. The wireless Internet was pretty annoying.  You had to get a pass code from the front desk for every 24 hour use.  I wish I could have just paid for wireless the entire stay. One day housekeeping took our door tag and I had to get a new one from the front desk.  Another day, our neighbor across the hall took it.   The staff at the front desk was always courteous and willing to help. We stayed for a week and had to play an interesting game of musical rooms.  Before flying out, my wife called to confirm that we'd have our requested king-sized bed.  After we checked in and got into our room, we discovered...two full-sized beds.  We complained and they put us into a very nice corner room with a queen.   We would have loved to have stayed there but there was an incredible banging of pipes, presumably due to the cold weather fighting with the heating.  To get a feel for how this sounded, take a metal pot and start tapping it with a spoon increasingly harder for about 2 minutes.  Stop for 10 minutes.  Repeat.  Imagine sleeping under these conditions.  One desk member acted surprised and another said, ""Yeah, I've heard of people having problems in the corner rooms"". There was no way we could sleep in there another night so we got yet another room but since it was the weekend, all they had were rooms with twin beds.  Given that we couldn't sleep in the other room, we had no choice but were told that the next day they'd have rooms available with king-sized beds. Sure enough they did.  Except the lights on the bed did not work and the toilet seat would not stay up.  At this point I was tired of the moving and wasn't bother by peeing sitting down for the rest of my stay. For a one or two night stay, I wouldn't have any problems returning.  But for any longer, forget it.";3;2;0;1;N;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

9/21/2010;SBsxsK3smOEs94Zctup;mTXT5aVQZgHw18lEtFWORA;"This hotel was great. The bellman, Javier, was excellent too! He let us know where to get great pizza (expect a review sometime later), great bars around town, and how to get around the city. First, to start off with a few complaints, the bathroom was ridiculously small. I know if some of my friends would have been with me, there is no way they could have shut the door without standing in the shower to do so. But, not a big problem. Second, the pool and sauna closes at 10pm, that sucked, especially since it seemed like such a great idea after drinking at a football game all day. Now onto the good stuff, there is a mini fridge (empty) in your room! I don't know why more hotels don't understand that I want to keep my own things in my fridge, I don't want to buy your overpriced snickers bars or one ounce shots of liquor, when I can buy something at the local 7-11 for a third of the price! Next, the view was incredible! My friend and I could see as far as we wanted onto Lake Michigan (we were on the 9th floor), we could see Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. The view was worth the price (about $150 after taxes and fees per night). The bed wasn't the greatest bed, but it wasn't horrible either. My last complaint, because it felt like they were just trying to charge us a few extra bucks, was to hold our bags Sunday after we checked out but before our plane left, they charged us a few dollars. I thought that was cheap, when we would have just tipped the Bellman instead (but we decided to, only because it was Javier though)! Regarding the price - our friends on the trip told us they got the W. Chicago for $100 the week before they left, when we booked two to three weeks ahead of time and paid $150 per night. I looked at the W. and it was definitely nicer, so that was kind of a let down, but not the end of the world.";4;1;0;0;N;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

The hotel was very nice and clean. I loved the way the halls are decorated. They had this modern, but classic look to it. The rooms are cool as well. The room kind of reminded me of something I saw on that tv show trading spaces. There are a couple of drawbacks to this hotel- The Internet- its like a massive deadzone when you enter this place. I have 5 bars, but yet my Internet isn't moving. I feel as if they are blocking Internet signals here to make you purchase their Internet ( Which is awful.  I'm used to Comcast Internet hunty. The Allerton charges 10 bucks a day for dial up speed Internet. # GurlBye  There is also a mini bar, but you'd be crazier than hell to use it. You should just reach into your wallet,  pull out money and light it on fire. That's how much of a waste of money it is.

The drinks and appetizers were fine, but the experience was so negative that if the hotel was trying to use the promotion to stimulate business and bring awareness to the hotel, it was a total disaster. We waited 20 minutes and I then walked to the bar to ask for service. I was told to take a seat and someone would be there shortly. It became clear that the server was so surly because he was one of only 2 people working the entire bar area, and he had to actually go behind the bar and make the drinks after taking the orders. Luckily, he had a busman who retrieved the food orders and brought them to the table so the bartender/server didn't have to do that. It was embarrasssing looking around the room at other patrons waiting for service, and some who left after a period of time and simply abandoned their coupon, rather than waiting the time it took to be served. Unfortunately, the management of the hotel was so inept as to allow this situation to occur. With a promotion in effect, one would think they would have staffed the room adequately to take are of the traffic brought in by the coupon. They set the hotel back for some time with this sorry show of ineptitude, and if they don't emerge from their current bankruptcy situation, I won't be surprised, but I will be disappointed, because it is a nice space and could do well if properly managed.";2;1;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Front desk staff was extremely friendly and upgraded my room to a corner room at no extra cost. Our room was clean and comfy, everything to hope for. I'm sure if we were larger people or had 3 or more staying in the room it would have felt cramped (especially w/ the bathroom) but we're not so it was perfect. Bed's were comfortable and the room had several windows to enjoy the city views; also included in the rooms: 42in LCD TV, iPod dock alarm clock, & safe The property had a surprisingly spacious gym on the top floor (take elevator all the way up and then use the staircase to the next highest floor... looks a bit sketchy) with great views of the Water Tower. The gym had several TV's and cardio machines for guest use, also towels & water. Probably the only thing that's a downer are the tiny & slow elevators, figures since it's an old classic hotel that's been heavily updated & remodeled. Tips: walk over to the Avenue hotel next door to hail a taxi during busy times... a lot quicker. Buy your own water for the room at Walgreen's on the next block since the tiny Vos water's in the in-room fridge cost $5.

It's downtown Chicago, though, so I've come to expect it by now and usually don't mind. It's in a really great location if you want to be on Michigan Avenue... great people watching, good place to walk around, and shopping madness everywhere you look. There's also a restaurant and lounge with a nice bar that I wish I could've checked out! The staff was pretty friendly when I checked in and I headed to my room on the 11th floor. Let's just say I was shocked when I walked in... it was so small! Smaller than my bedroom in my apartment. Like... if I put the ironing board out, I couldn't really get anywhere. The bed was nice and the TV on the wall was big, and the bathroom was modern and impressive as well. This is pretty random but while I was in the shower (with glass doors), I could see through the window all down Michigan. Kinda cool! I noticed a spider web on the wall which was easy to spot in the clean, shiny bathroom, but I forgot about it... until later that night when I saw a spider crawling on it. SO gross... try getting a good night's sleep after that if you're someone who's as afraid of spiders as I am! Couple other things I wasn't a fan of: -No room service menu in my room even though there was supposed to be... had to look online. -Internet is $9.95 a day which didn't shock me (I've seen much worse in hotels) but it made me log in and accept the charge every time I opened my computer. -My breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, fruit, coffee) was $52. I almost fainted when I saw that on my bill. -To valet your car overnight it's $50. FIFTY DOLLARS. Seriously? No matter how great the city is, I'm always going to think that's ridiculous. My car was with valet for eight hours overnight, and again, it was $50. -No cell phone reception in my room... text messages wouldn't even go through. -If anyone from the hotel is reading this, there's a drop of blood on the bathroom curtains in room 1108. I understand these hotels are designed for people with a lot of cash, but does that really make it right to charge so much for everything? I probably won't stay here again even though there were a few positives... I just feel like there are a lot better options at a similar price!

This hotel is located on the mile, which put us in the middle of the action, shopping, and walking distance to just about everything we needed. Heck, with all the hundreds of Starbucks they had, I was within walking distance to two Panera Breads, which was awesome! LOL. We stayed here just this past weekend for my birthday. We stayed from Thursday - Sunday. The hotel is cutesy/boutiquish to me, which isn't bad. It is a very old building with lots of character and charm. The only thing(s) I wouldn't say I did not like, but did not appeal to me, were the room sizes, cost for overnight parking ($50 per overnight stay), paying for the internet, and the cramp elevators and hallways. Now keep in mind that our room was on the 13th floor, so at any time I was waiting on the big-wheel and child to ride down saying ""redrum"", Ha, ha ha.  But those are just things that were not appealing to me. The hotel was clean, housekeeping cleaned and made the bed daily, and the staff was so nice and courteous.  I do prefer rooms with microwaves and fridges, which this room did not have.   If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck, I think you should keep looking because for most of the amenities, you have to pay for them here. BF had his Sprint wireless jack, so he did not have to purchase the internet package. It reminded me so much of a cruise, being that everything costs!!! Yes it's downtown Chi-town, but it isn't Vegas, LOL. So I guess that is why the high costs. Would I be back? Naw..I'm sure I can find something else with a bit more.

I spoke with a manager who said they'd waive the internet fee, but sure enough, when I received my bill under the door I'd been charged for internet.  So had to wait in line at the front desk to get adjusted before leaving. I ordered room service the first night - an Asian chicken salad - and the chicken was so dry I had to push aside and just eat the lettuce.  For $26, it was pretty gross and disappointing.   Finally, the maid service barely cleaned the room; the bed was made but that was about it.  In fact, I'd left my curling iron on by accident and they didn't even turn it off, let alone unplug it, so when I got home that night it had burned through a bottle of lotion.  I was surprised such little attention was paid to detail here.  Despite the convenient location, I would not recommend this hotel nor would I choose to stay here again.";2;0;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

WiFI is free in the lobby area but $9 per day if you use it from your room. Extortionate to say the least. Even if you use a phone card to make an international call, as soon as you are connected, there is an outrageous $1.50 on your bill. Lastly, if you stay long and need laundry done, it is $8 per shirt! On the brighter side, the staff is good and professional. When I told them about the breakfast at check out, they offered me a free breakfast which is nice but it also made me think about the variety. I also complained about the breakfast in twitter which means they follow social media, also positive. The location of the hotel is excellent and the jazz they play at all times at reception is heart warming. What is really funny about this hotel is that British Airways crew stays here.

I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago for a romantic weekend in the city. I checked in Friday night, and checked out Sunday morning. My fiance got a Groupon, so we got a suite, free wifi, and two vouchers for two glasses of wine (4 glasses total). The hotel is very nice. It's location is on the Mag Mile, so it's a perfect stop for shoppers. The room was very clean and spacious. I get really paranoid when something doesn't feel clean, but this place put me at ease. I didn't worry about feeling dirty. The suite included a separate living room connected to the bathroom and bedroom. It makes the room more intimate. The room is very modern considering it's a very old building. The Allerton has been around since Al Capone was roaming the mean streets of Chicago. I did read about their renovation, so I could see and feel the newness of the hotel. The lobby and bar is on the second floor. The only complaint I have with their bar area is that it's so hot. The open fireplace makes the area so warm and stuffy. The bar is tiny, only a couple of couches and chairs. The second floor exudes modern luxury. I wished they kept more remnants of the old building. I love historical places, and I felt like it lost that touch in here. The second floor of this hotel knocked off a star. I personally did not have any issues with the staff at the hotel. Everyone seems to be hospitable. No complaints there! Overall, this was a fun place to stay.

No one ever called. Eventually--after a about 30 min, some  towels came. The second night I inspected the bed a little more closely. The mattress covers are made out of some sort of woven plastic, and a handful of the fibers stick through the sheet---they are so sharp they stick right through the sheet. The effect is like sleeping on a tack. Other issues---tiny/slow elevators.  No coffee maker in the room, so all the guests are going to the lobby in the AM for coffee, then waiting in lines to get back on elevators.

They are literally only a couple of blocks away.  Of course, my wife loved the fact that they were smack center of Miracle Mile where all the boutique stores are. Overall the hotel was clean and modern chic.  It is apparent that it is an older building that has gone through some renovation.  But this adds to a bit of its charm, including the funny smelling elevator. Only elevators that are over 50 years old can have that distinct smell - hard to describe, but you'll know it when you smell it. The room was a lot larger than what one would expect from a hotel situated in the heart of the city.  There was more than enough space to prevent us from feeling claustrophobic.  I have stayed at some boutique hotels that were so cramped that you couldn't lift your hands to shampoo in the shower and hit my head on the wall trying to get off the toilet (really!).  The fitness center is very large with equipment that have individual video screens and they provide you with disposable headphones as well.  Chilled towels are also available so you can cool down after a hard workout.  The only minus I found was the industrial flush toilets in the bathrooms - you'll know what I mean when you see it.  It is not the kind that has the lever on the tank, but the one that is on the water pipe.

Unfortunately, that's where the good things end.  The Allerton is a very old hotel and it shows.  The elevators are teeny, teeny, tiny and are comically inadequate to service a hotel of this size.  The bedroom furniture is quite old and there's NO DRAWERS in the rooms to put your stuff.  There's no BATHROOM COUNTER or anywhere else to put your toothbrush, etc.  There's just a free standings sink.  Even that sucks because the edges of it are slanted so if you try to balance anything on it, it just slides into the sink! I can't complain too much because we got a good rate on Priceline.  I do not at all agree that the Allerton deserves it's 3.5 star status that Priceline assigns it.  The excellent location is the only reason I'll give 2 stars versus 1.";2;1;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I was driving a rental car and had side swiped another vehicle leaving a long white scratch on the uninsured rental vehicle. What a bummer! The valet sensed my distress and spent over 15 minutes, with the help of the hotel manager, buffing out the scratch. Mind you, they had no involvement in the prior scrape!

Our flight+hotel only for 300 dollars for the weekend? Omg, why not?? Allerton has great location. 701 N. Michigan Ave, right across from the Zara. A girl's best dream ever. But man, that hotel is small and old. The second floor is nice- they have a nice ""M"" lounge, complete with drinks and food. The tiny elevators took us up to our room and we entered. The room was okay. Came with a tv, desk, fridge, full size bed, and bathroom. It was just.... not that great. I mean, I've stayed (and lived) in much much worse, but the pictures are sure deceiving. It was a pretty old- the doors to the closet, the carpet, the windows, and the BATHROOM. The toilet had one of those flush handles you see in public bathrooms. You know, the ones where you use your foot to step on it to flush? The heavy duty ones? Omg. And there was no counterspace! I also wished they have provided amenities besides the shampoo and conditioner and soap. Like...some lotion? I was ready to give Allerton three stars until I saw what housekeeping did. Okay, they did not give us any washcloths. Big deal (not really). But OUR TOOTHBRUSHES. We had put our toothbrushes in the cups (as we usually do). We come back to the room Saturday night, to find our toothbrushes not in their cup but LYING in the bathroom. They were behind the bathroom faucet. EWWWWWWWW!! I'm not a germaphobe, but REALLY?!! Who KNOWS where those toothbrushes have been or where they have touched!! Disgusting. BLEH. I rinsed my in hot water for about a minute before sticking it in my mouth. Overall, good location, and it's fine. But if you're looking to pamper yourself? No way. Bad housekeeping will keep me far away from this place again.";2;1;0;1;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Its a decent 3 trying very very hard to climb the ladder with trendy decor and branding but failing miserably due to a mismanagement and staff that has not been trained in what good service is. -When I arrived the valet kid literally dragged my camera case carrying over $20,000 worth of gear ( i am a professional)  across the floor and literally tossed it into the corner i specified he leave it. He couldnt pick it up to carry it properly but he could throw it ?? - I was coming in and out each day with large bags of camera equipment. There is a tall, skinny caucasian boy with brown hair at the front door bellman station who I am convinced is on facebook/waching movies on the computer up there all day long. He would literally watch me struggle through the heavy glass door with my gear day in and day out without moving a muscle. Other bellmen would help me carry it to the elevator but not this kid.... -I have diabetes and my shakes were removed from the mini-bar and thrown out. He obviously didnt know of my condition, but either way, UNACCEPTABLE. -the base rate internet plan (9.95/day) is so slow it was unusable. Upgraded to the 14.95/day plan which was enough to not have to wait for pages to load but not fast enough for me to do my work which requires uploading and downloading of photographs/video. The 19.95 plan was better, but CUT OUT ... literally stopped working completely once an hour or so, rendering it totally unsable. I told the Manager Carlos about all of this and he seemed sympathetic. I was booked to return this month, and he took off my internet charges, upgraded my room for my next stay, and promised a free fridge in my room. I didnt write a bad review and kept my week long reservation for this month thinking maybe this bad run was a fluke. I just called there to change my reservation and extend by one day. It took over 30 minutes and 4 seperate phone calls.. The reservationist was unhelpful and RUDE, transferred me back to the operator, who then transferred me again to some voiemail for reservations instructing me to leave a message?? C'mon....after literally at least transfers back and forth and repeating myself over and over for 22 minutes... No one seemed able to open or change my reservation and she insisted I booked it via a travel agent. Nope... booked direct thru their own website. I finally gave up with the attitude and ineptitude of the reservationists who literally REFUSED to transfer me to a manager. Took me another TWO MORE CALLS to get to the Concierge (first time i was transfered to a voicemail again)... finally where Lewis was helpful and apologetic. I remember him from the last time when i helped me and he is great... warm, welcoming.. one of the two (the other being Carlos) who seemed to give a sh*t about their jobs. This place is hit or miss. There are a couple gems in the staff but expect a rude, uncourteous, and downright pathetic experience with anyone else you deal with in the hotel, particularly on the phone. BOTTOM LINE THINGS TO EXPECT: - a small room with small windows so very little light - a tiny bathroom with no products (no lotion? ) and ZERO counterspace. Literally there is a 5inch metal ledge which was too small to accomodate my  makeup case. - pathetic service from everyone in the hotel except those at the top. (bellmen, valet, reservationists etc) - great location at a very cheap rate.... but you get what you pay for I guess... I'm sorry Allerton. I gave you another chance... I would not have written all of this had your phone staff not just wasted 45 mins of my day giving me attitude, hanging up on me, and telling me in 20 different ways they couldnt help.";1;1;0;1;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Double bed, yes, and room cozy but not too small.  Bathroom much larger than expected with nice variegated tile.  Wireless internet in room $10 for a ""lite"" option that provides quite speedy service, though not hardy enough to stream Netflix.  You can upgrade for $5 or $10 additional. Even if you get the fastest option, the total bill for this location ($75 room + $10 internet + $11 tax = $94) on Michigan Avenue is quite a bargain in my book. Solid wood bedroom door to the hallway still permitted me to hear conversations as people walked by, but I was close to the elevator and for the most part my stay was very quiet until my second night's neighbors arrived.  I could hear a decent amount of conversing through the shared wall. Elevators are numerous and very fast.  Five blocks from the Chicago/State stop on the blue line, so you are merely a 45 minute, $2.50 train ride from O'Hare. Exercise room is huge and adequate. Very nice pre-cor elliptical machines and several treadmills-- all equipped with personal TVs.  No pool, but for less than $100 a night, Westin Workout, eat your heart out! I really felt like I was getting away with something every time I strolled out into Michigan Avenue.  I found the staff very pleasant.  I was very pleasantly surprised and glad I took this chance, and would happily stay here again.  Obviously not a luxury hotel, but it not a budget hotel either.  It is more than adequate.  The value combined with the facilities easily affords a 3 out of 5 recommendation and I'm inclined to give it 4.";4;1;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

They were doing some renovation downtstairs when we visited, so the entrance and elevators were a bit awkward.  Valet lot is across the street and took forever.

And to the folks who complain about the internet fees, room service prices, etc.:  There are no surprises.  All you need to do is a little reading either before you book or when you arrive to your room.  Everything is clearly stated in the hotel information book in your room.  If something is unclear, ask!  We are very laid-back guys and I have had a difficult time understanding the things some people choose to complain about.  The only conclusion I can arrive to is that some people are simply just picky, high-maintenance whiners.  If you expected the Ritz-Carlton, then you should pay many times what the Allerton charges for its lovely accomodations in an excellent location and spare everyone your grief in the process.  We had a wonderful time in Chicago and would stay at the Allerton again, no questions asked.";5;0;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

Great location - right in the center / walking distance of shopping, movie theatres, parks, museums, and restaurants.  For the more indie/local neighborhoods and bars though, you will likely need a cab. Great service, very polite and helpful. Really pretty on the inside - marble, and very cute restaurant and bar.  The place has character - it's not one of those generic, boring eyesores that make me sick. Our room - kind of small, but not uncomfortably so. Bathroom - nice shower / good water pressure.  No bathtub - but I think  that in the larger rooms, that may not be the case.  L'Occitane brand (and great smelling) shower products.

The rooms come with an i-pod docking station so you can play your music on speakers / charge it - great perk! Try not to use the bathroom at night if you're sharing a room - the toilet's flush is loud enough to wake the dead. Nice gym with little flat screen TVs on most of their equipment. I think that this hotel generally is expensive, but I went through Orbitz, booked it as a package with my flight, and only paid around $260 for 3 nights...if you split that with who you're staying with, it's a steal.

I wish they had more amenities on top of the basics - more products, like lotion in addition to shampoo and conditioner and bar soap.  Some fridge room would be nice.  They should also keep a closer eye to detail - my bathroom faucet had a missing piece that looked like it broke off.  The bed and the room overall looked clean except for a random blood stain on my sheet.  I think every hotel that charges for internet is just ripping you off a little bit.  it's almost like charging you for potable water.  They do it because they can but they really shouldn't given this day and age where free wifi is not only welcome but a required amenity - charging for it is just like throwing away customer goodwill.   Breakfast in bed was good - but pricey - I guess that's what you should expect from a hotel.

The location is perfect; the lobby, lounge, and bedrooms are very classy, and the beds are super-comfortable.  However, given how expensive everything seemed, I was disappointed with the amenities. Even budget chains will often provide free cable TV, wifi, and continental breakfast service, but I was faced with the following: a) WiFi is free in the lobby, but $10/day surcharge in your room. What a ripoff.  Obviously they have it wired already, so I feel they're being malicious in asking us to pay for it.  I was able to pull a usable open signal from the hotel next door. b) No TV.  They advertise ""free cable TV"" in every room but mine sure didn't have any. Instead you have a fancy LCDtv with a truly crappy hotel-installed interface, where everything is pay-per-view.  Want to watch a recent episode of TV?  You only have a few options.  I chose 30 Rock... and was asked to pay $5 to watch a recent episode.  What a ripoff.  You are being asked to pay for what is basically Hulu.  There are movies for ~$15 of course, but that is pretty standard. There is a laughable ""free"" section on the menu but it consists of crud that appears to be free videos from the internet.  One had Tom Arnold, one was called ""Naked Wine"" and featured naked wine reviews. Except the woman wasn't attractive... or naked (it shows from the shoulders up). WTF Allerton, I feel you are just TRYING to be jerks. Plus originally the TV wouldn't turn on; then there was a period when it would keep turning itself back on. c) No breakfast, not even tea.  Ok, so I didn't care about the breakfast. It's just an observation.  I REALLY would have liked some tea though.  In the morning they had coffee in the lobby, but NO TEA!  Maybe this is a midwest bias that I can't understand, coming from California. d) As others have mentioned, there is no storage space.  Closet is a decent sized but you'll have no dressers to keep your clothes. So I was pretty disappointed with the place, until I looked up the prices. Turns out to be somewhat of a budget hotel: $100-150/night for a single queen or double full room, which is pretty good actually.  I was forced to reevaluate in light of this.  I'd say that this is a great place to stay if you want to feel like you're staying in a luxury hotel but paying economy prices.  Located right on the Magnificent Mile, it doesn't get much better.  Just try to get a room on the upper floors, to enjoy the view.";3;1;1;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

My husband and I were married on 09-10-11 and we had our reception at the Allerton Hotel on the 23rd floor in the Tip Top Tap room. What a Beautiful space with stunning views, delicious food, and Exceptional service! Would do it all again, at the Allerton, and wouldn't change a thing! The hotel is filled with charm and possess a true Chicago vibe. As soon as you arrive you are greeted by an attentive valet staff and helpful doormen. The front desk staff was a little slow, but cheerful nonetheless. The lobby bar is filled with plush seating and Delicious drinks...all of this before you're in the unique hotel rooms. The suites we were given, as well as our parents, were absolutely amazing! And Huge..a gigantic bathroom (large enough to have three bridesmaids admiring themselves in the mirror at the same time), a king size bed in a bedroom also containing a couch, flat screen, and lounge chair..attached to the bedroom was the entertaining space with another couch, two chairs, mini bar, tv, and desk. Not to mention the complimentary champagne and fresh fruit sent to the room:) The evening of our  reception was indescribable! The reception space was so elegantly set-up with a dance floor large enough to accommodate all of our 125 guests with ease. The bartenders were ""on their game"", the service staff was exceptional and the head server, bar manager, and catering manager are phenomenal..consistently checking on us and offering to retrieve anything we may need. Booking our wedding at such a historical landmark was what drew us to the Allerton but working with their magnificent staff is what provided us with that ""Wow"" factor. All of our friends and family are still raving to us about the Allerton and so we wanted to pass the beauty of our experience on to other people considering the Allerton for their event. We believe there is no competition and no better choice. We give the Allerton five stars for decor, location, food, drink, service, and overall experience. The Allerton= Pure Satisfaction.";5;2;0;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

A veritable nerd's delight. I was there for a training seminar and had a discount rate of around $200 a night, which I felt was reasonable for the level of luxury this hotel offers. I noticed the web rate is like $400-500 a night, which would have been a travesty. I would say this is a 3 star hotel. The entire hotel is small in stature. The rooms are very small. Being one person I thought I would be fine but I noticed I was bumping into things and stepping on things on the floor all the time. Now I know how small animals feel in a cage. The lobby is very small as well, and finally to punctuate the smallness of it all, the elevators were miniature and could maybe hold 4 people comfortably. The rooms are fairly new decor wise. The bathroom was decorated nicely but the area around the shower was starting to show its age in terms of dirty grout and stains. The staff is fairly friendly and the front desk was very fast with the check in and check out. The bellhop was fairly overwhelmed in the late afternoon with the bag check and took a bit of time to get your bags. Would I stay here again? For $200 yes. Anything higher and you'd be better off at the Embassy Suites or Courtyard.";3;0;1;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I'm staying three nights here and it is one of the best hotel experiences I've had (even compared to Four Seasons & the Ritz).  The hotel is a bit smaller than the chain hotels, but has oh so much more style and glamour! It blends hip and history all into one-- what a unique boutique hotel should be! The service is excellent, from the reservations team to the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeping, waitstaff- you name it.  I'm not going to say that there haven't been minor mistakes- like I had to call twice to change my reservation, etc.  But overall, the attitude is consistently caring, professional, and there is attention to detail everywhere. Main lobby and lounge area are very inviting- nice relaxing space to meet up with friends/colleagues or just surf the net on your laptop.  The rooms are fresh, upbeat, modern, extremely clean, and very quiet.  I was upgraded to a suite (even though I was paying a corporate rate-- nice!) It has a stylish sofa/hideaway bed with a work area and plasma TV.  The bedroom has a large king bed (surprisingly comfortable- NOT hard or hollow like most hotel beds), a beautiful large floor length mirror, make up table, another plasma TV and a bathroom in floor-to-ceiling marble. Downtown Chicago hotels are not cheap-  You may be able to get this between $150 - $209 if you book ahead and stay multiple nights and use corporate or AAA rates.  This is definitely a great value- it really feels like a small luxury hotel without the big name.";5;0;1;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

After that, it starts to go downhill a little bit. I should have been forewarned when I walked down the 3' wide hallways, but man, the rooms are tiny (and I mean TINY). Upon walking into your room, you pretty much fall into your bed. Eep! They had large 40"" flat screen TVs in every room, which would be super awesome...if they had cable.  Sorry guys, but the local news in HD really doesn't do it for me. The hotel has a pretty small fitness center on the top floor, with a couple of ellipticals, treadmills, and free weights. There's no free wi-fi (ACK!). Wi-fi is $9/day for 0.5Mb/sec, and $19.99/day for 1.5Mb/sec. Yuck. Some pluses were the iPod alarm clock, free morning coffee and USA Today newspaper, super plushy pillows, and Bath & Body works shampoo/conditioner.

The room was beyond small...my daughter and I could barely squeeze by one another in the bathroom and it was laid out very odd, didn't allow for much movement at all. The beds however, were divine!  Sank into down pillows every night that were just heavenly...perfect when you've been running all over Chicagoland all day and night! Great location, right down the street from Water Tower, although the ER at Northwestern and the sirens got a bit old after a while. Elevators were definitely a challenge, but my daughter and I in good fun enjoyed chatting up people and trying to figure out which one went where.  The elevators, like the rooms, were totally small and cramped, made for some interesting drunken conversations! Avoid the restaurant!  We had their $19 brunch and pretty much every item was stone cold The Bell Staff, in a word, astounding...hilarious...helpful...sarcastic...­since we were there for so long, we got to know many of them and we'd head out into the night hearing them warn us about no calls from the police to come pick us up or for us to behave.  Always friendly, got cabs for us immediately, great suggestions for places to hang out...they made the stay fun...even if they couldn't believe we walked all over downtown, from Navy Pier to Huron 'on purpose'. All in all, a nice stay, but I will stay some place different next time I think.  For the money, I am not sure its worth the cons...its almost a tie with the pros.";2;0;1;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

We stayed at the Allerton on a holiday weekend and got an amazing deal on Hotwire. (I paid more per night to stay in a dingy motel in Santa Monica, but that is an entirely different review.) I read the Yelp reviews before I came and was bracing for the worst-mainly that I would be sleeping in a closet, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We stayed in the Standard room, which I think is their smallest room. It has a full sized bed, and a tiny bathroom (so two people can't get ready at once) but was otherwise spacious and clean. The fitness center was also well equipped with new treadmills, ellipticals, weights and a TVs on all the equipment. The location is also in the middle of everything. A stay at the Four Seasons it is not, but for the price, it really can't be beat. All in all, I think this is a great boutique hotel that has been renovated quite nicely and I would definitely stay here again. I am taking away one star because of two things: 1) the elevators are the SLOWEST most awful elevators ever. I know this is beyond management's control since it is an old building and they probably had to work with the existing framework, but OH MY GOD. Don't stay here if you anticipate being in a hurry at any point during your stay.

All boutique hotels have small rooms so we were expecting the room so to be small but these were PINT SIZE. The double rooms have two FULL SIZE BEDS, not queens . If you plan on having more than five in a room, a double room will not accommodate a cot without creating a fire hazard, so you'll have to go with a jr. suite. The people at the front desk realized our situation and were nice enough to upgrade our room to a jr. suite at no extra charge. Sink had a crack in it and there are just signs of wear and tear everywhere in this hotel overall that could use a little TLC. Nevertheless, our stay was comfortable and you really can't beat the location. It is right off Michigan Avenue and walking distance to almost anything and everything you want to see downtown. The bellhops downstairs were very friendly. Storing our luggage after check-out and arranging for a van cab to the airport were no problem.

If the room first selected is not to your liking, ask again, I did. Finding my 'suite' in a dark corridor, weird layout and not at all safe feeling. I asked to move, and front desk found a much better room, same rate that worked. Every person I dealt with was kind, empathetic, and willing to beyond to make my experience better.

If we had known that, we wouldn't have gotten room service, which totaled about $75 for our 5-day stay.  Nothing in our room indicated that there was free coffee in the hotel, which I felt should have been very clear.  One evening, we also asked the hotel if there was a microwave we could use to warm up some leftover food from the night before to save money, and they acted like that was an absurd request.

We had two full size beds. The rooms were pretty small, but I expected it from all the reviews I read, so it wasn't a big deal for us. Our other 2 friends stayed in a ""petite"" room with one bed and that room was TINY! On our second night, we encountered a rather disturbing issue with our room.  We left a window open to ""air out"" while we were out touring the city. When we came back, we noticed that there were tiny bugs flying on the ceiling. The service guy came to spray the room and suggested we switch rooms due to the smell of bug spray and dead bugs that fell on our sheets and carpet. I called management but the hotel was all sold out. He offered to re-clean our room, change the sheets, etc while we were out for the night and he would comp the room for the night and switch us to a suite the next day. Since that was our only option, and since it was our fault for leaving the window open after a storm, we accepted. What bothered me was when the housekeeping manager called the room, she was so rude and told me that her department was leaving for the night and would not be able to clean our room if we were not out in the next few minutes. I told her that when housekeeping came to our room, I asked if it was ok if we called when we left in about 30 minutes and housekeeping kindly said that it was not a problem. The housekeeping manager rudely said, ""that's not true.""  How is SHE going to tell ME about what was said in a conversation between me and another housekeeper??!!  RUDE. All she had to do was tell me that her department closes in 45 minutes and we need to be out so they can clean the room. Period. We would've been happy to leave to accomodate them. My friends and I gathered our stuff to our other friend's tiny room to finish getting ready so that housekeeping could clean our room. The next day we were upgraded to a really beautiful suite. All in all, the hotel was clean and in a great location. The elevators were somewhat slow but not a big deal. I think the longest we waited was 5 minutes. Majority of the staff was friendly and helpful. Checking in (late) and checking out were quick and easy. Complimentary coffee in the lounge area was delicious. Price was reasonable; we got a great deal online and my other friend got great tips on how to get a cheaper deal when she called to reserve a room for herself and her boyfriend.

Since my company booked the seminar, I had a single room, that was truly meant for a single, but my husband came with me.  The room was very nice, well appointed with nice linens, bathroom supplies from L'Occitane, and since the room was meant to be part of a suite, set back from the main hall.  But it was SMALL!  The foot of the bed was only inches away from the wall, so in order to get out of bed, I had to climb over my husband to get to the bathroom.   It was great that the room had an Ipod Home so I could charge my Ipod and listen to my music. There was a problem with my bill that was unforeseen.  My company paid for my room with the corporate credit card, but the hotel couldn't find the folio with information.  The room was charged to my account, and only when I returned home was everything cleared. The Allerton had done a conversion on their accounting system two days before, and my information was lost.   I would stay at the Allerton again if only for the location,.  The hotel and staff were wonderful.  Thank you.";4;0;1;0;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
8/24/2009;HcIh7dgXfuhDcf27JqMgow;mpJpwe-qkA3sv0zNjx0JOw;"I was in the city with my significant other to visit a friend and celebrate my birthday and after doing a little research on Expedia we decided to try out the Allerton.  I am SO glad we did.  We were put in a very nice, unique room that looked right out over Michigan Ave. and the lake. The room was ""unique"" in that rather than being square and wide it was long and narrow, which I had no problem with.  Narrow and on the small side is how most of the hotel spaces are constructed (particularly the elevators) and I can see how, as some posters have complained, a standard room may be smallish and the narrow hallways and elevators were annoying (especially at check out time when everyone is using them all at once.)  However, it is not a secret that this is an old hotel.  If you don't appreciate the history, age and building structure that go along with an older building stay someplace else.  Everything about our stay was A+.  Friendly staff, super comfy bed and linens, a bathroom stocked with L'Occitane bath products and room service that was delicious and not priced at heart stopping rates. (We had a delicious full breakfast that cost no more than we would have paid at any standard restaurant on Michigan Ave.)  You can't beat the location, the room price was extremely reasonable for the area and we will definitely be back again!";5;2;2;2;N;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

I know she was just trying to do her job, but when I questioned the large amount she said there was nothing she could do. One of her co-workers overheard our discussion, came over and said to just put a $50 hold for the entire stay. Amanda's eyes lit up and said, ""what if something happens""? Um, hello, I'm standing right in front of you! Her very nice co-worker said it was fine, helped her set it up and walked away. At that point Amanda was PISSED!!! I asked for two keys, she just glared at me and angrily grabbed another key. I went up to my room and that was it. I did t see Miss By The Book Amanda until I was checking out. I understand there are rules, but c'mon a $250 hold on my debit card, which will take 7-10 days to fall off- I don't think so. Other than that issue, our stay at the Avenue was fine. The water pressure was pretty good and when the shower wouldn't drain, they fixed it immediately. Despite Amanda, I'd stay there again.";4;1;1;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

9/7/2011;oujqoWXEWbwSWwESAWWxlw;znn_qM_xKaSqu_kNgzGmeA;"First, the good. Great location. So close to everything downtown. Staff was friendly enough. The valet is $40 per night, but honestly, the self park garages around the area charge the same for 24 hours, so it's really the going rate. It just seems like a circus in the valet area, so you're almost better off parking across the street at the self park. Now, the bad. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which would go for around $340 per night on the weekend, but we did not pay full price. When you see a rate like that, you expect a great quality stay, but not in this case. The light switch covers were falling off in several places throughout our room. The flat screen T.V. was blurry (odd!). The Wi-Fi continuously disconnected. The shower had no water pressure (looked like it needed a good dip in CLR) and the towel rack was hung inside the shower? The coffee maker had an old coffee pod in it from a previous guest. Yuck. Also, out of 6 packages of coffee, 5 were decaf. Really? The walls were really thin. Complete conversations could be heard through them. The doors did not close without some muscle. The wait for the elevator (and there were 3 of them) was really long. We were not impressed. We had stayed at the Fairfield Inn about a block away a few years back, and seriously, it was far cleaner and better maintained. And about half the price. A few other things happened that were beyond the control of the hotel, but they were still annoying. We had some smokers on our floor, and after a call to the front desk, security came and told them it was a non-smoking hotel. Thankfully, that seemed to do the trick. But it was hours before the smell dissipated. Also, a dog peed in the elevator right as we were getting on. But, who wants to get back out and wait who knows how long for another one? Again, not the fault of the hotel, but when so many other things were bad, it just added to the negative vibe. I think there are many hotels in that area that are cheaper and better maintained. Crowne Plaza definitely needs to take a close look at housekeeping and maintenance. I would not recommend this hotel.";2;4;0;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

Spent four days here, and the service was impeccable; from check-in time to the minute we left the place, every single thing was perfect. I made reservations a month in advance, and when I received my confirmation email a few days before our trip reminding me of my reservation (like I needed a reminder? Thanks anyway!), there was a note at the bottom notifying me of a $20 suite upgrade if I brought in the printout. So I did. I presented it during check in, fully ready to pay the 20 bucks to upgrade for a suite. If I'm staying in Chicago for four days, might as well stay in style, right? Well...I didn't need to present the confirmation form OR pay the 20 dollars -- they upgraded me for free. Wow. The room was amazing. There was plenty of room, and free wireless internet is always a plus. And our view of the city was FANTASTIC. Wow. I couldn't stop taking pictures. We had a few things that we needed to refrigerate, and I noticed in the guest book that they rented out small fridges for $25 a night, so I called housekeeping to get one. I wasn't excited about paying $100 for a fridge, but I needed it. Well, a few minutes later, the front desk attendant called and told me that the fridge was on it's way up to our room, and it would only be a $20 dollar charge for our entire stay. SWEET! I loved the location of the hotel. It was steps away from Michigan avenue, and there were plenty of bus stops around to take us anywhere else we needed to go.  It was 2 blocks from Giordano's! Can't beat that at all! Elephant & Castle is a cool pub connected to the hotel. The service can be slow at times, but the food is terrific. Don't skip out on that. The 40th floor lounge left a lot to be desired. You can get better drinks and atmosphere elsewhere. When I come back to Chicago, there's no doubt in my mind that I will stay at the Avenue again. It was amazing. I miss that place already. Oh, and they never did charge me for the fridge. Awesome! :)";5;1;1;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

We had a suite and were not aware of it because the room was cheap. We booked the room a week in advance on Expedia. We had a sitting area with a TV, a full bathroom, and a separate bedroom. There were two TV's,and an i-pod home (LOVE THAT). They will charge you, however, if you use the refrigerator. Stupid Chicago rule... Anywho, we also had drinks in the pub downstairs and I believe I had the best martini in my life. It is called a Castle Wrecker and you must try it--hints of raspberry, peach, and lime :) What I really liked about this place is that we are very young looking for our age and we were never discriminated for that. I have been to places where I have been looked at oddly because I look young, but I am in my mid-twenties and I can easily afford nice things. This place treated us with respect and I highly appreciate that.";5;1;0;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
8/10/2010;FLd4tNGgyDfF8hUvOrtthA;WgaycWkFXshvGtct42d_-w;"I recently stayed at the Avenue for 4 nights and I really enjoyed my stay. When I first got there I was upgraded to a suite from my regular room because my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. We had a great room 2615 which had a great view of the Chicago Skyline which I would look at as I fell asleep in our giant king size bed. The room was also on a corner so our bedroom was very bright when we had the curtains open. The room also had a lot of closet space, one in the livingroom and a walk in closet in the bedroom. I dont know what people are saying about the TV channels.... there were plenty... 50+ so either they upgraded their cable or I think 50+ channels is enough in a hotel... since you're not there to watch tv on vacation right? The only thing that might annoy people is that Northwestern University Hospital is across the street so ambulances come and go all the time with sirens on. It didnt bother me at all but I am a sound sleeper. But I also live i a big city and am use to sirens all the time. The rooftop pool was awesome. I went everyday and it was really warm... 70F or 20C. Great view from up there too. The only real issue I had was with room service. I ordered a french onion soup which was delicious and a garden salad which in the room service menu said it was with mesculn greens, tomato, cucumber and croutons. When it arrived to my dismay it was the non nutritional heart of romaine lettuce and most of the pieces were white and it did not have croutons. When I told the front desk they looked into it which I was happy about. Later she told me that room service said I got what I had asked for which I certainly did not... I know what the menu said and it did not match what arrived at my room. I was happy that the concierge took it off my bill but they did not include the 20% charge that goes on the $5.50 they took off my bill. I was not wanting to overcomplain so I am yelping you to advise you not to order the garden salad from room service. Special shout out to our housekeeper Elizabetha. She was amazing friendly and engaging. I love her, shes really doing a great job. I would stay here again for sure.";4;1;1;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

From the moment you walk in the lobby door you are surrounded by modern touches and a friendly staff to boot. The rooms are relatively spacious for a downtown hotel, and the furnishings are very luxurious. After I stepped foot in the room, I never wanted to leave again. Plush zebra print chairs, a beautifully designed bathroom with a huge sparkling clean bath, and the best part of the room, the plush bed that I had to drag myself out of the next morning. I've never ordered room service before but I almost did just so I could stay in bed longer.

Our check-in process also took a little longer than it should have. However that's where the negativity ends. The lady at the check-in counter was pleasant and gave us a corner one bedroom suite on the 27th floor (which I'm pretty sure wasn't what we had reserved for just $95). The room was great. Leather couch, flat screen TV, i-home and a comfy 'zebra' chair - and that's just the living room area. The bedroom was like any other hotel room except with better decor, a nice view of Michigan ave and the best bed ever. The goose down pillows were heavenly and I think we had the best sleep in years on that bed. It was insanely comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was small but efficient with a nice wide shower head and soft towels. We did not have to call or request anything. Everything was provided. We did not try the sky lounge or their room service so can't comment on that. (I am not one to pay $15 + tax + $3 room service charge + 18% gratuity just so I can eat 2 eggs and toast!) The check out was fast and easy and the concierge kept our bags after we checked out so we could roam the city without dragging a suitcase. A great hotel stay for a great price!

This is mid-market for downtown Chicago but the hotel is in a terrific location on the Magnificent Mile within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and Navy Pier. A 24 hour Walgreens is two blocks away. Overall we were very happy with the experience. Service - just outstanding. Everyone was exceedingly helpful and we were immediately upgraded to a suite since my wife and I were traveling with two children. Questions were easily answered and any minor problems were quickly addressed. Staff tried very hard to accommodate all our requests. See below. Room Quality - solid if not spectacular. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of room. Bathrooms were clean. Refrigerator is a full mini-bar with no room for anything else. We took things out to put our own drinks in. Initially we were billed for the things we took out because, evidently, if you move items it activates a sensor. The staff was very nice about it and took the charges off the bill. They even comped us the 2-3 snacks my kids ate. Hard to complain about that. TV was a little small but who, eh, really cares. Go do stuff. Amenities - my kids loved the rooftop pool and went up there almost every day. I never made it but the kids said it was great. Free WiFi! - you can't take this for granted any more. Very easy to use. Slower than optimum but not unduly so. This was a factor in choosing the hotel, if you can believe that. Business Center - Lower marks for the business center. Internet was unbelievably slow and problems were encountered because of the odd customized browser installed which led to unnecessary complications with printing and disabling pop-up blockers. Not to pick on the Crowne, since this is an endemic irritation with most hotel business centers. Make sure you aren't in a hurry (e.g. rushing to buy and print event tickets) if you use this. The printer looked brand new though! Pricing was highly competitive given the location. We booked through a Travelocity deal. We would absolutely stay here again.";4;0;0;0;N;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

The bathroom has decent shampoo/conditioner/lotions and a nice shower head, but the best part was the actual full-sized blow dryer (none of these travel-sized junkers).  The hotel bar had an interesting array of tap beers.

Some things that did not endear the Drake to me: 1) No free wifi in the rooms for the regular Joes of the world. You have to be a Hilton Honors Gold or Platinum member to get free wifi in the room. Otherwise you will incur a cost of $12.95 per day or $7.50 for 1 hr to access their wifi. 2) Valet parking was an astounding $55 for overnight parking! 3) It cost me $249/ngt for a standard King room during a slow time of the month. 4) I thought the lobby was not all that others claim it to be. It was nothing spectacular. Many other hotels have a more appealing lobby. The staff are very eager to please and are all friendly and hospitable. Also, I did enjoy the gym.

We made our reservation through the hotel's website for a regular King bed room and they upgraded us to a junior king suite when we checked in. The room was on the 7th floor and we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. The hotel itself is historical and it has retained its charm through the decor and rustic style furniture. At the same time, the bed, linen, bathroom feels clean and does not look dingy or old. The suite was huge. There is an entryway when you first come in which opens up into a sitting room with a couch (which I believe could be made into a queen bed), two arm chairs, desk, TV, and closet. This is connected to the bedroom with a King bed, another closet, and another TV! My only complaint was that the tub drained a bit slowly and they were not really able to resolve the issue even after I had asked them to clear it. We were celebrating a special occasion and the girl at the front desk was very nice to acknowledge this when we were checking in. The general manager also sent us a cake and a bottle of champagne the first night to help us celebrate! The hotel is located towards the end of Michigan Ave so it is a bit further from the Loop and restaurants but there are plenty of buses that stop just a block away from the hotel. The closest Metro is the Chicago Red Line which is about 4 blocks or a 10 minute walk away.

1/30/2011;2rsz;m5YKsIS6JUKQ0BfQBWvpoQ;"Where is the ability to post a photo for a review on here?  I can't find it, because I took a shot of the cheese platter that my partner and I shared at the Palm Court during our stay there this weekend. And that is where our story begins, my dear readers.  A cheese platter with Town House crackers on one side, and Clubhouse on the other?  Yep, you read that right.  Oh, how the Drake has fallen on hard times, I thought, especially when I heard that they just did a Groupon for High Tea there.  Has it come to that?  Before they do a deal with Groupon, Sun-Times' new WantsaDeal, or any other--- I would suggest they get their house in order. Now, since I stayed there the whole weekend, I feel a bit entitled to comment across the board on the Drake.  I've lived in Chicago for 17+ years (most of my adult life), so I never stay at a hotel in town, but it felt like a luxury to treat my partner to his birthday weekend at a hotel that, for me, conjured images of Mad Men, high style, and impeccable service. I won't go into the coordination ""challenges"" with organizing a group of 30 friends for late night dessert and drinks, but I will say that when the evening was complete and I was ready for bed, I found out we were ""conveniently"" placed next to a bridal party, who sounded as though they were in our room.  In fact, at 7 the next morning, these people hosted guests (more like the entire party.. people were literally in the hallway!!) in their room (which was not a suite). Really? The hotel allows that, when there's nothing but a hollow door that separates rooms?  As my partner said, he's never been in a hotel of the Drake's status in which you could literally hear the people right next to you. We capped off our stay with an $80 breakfast for 2 at Drake Bros that consisted of: a waiter who tried to push the buffet on us (lazy), 1 order of cold brioche french toast (3 small slices), 2 Drake Breakfasts (my ""aged pork loin"" was a shriveled up small slice of cold, bland ham), and water.  Ouch to lack of value. The Drake could be so much more than what's it's become-- a tourist destination for bridal parties, or girls, their Mother's, and their American dolls.  In fact, if they took a page from some great hotels in New York (e.g., Gramercy Park Hotel) that have emerged as hip, local destinations that still appeal to travelers-- with cool furnishings, but with nods to the past, it could be so much more successful.  Instead of cheese trays with Keebler Crackers, and restaurants with names like ""Cape Cod Room"" written in rope and ""Lobster Thermador"" on the menu (OML, Gordon Ramsey would have a field day here), it really needs to be brought into the 21st Century.  A nod to Mad Men, but contemporized.   But, please, start with eliminating the ""cheesy"" crackers and soundproofing the rooms. As a post script to this review, the Drake graciously accepted our feedback, apologized, and ""made it right by us"".  That's a classy start and I respect them and would give them another chance.";2;4;3;6;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

The meal is completed with beautiful offerings from the pastry chef.  You can also get champagne to compliment your meal and complete your outing. I love how accommodating and consistent the service is. Our pots were toped off with hot water frequently, the snacks were brought out almost immediately and the server was always around to answer questions and grab us anything we needed (and to take a picture of the mother daughter outing).  I do want to mention that each time I am here I see men enjoying tea as well and I like that.  It is not just a mother's day activity- it's for anyone who wants to indulge in a delectable nibbles, tasty beverages and beautiful atmosphere in the middle of the afternoon!";5;10;7;4;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
11/29/2009;F5lshVGcdxUPANTTA1vPLQ;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;"As a fan of anything with historic significance- my recent stay at the Drake made me imagine I was back in the 1920's living the life of the upper class who have stayed there over the years. Now granted- as with any historic building- your room is kind of the ""luck of the draw"". Over the years rooms have been combined, cut in half, etc to maximize the space but that is just one of the quirks of old hotels. The Drake has recently also undergone a remodel so all the spaces are new, clean and up to date. My room, on this stay, was fabulous. It was huge- easily accommodating a king sized bed, desk chair and ottoman, dresser, bar and overlooked Lake Michigan. The marbled bath was also huge- in fact- you could have put additional furniture into it. The ceilings were at least 15 feet tall and bordered in crown molding. The hallway was wide and regal. But I also know from previous stays, that some rooms are smaller, have no view, and some have 2 bathrooms and a small bedroom- and some are suites. If when you push open your door and are dissatisfied- you owe it to yourself to call the desk to see if there is anything else available. Hilton Hotels now owns the Drake so all the expected amenities are there- the comfy soft beds and linens, the Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, the well stocked mini bar and good service (although I am a frequent traveler at Hilton hotels so that may have helped out in the service area) My room rate was only $139 per night (plus an additional $49 per night for valet parking- next time I'm leaving the car at home!) One of my favorite parts of the stay was a book that was in the room chronicling the history of the Drake hotel through letters and pictures of all the famous people who had gone through it's doors. And oh if those doors could speak. Queens, Kings, celebrities have all stayed at the Drake. Also interesting were the pictures of the old ads that billed the Drake as the place to get ""Lake Michigan air"" for only $5 per night (1920) I may not be a Queen, a King or any kind of a celebrity. But for the weekend I spent at the Drake, I certainly felt like one.";5;10;7;3;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

I've been to a few teas and brunches.  Tea is nothing special - I can do pumpernickel bread with egg salad and sliced, cascaded strawberrys in my own house, and I am no Martha Stewart.  Brunch is pretty grand though - waaay better than the Drake in Oak Brook.  I've visited friends' rooms, nothing extraordinary - I prefer the Allegro or Monaco.

6/30/2008;MnwSs6JOUJFCK-RfWKdCRw;DiFrVAA1p5UVu7rjPzrZxg;"I really struggled between rating The Drake with 3 or 4 stars. Having grown up in the surrounding suburbs, I have been made well aware of the prestige and history behind The Drake. When my then boyfriend and I planned our 1 year anniversary, we decided to each plan surprises for one another involving things we saw on our first date - a freezing cold 8 hour day spent exploring different parts the city. When walking by The Drake, I'd told him that it was the finest of the finest (he was from Kentucky and therefore unfamiliar) so for my anniversary I was surprised with a two night stay at this luxurious hotel. Words cannot properly describe the warmth of this debonair lobby with its beautiful rich mahogany toned colors, fine crystal chandeliers, and overwhelming aura of class. While well kept, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the decor was as old as the hotel itself. If not, I tip my hat to the person that recreated the sheer elegance of the 1920's. When I'm not writing about bars or drinking, I can be somewhat of a history nerd, and as dorky as it may sound, I enjoyed feeling like I had stepped in the past. Then I arrived on my floor. Holy Shit when did this become The Overlook Hotel? The second  I walked off the elevator, I became immediately aware that I was in a 90 year old building. The colors were cold and in complete contrast to what I expected from the lobby. It was almost a little creepy. When we arrived in our room, I found it very odly arranged. This may be a little hard to follow, so bear with me. Picture a rectangular room. The bed is against the a long side and faces the other long side with a night stand and desk on either side. The television (if laying in bed) was in the upper right corner of the room. Basically, the television wasn't straight on to the bed and the other long wall that was opposite to the bed was completely bare. The room just seemed very oddly arranged and unfinished. Much like the hallways, it lacked any color and had a slightly spooky vibe. While we were there, the concierge was nice enough to take us on a tour of the Presidential Suite where Princess Diana famously stayed in the early 90's. Once again I was blown away by the elegance of the 1920's being beautifully captured. It was surprisingly stunning to see such luxury up close. Even though our room slightly creeped me out, I still love The Drake Hotel for all that it embodies. Despite being $400 a night, I'm pretty sure our room was the equivalent of second class on the Titanic. I'm not sure we got our money's worth room wise, and if I ever return (I say ever because I have since moved to the city) I would definitely upgrade my room for the full experience. I do however think that every Chicagoian should tour the Presidential Suite. It is BREATH TAKING!";4;4;3;4;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

I have personally stayed at the Drake, which I booked for a friend's birthday a couple of years back during Christmas time.  And because of the season, I was very impressed with the decorations throughout. Unfortunately, my last experience with the Drake was definitely sub par. Back in June, I booked a room at the Drake with my points for a real great friend of mine and her husband to celebrate her birthday.  Because it was her birthday, I ordered a platter of cold cuts and meats along with a birthday cake, and even called the hotel and spoke to the catering manager to ensure that the catering department charged MY credit card for these items. When my friends checked in, they were very satisfied with the room, which was great.  However, when they checked out, they charged THEIR credit card for the items I ordered for her birthday.  I did not find this out until I spoke with my friends, and they told me about the incident to ensure we were not double charged for the items. When I inquired with my credit card company, they did not charge me.  What irritated me about this incident is the fact that I had to call the hotel from Florida (I was there for business) to get this entire thing straightened out AFTER I gave them specific instructions on who to charge.  What was even worse is the fact that this is very embarrassing to me in front of my friends. Now, I did contact the Hilton Diamond Desk and let them know about the incident and they conducted an investigation on this, but there were also some serious communication issues within themselves as the hotel told the Diamond Desk they contacted me, when in fact they did not.  I also called the hotel manager regarding this, and it took them 3 days to get back with me.

Quite large with a huge desk, massive king sized bed, free internet, large closets, comfortable desk chair, couch, beautiful paintings on the wall, well stocked mini bar and all of the appointments you'd expect in a top hotel.

I went with a group of 12 ladies to the Palm Court over the weekend and found it to be a wonderful experience.  The sandwiches were lovely, as were the scones and pastries.  I was disappointed however that they used whipped cream instead of traditional English-style clotted cream.  I would love to have their recipe for the egg salad sandwich.  The tea I chose off of their menu of about 15-20 teas was gorgeous, with just the right amount of cream and one lump!  What a treat.  Sitting there in their comfy chairs, with the harp music and the beautiful surroundings, sipping tea, eating a delicate sandwich made me wish I'd been born in another time and place and class... LOL.   I've not tried afternoon tea at other places in the city so I've nothing ot compare them too (The Four Seasons or Peninsula being also at the top of the list supposedly), so if this is as good as it gets, that's great.  And if the Drake's Tea isn't the best in the city, I can't wait to find the best!!";5;1;1;1;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

For example, there is a ladies' ""powder room.""  Each lady has her own vanity in a little private bathroom.  But the faucet leaks.  The chair upholstery is worn.  The toilet paper roll fell off the wall. Also, the tea for this place is outrageous.  $30 for tiny white bread egg salad sandwiches.  I get it, I've been to a high tea before, but this is not worth it.

I struggled between a 3 & 4 star because I expected more since it was ""The Drake"" but overall my stay was fine. Although it does have the historic charm, the location is great and the service was ok overall, there were little things that I didn't particularly care for which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.  If I could, I would of given it a 3.5 star rating. 1. When we first checked in, they gave us a room that was not made.  The bed looked like someone had laid on top of it, there was garbage in the trash can etc.  I went downstairs and they changed my room but I didn't like that the person from the front desk went to the back office to check to make sure that the room really wasn't made. 2. I assume the elevators are still from the 1920's because they move incredibly slow.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but when you have to wait several elevators (they are full from so many people waiting) in order to finally get in one during peak times (ie. check out time etc.) it's a little annoying.   3. It was pretty warm when we were there and we wanted to get ice. Well the ice machine on our floor was broken.  When I flagged down someone that worked there to tell him, he said that I'd have to go to a different floor and try the machines there.  I would think being a high end hotel, I expected him to have offered to get some for us but I guess I was expecting too much. 4. The room itself was ok although I thought the carpet needed to be changed.  It looked really used and worn in and definitely needs to be updated.  The bed was comfortable though which is a big plus in my book. One of the good things about the hotel was the gym.  The gym had just been remodeled and it's very nice.  There are some cardio and weight machines.  There is also a section that had free weights too and there are flat screen tv's there too.

I also love knowing that Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth and so many other cool people have stayed here. Love the history! There was a book in our room detailing the history of the hotel. Very interesting. I would recommend this hotel to anyone - great atmosphere, clean, beautiful, historic and perfect location to Michigan Ave and all of downtown Chicago.";5;0;0;0;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

12/18/2009;sBGJgGhaajicaJy8uYxVLw;HFj6tAGbKUtfnBVt9GFXoQ;"I went this past week for a holiday tea--total let down. The atmosphere is nice and it's decorated beautifully for the holidays. I enjoyed the harpist, but found the roving carolers slightly annoying. They were good, but I would have appreciated them more if they didn't sing over my table every 15 minutes. The tea selection was nice and the service was very good, but the food. Total waste of money. Probably one of the worst teas imaginable. The scones were ROCK hard, totally inedible. I had a similar one on United Airlines recently. The sandwiches were ok, but nothing to save the overall selection. I only tried the strawberry tart among the deserts. I LOVE strawberry tarts, so I was totally disappointed when they managed to mess this one up as well. The strawberries were good but the crust was hard and stale tasting. Also, the champagne they advertise is $30 a glass. They also have one for $11, but they promote the $30 glass--I'm sorry but that's ridiculous. We asked for the wine list and had a glass of wine instead. If you're not picky about food or have not been to a proper tea before, it's a nice experience but for such a first rate hotel I expected more.";2;0;0;0;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

I was so incredibly impressed by the staff's professionalism and staff, but even more impressed by the general manager himself. One of his quotes basically said that he's not only in the business of retaining the old memories, but also continuing to make memories (the actual quote is much better stated, but I don't have it on me at the moment). His view of cutting-edge technology (he's in favor of it) was surprising to me. But his friendliness and willingness to give me his time was even more impressive. The hotel definitely has a historic, English grandmother's-attic aesthetic.

1/5/2009;mN-;ZKHpDDP3KJf-2WVzsyGyUg;"This review is on their New Years Eve party, put on by Scene Chicago. Had a great time with the group we went with. Plenty of food at the buffet tables, along with people coming around with trays. The drinks were excellent and strong, with not so bad lines. Maybe about a 5 min wait. Tops. They had 4 rooms with a range of music from hip hop to 80s. 2 of the rooms being large, 2 being not much more than a lounge type of area. My biggest complaint was the bathrooms. The lines were horrendous! About 20-25 min wait, only to find out there was no toilet paper. Really? I send almost two hundred a ticket (not including the dinner) and you can't supply me with some soft TP for my bum? What made me mad, was that I was standing in line from 1230am to 1255am and when I went up to the bar, they had already stopped serving booze. (Even though it was supposed to go until 1am). The crowd was a twenty something and was a great time. Until around 1am. Two girls puking in the bathroom (hold your liquor ladies!) and one guy laying on the floor with a black eye (as the cops were trying to pull him up and take him out). Oh! And they also came around about 1145pm with TONS of NYE flair. Hats, noise makers, streamers, etc. Even though people were going nuts with it all, there was plenty to go around. I must say that they have great staff there. All in all: Fun, but not worth the $$.";3;2;1;1;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

10/23/2009;lnKows4y8KPzilJ2kGTc;9jBxy-r-9BDdQ-k6eP66YA;"Wow. This place just oozes elegance. I've heard of the Drake in movies, and have known some people that have stayed here, but I've never been here myself. And now that I have, anytime I'm invited I will be sure to show up. For a couple reasons. 1) Because you know that the food is going to be good. 2) Anytime you come here especially with a date or on a date I'm pretty sure you're gonna get some just based on general principal. 3) It actually feels good to go somewhere that you pass by so often on LSD, and that has so much historical significance. The restaurant inside is the famous Coq D'or. This is where Joe DiMaggio and Marylin Monroe carved their names into one of the booths. I came here for a little private wedding reception in room 550 which is the Princess Diana suite. And yes it does look fit for a princess. The view is out to lsd and the beach, and the bedroom is just about the same square footage as my last apartment. But when I think about if I would stay here... probably not. It's in an area where gucci and louis vitton are right across the street. So not only will it be a pretty penny, but it will also piss you off when you walk out the door and see an old couple expect you to wait in line behind them just because they have old money. So for the same price you will get a larger room at let's say the wit or the sofitel. But if you're in the area walk into the lobby and go back to the 50's and 60's. You almost feel like an expectation to see Kathleen Turner and Dustin Hoffman to walk through the lobby from the graduate.";4;1;1;0;N;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

It was the most comfortable bed my bf said he slept on, and he plans to get the same mattress for his home. It is an experience to spend nights in a historic place, where Princess Diana, Queen of England, and other Heads of State also stayed. We spent a wonderful Christmas having a 5-course meal that was $100 per person. It seems extravagant, but it was well worth it. It started with a never-ending bread bowl, champagne, fruit, pumpkin bisque, turkey with cranberries and mashed potatoes, multiple servings of all dessert (creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries, shortbread cookies). Santa Claus even came by to personally wish each person Happy  Holidays. It was a perfect memory. The gym is also free to use during your stay.

After reading some reviews we actually wanted to stay on the highest floor (under the club) so that we can be loud or at least listen to some music on the ipod dock the hotel PROVIDES. So one minute into a song we get a knock on the door about it being loud. It was 9pm. So we decide to go party upstairs and realized we have to go down to the lobby to take a separate elevator to go to the club. Thats fine but at least tell us instead of us trying to figure out if the elevator is broken or instead of trying the stairs etc it was so stupid for a while. Club was very cool though and staff excellent. We tried the tequila from Entourage. Not my fave but shots were free. Also we went to the restaurant Argent and had an awesome chat with the waitress who gave us great tourist advice. They took the term cake in crab cake a little too literally, I felt I was eating a birthday cake. The sushi was very good. We were happy the hotel/resto/club carry sugar free redbull and they even have discrete redbull art written on the elevator doors. The room was very nice. Sadly we didnt get any of the two upgrades we had requested a month earlier but the room was ok. The rainfall shower is AMAZING. Probably my fave part. Keep in mind the only ice machine is on the 5th floor. A maid told us they have free ice delivery but to request it in the morning. We didnt know this until check out. What a downer. All in all, staff were great, valet guys are awesome and helpful. The rest is nowhere near deserving any luxurious term.

We are locals who venture downtown once or twice a year to play tourist.  We have frequently chosen The Dana Hotel for these staycations.  Our first visit a few years ago was awesome.  We were in love with its simplistic design and the great views from the corner rooms.  Last year, we noticed the upkeep had started to slip a bit, but figured the hotel would quickly address them.  Our visit this past weekend was just sad.   Not only is the hotel due for a renovation of sorts, but it is in need of some mega upkeep.  The bedroom furniture is all banged up and scratched.  The hallway carpeting on our floor was peeling back right in front of the elevator bank.  We noticed this when we checked in and it was not addressed the entire weekend.  This is ugly to begin with, but a huge trip hazzard to boot!!!  We began inspecting the entire hallway carpet one morning while waiting for the elevator (more on that to come) and noticed none of the lines in the carpet were lined up and there was a ripple effect all down the hallway.  The carpeting needs to be replaced...plain and simple. One thing I have always hated about the rooms is the bathroom.  It has an open shower which means that you can see the other person showering.  Fine...whatever.  This also means that you can see clearly the other person using the toilet.  Come on.  Absolutely nothing sexy about that.  The flimsy ""shower curtain"" which is located on the bedroom side outside of the shower is just ridiculous and doesn't fully cover the glass. The elevators blow!!!  I wish it was as simple as blaming the party goers to Vertigo Sky on the top floor, but the elevators are an issue when Vertigo is not opened.  You wait FOREVER for an elevator and when it arrives it is jammed pack full of people.  We got so fed up that we would just take the stairs down.  We were on a floor in the 20's and though we only took the stairs down I can barely walk today due to my calves hurting so freaking bad from the many ventures down the stairs!!! The majority of the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The only real odd encounter was one of the times we actually got an elevator ride.  The elevator stopped on a floor and an employee got half way in the elevator and decided to talk on the walky talky while the elevator doors kept trying to close.  We were all just staring at him.  Not once did he apologize or say excuse me or whatever...nothing.  Just held us all up and then eventually got in and rode up with us. One of the positives about this hotel is that the mini bar/fridge items are fairly decently priced.  A big plus if you want a quick beer, bottle of wine, or quick snack.  Another plus is its lcoation...you can walk to tons of restaurants/bars, etc. Doubtful that we will return to the Dana unless we hear that they have done some sort of overhaul.";2;2;1;2;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

I know previous yelpers quibbled about having to take an elevator to get to the lobby, but this is not atypical in city hotels.  Besides, it adds another level of security, when it prevents any Tom, Dick or Mary from the street from gaining access. The lobby was small but well appointed.  Typical of a ""boutique"" style property. I was a bit nervous that at 9:30 a.m. I was going to get the ""That's a bit early to check in Ms. *****, and we have no rooms available.""  But alas my fears did not materialize and I was on my way, key in hand,  to my 14th floor room.   The double double was super clean, cozy, and had floor to ceiling windows.  It had a good feel, and I was happy with the room and the little extras like the Keurig coffee machine, robes, slippers, and trendy toiletries.  The rain shower was also kind of cool as it had a large panel of glass as its wall so you could shower with not only views of the room but the outside as well.  Perfect for exhibitionists or voyeurs.  If you happen to be a bit prudish, of course, there was a drape that would give you the privacy you needed. The service here was top notch.  I had some special requests that were carried out immediately and with great care and concern.  The location was perfect in many ways.  It was close to great restaurants, sightseeing, shopping, etc, and it also had convenient places nearby like Starbucks, CVS and WholeFoods. Folks interested in this property should note it is not categorized as a 5 star property in hotel terms, but the experience you have here could certainly be rated that high.";4;2;0;1;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

I wish I'd just stuck with the massage. I typically stick to affordable (less than $50) nail salons.  I've never had a spa mani/pedi before, but I had one done at a salon before (Anna George) and loved it, so I figured the treatment would be similar. It was pretty much the same service I've received at my cheap salons.  My technician was friendly and the equipment was clean, but I wasn't blown away by anything.  I was getting a spa service, but I wasn't shown into the relaxation room or given a bathrobe and slippers, like other customers.  There's no drying station, so I sat in the reception area for about 15 minutes while my nails dried. I don't think I would come back for another mani/pedi.  I paid $80 (plus tip) and my manicure chipped within a day.  My pedicure chipped within a week - and my pedicures usually last 2-3 weeks.  I've had the same type of service at my cheap places, so I think I will stick to those spots.";3;1;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

As we pulled up out front the bellhop boys eagerly greeted us and took our luggage into the hotel. We arrived around 10:00am because of our early flight so the bellhop said he would tag our suitcases and when our room was ready he would have them delivered. Check in is actually one level up, you can either take the cool glass elevator directly there or walk up the short window encased beautiful stairwell up. The concierge pleasantly greeted us and advised our rooms were not ready and told us she'd alert us as soon they were. We inquired about upgrading our room and she graciously offered us a room on the quieter side of the building at a discounted rate. Room 2114 - Serene King The room is gorgeous, long & spacious with dark wood floors and a magnificent floor to ceiling window with views on the city and street below. The bed was very plush and comfy and the bathroom included a rainfall shower head and bowl sink. FYI the shower's back wall is glass and is exposed to the bedroom but covered by a curtain. So if your in the shower, someone in the bedroom could pull the curtain aside and take a peep at you. It's not an issue if your a couple but if you have privacy issues you want to keep this in mind. You also get free wifi in the hotel and complimentary use the in room keurig coffee machine. The mini bar is well stocked with affordable items. Our room was cleaned everyday and kept spotless with fresh towels replaced everyday and we had no issue with noise level at night. Dining Room service is sooo fast! Our meal came up in about 15 minutes hot and fresh! We had breakfast and dinner at Aja (on site restaurant) and both meals were exquisite! Vertigo (on site club) was amazing! They have a heated patio with fire pit and great drinks! Service Everyone from the doorman, to concierge, housekeepers, waiters, and managers were sooo kind and helpful! The concierge manager helped my fiancee arrange for flowers to be delivered to my room on my birthday, the concierge told us to have a free bottle of wine from the mini bar on the house to celebrate our birthday, the doormen were great on giving us tips on how to navigate the city and where are good places to check out. Everyone we encountered greeted us with smiles and graciousness. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to others! The Dana made our Birthdays very memorable and enjoyable! This hotel is in the perfect location walking distance to many great restaurants and even the Magnificent Mile!

4/2/2012;N4j7iOr6memcsF3ZhhAxXg;2vJ2e51kdbdAmAo_HTr4KQ;"Introduction Lobby/Check In: As per other reviews, check in is a bit different in this hotel. My bf and I were greeted by a GREAT and NICE doorman. He explained to us that check in was upstairs, got the elevator for us and explained briefly that there was a main restaurant and lounge should we want to have a drink and a bite. Check in is a floor up and when we got of the elevator, that's when the impression of the hotel dwindled a bit. The guy, slouched in his seat, looked like he just wanted to go home. He asked for credit card and passport, then spewed of gym this, lounge this, bar that and pointed to the elevator. Excellent doorman ruined by the mediocre check-in guy. Room Number 1215: Awesome room! It's modern with hard wood floor (or look alike). The room is small, but I have to give credit to the design team that efficiently uses the space. It's a very intimate room so definitely go with someone you are comfortable sharing space with. The bathroom is spaced in such a way that the shower overlooks the room and is covered with a curtain on the outside. Such that, if you are taking a shower, someone could just pull the curtain aside and ... By the way, I loved the rainfall shower head which I have always wanted in my bathroom. There is a balcony, but the room we got, it was very small and slanted. So don't expect to be sitting and lying down outside. Besides, buildings everywhere, so not the best atmosphere to be sunbathing. Noise-Level: NOISY! This hotel is in the heart of downtown Chicago, and because there are glass windows (top to bottom), you can hear the sirens, construction, honking, etc... Light sleepers beware. Extras: Concierge. There is one man who sits at a table across from the check-in desk and he is okay. We asked him many times to recommend restaurants of various cuisines which is fine, but never offered to make reservations, or provide alternate restaurants to the ones he selected should they be busy. The concierge I envision makes reservations, provide alternatives, and seems to go to the ends of the earth to make things happen. Just me I guess. FYI. We asked the concierge for late checkout and we were told that you can only request that the morning that you are leaving...""May the odds be forever in your favour"" (YEAH HUNGER GAMES!) Vertigo Sky Rooftop Lounge. This hotel turns into a club on the weekends which makes the hotel turn into chaos. My bf and I returned from a late night movie and by 12:30AM, we could see the line of people trying to get into the hotel. The club (penthouse floor) is accessed by a card key which one man has (the bouncer I presume) which is hard for guests who just want to get up to the room because you have to wait in line too. What should have happened was to dedicate one elevator for people who wanted to go to the lounge, and the rest for guests. My bf and I were checked for ID's and were told to get to the back of the line, and we retorted that we actually were hotel guests and had to show our card key. It really is a hassle, and because of this experience, my star rating dropped. Doormen. These people are really great. The first one we encountered was excellent, and the last one on our check-out day was fabulous too (apparently, he won the best doorman award...) He stated he would get us a taxi to Mid-way airport for a flat fee of $35 because it could be more expensive with traffic, etc... He hunted down 3 taxis to get us the assured rate which we appreciated. By the way, as of today, flat rate from downtown to Midway is $35 USD. Conclusion. I'm glad we stayed at this hotel, but I don't think we will be coming back here again. I want to try other hotels in Chicago and my experience here was just A-OK. However, I can't fault the location as it is walking distance from the CTC, Magnificent Mile, and Millennium Park. 3 night stay, starting Thursday, was $640 and change including all hotel taxes and fees.";3;3;2;2;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

12/19/2011;f9l6OBAFakc7BaxMlNZxIw;5MCBLBxr10NLUKZ4AboAMg;"Shaky, shaky. First of all, here's a staff breakdown: (my major complaint at the Dana) Door guys: All great. Friendly. Held doors. Fetched elevators. Helped with bags. Front desk/reception: Rude, short, annoyed, unhelpful. Reservations: unprofessional and mostly unhelpful. Housekeeping: Mostly ok, save one day they forgot to clean and leaving a room service tray outside of our room for 24 hours. Spa: Great. My major issues were both with Reservations and the Front Desk. Everyone seems unhappy. IT shows through, I just kept thinking ""you guys should NOT be in hospitality."" Yes, I booked rooms through Expedia. No, that does NOT mean that you should treat me as less of a guest. Last time I checked booking $1500 worth of rooms at a hotel should warrant at the very LEAST adequate service. After many blunders and trials, finally our rooms were all situated. Not without much headache. I wasn't so much unimpressed with the fact that there was an error, but I was displeased with the way in which it was handled. ""Jason"" was not only exasperated, but also pretty lame. At 8am if I have to hear ""Well guess what? You've got a problem now!"" in a really high pitched, mocking tone...I'm going to be annoyed. Figure out the problems. That's your job. That's really your only job, actually. The rooms are nice, the floor to ceiling windows in the corner rooms are pretty radical. The views are nice. If you are booking here, def get a corner as the other ones have very little light (my coworker had one). The rooms aren't huge, but they are well appointed for the most part. The bathroom was awkward, sliding door that never stayed shut, could not lock, and a curtain over the shower? Weird. IT was clean and pretty stylish though, and not a bad spot to hang for 4 days. Room service was great (from Aja downstairs). Quickly arrived and food was really good. The tray sat outside for a day though, which is actually pretty gross. Overall, I won't stay again. With so many good options in Chicago, the Dana fell short. I got a great rate on Expedia, but if you book through an engine it seems you get subpar service and a crummy attitude. No thanks. Guests are guests and I can take my business elsewhere. *Spa was great. Separate review. *Valet $38";2;12;4;8;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

The most annoying thing about the hotel is the elevators. We stayed with a baby and were using a stroller and you must take an elevator up 1 floor to get on another elevator to get to your room. There are 2 or 3 other elevators that go from street level throughout the hotel that are empty, that they reserve from the rooftop bar only and staff only. These elevators remain empty, while the others are overcrowded and make many stops. Once on that elevator you must insert your card into the slot to press your button and hope the elevator has not already started moving. Most other people in the elevators were confused and annoyed by this. In addition they put us in a room next to the elevator that was noisy and you could hear the club music coming up from in from inside the room. In addition one night there were (what sounded like 20) drunk people hanging out in our hallway, talking really loud for at least a half an hour, which isn't really the hotels fault, except the rooms were not sound proofed. Whoever designed this hotel is an idiot. ALL of the design elements are completely disjointed, and do not go together. The style over thought, all over the place and is in poor taste. These is nothing inspiring or calming about it. Less is more people!";2;0;0;1;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

The BEST part is the breathtaking views from the balcony.  Request a room with a balcony!  As many times as I've been to Chicago, I still paused just getting out of the elevator and admired the views.  It reminded me of the Signature Room on the 95th floor.  Besides the floor to ceiling windows, the room includes free wi-fi, a 24 hour fitness center with a cool TRX-ish weight pulley system, ipod dock with good speakers, and Keurig machine.   If they could do something about the noise level, it would be 5 stars.  Yes, the hotel is in the city so you expect to hear trains, sirens, etc., but the noise I heard was the ice machine and people walking in the hallway.  It was loud enough to wake you up at night but not constant enough to keep you up.  I met my co-worker for breakfast (their 3 ingredient omelet and potatoes are very tasty) and he mentioned how loud the hotel was too.  It's still an awesome hotel.  I usually stay at the Public hotel and will pick Dana hotel next time.";4;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Another reason i deducted a star is because i was given a handicapped room so we didn't get the cool peek-a-boo shower and i was really actually looking forward to that by the time i got to my room and unloaded my stuff i realized it and was not going to change the room.  Also, it is complete chaos on a Saturday night in their lobby and when you have to go through a sea of people just to get to your room it is kind of a pain.

Loved the restaurant at this place, Aja, and the waitress was so cool. I can't remember the exact details, but I remember being comped one of the sushi entrees during dinner, solely out of good will from the staff and me being indecisive about whether to order more food.

Very well located.  Very hip but not in an exclusive way that makes you feel like you shouldn't be there.  Kind of awkward going in because you go into their restaurant, Aja, then take the elevator to the second floor.  You can check in via kiosk or sit down at one of their desks.  Lobby is a bit cozy but they make good use of the space.  The rooms. . .comfortable, modern, clean, very well laid out.  And not that I use the mini bar and snack bar but nice to see it filled with creative snacks.  And the service is VERY friendly.  Like ""let me get you a cab"" before you ask friendly.  Like ""did you have a good day"" and really mean it friendly. A word of warning, the higher up the floor, the louder it will be as there is a hip nightclub on the top floor. Overall. . .I would head back here and pay the $100 more per night that it would cost with a normal reservation.

If you want to stay at a hotel for the purpose of relaxing and enjoying their spa, stay somewhere else. Also, the check-in/front desk area is not well organized. Sure, they have kiosks, which didn't work for me or my boyfriend so we waited for someone to check us in at the front desk, which we didn't mind but it took an unreasonably long time.

8/10/2009;U2Py1d6ciLTUdkiPAlH;IU86PZPgTDCFwJEuAg2j7g;"This is my first yelp review of a hotel. All in all the Dana Hotel and Spa was pretty impressive and that is saying a lot coming from someone who worked as a concierge in the hotel business for the last several years. My hospitality experience set the standard pretty high for hotels to live up to but the Dana really performed. Let me first say that this hotel is not for everyone. It would certainly fall into the category of trendy/contemporary, which some people may not enjoy. Think W hotels, only a little less cheesy and without all the lame lingo. I had a king bed in my room that you could melt in. I don't know what it is like to sleep on a cloud but I would imagine it would be similar to the beds here. The shower is the portion of the room that gets a little weird. It's a spa shower and has a full window that you can look out to the rest of the room while getting so fresh and so clean. Being that I was alone during my stay, I loved this because I was able destank myself while catching a rerun of Real Chance at Love. I also think it would be very cool for a romantic getaway with a special someone, but can imagine an akward situation if I were sharing the room for a business trip or something. It would be difficult to shower in peace wondering if your random roommate, creepy Steve from accounting, was checking you out in the buff. They do have an optional curtain for more privacy, but I toggled with it and it doesn't completely protect from a bi curious George who is dying to check out what your junk looks like. The other thing about the shower that I thought was weird was that there was no door. Literally every time I cleansed myself there was water that sprayed outside the designated shower area. I don't know what is trendy or cool about getting the bathroom floor all wet? They may want to rethink that one. Other than the weird shower, the place is top notch. The location is prime and close to pretty much anything someone visiting Chicago would want to see. They don't really nickel and dime you like many other hotels either. Internet was free as was the gym. They don't have continental breakfast but give vouchers for up to $15 dollars each morning for a la carte items from the restaurant. The food there was very good and in my opinion this blows away any continental breakfast I've ever had. Many times at trendy hotels, I feel like the staff seems almost too cool for school but, I didn't get that here. The service was friendly and approachable from the bellman to the concierge. Overall it is a great place. If your looking for a hotel to hold a company retreat or something along those lines I would recommend more traditional lodging. If I was with someone I felt comfortable being seen in my birthday suit I would definitley stay here.";4;11;6;7;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

12/13/2008;WAe;fHS0bQ-l5rHME_xXKQSYXQ;"There's a great joke to be made about putting Santa up in a modern downtown Chicago spa/hotel.  Maybe it's the gift he gets for bringing good cheer. Either way, before I could get geared up to don the red suit, I had to climb into this sleek, mod hotel room. And the result was a couple of days of luxurious bliss that had me grinning like that practical joke where Rudolph thought his nose was on fritz. There were tons of tiny cool touches that made an excellent hotel genuinely fantastic: Jones sodas for my inner indie soda lover, the rain shower set up, the giant bed with overstuffed pillows and the panoramic views that had to be seen to be genuinely appreciated. I stopped in the rooftop lounge one night which was fun, if a little emotionless, but my understanding is that this part is new, so maybe it'll evolve by the next time I head back.  But other than that, the staff I met was terrific, friendly and welcoming. Here's hoping I see ya again soon, Dana!";5;6;6;3;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
12/18/2009;ItZWvvs8xiiGWXrYBY6yVQ;Ep3KDgEF3_WApurnGRi3mA;"I come to Chgo about 1x/month on business, and stayed here for the first time just this week. Net-net, here's what you'll get: ROOM: 3 stars overall. Bathrooms (5 stars) are awesome, with terrific lighting, big mirrors, huge rain shower w/ lots of water pressure and nice amenities. Beds (2 stars) are WAY too softy-plushie, no support, bad pillows and overall not nearly as comfy as the Westin. If you have a bad back or just o/w prefer a firmer mattress, do not stay here, you'll be miserable. Lighting in room (2 stars) is extremely dim, and you have to turn on/off like 5 lamps individually to get maybe 2 candles' worth of lumens. Windows (5 stars) are beautiful though, completely floor-to-ceiling so you have a great view of the city. SERVICE: 5 stars. Valets remembered my name every time I entered/exited the hotel and addressed me as such, welcoming back and forth by name. They were prompt and courteous and overall some of the best I've experienced in any travels, anywhere. RESTAURANT: 5 stars (I only had bfasts there). Solid menu selection that includes organic foods (yay!), fast servce, courteous and professional by all, from hostess to busser to server. They understand the business traveler. FITNESS CENTER: 4 stars. I'm waffling b/w 3-4 but I'll give 'em 4. See my photos of this place, esp since the hotel website itself doesn't showcase it. Enough stuff to get a workout in, two overly fancy, overly fussy machines, but it's new and clean and has big windows and iPod plug ins. Couple quick tips: Ask for a higher floor even-numbered room and you'll get a nice view looking East (towards the lake). Whole Foods is 1/2 block around the corner on Huron, so you'll have a terrific healthy food option within spitting distance!";4;8;4;2;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Friendly service, and bonus chocolate coated fortune cookies on the bed. Fun but unsustainable shower heads in the shower stall. Sorry Lake Michigan. A stool in the shower.... for...? Use your imagination. Also handy for shaving one's legs. The breakfast had all kinds of berries. Berries maketh the day happy. Soft beds with lots of cushions. Frigging ""WEIRD-AS"" things about Dana: A glass wall in the shower stall, with a curtain that can be opened from the outside, for maximum perving potential for gazing at your loved one while they shower, or take a dump. Exposed concrete ceilings in small low-ceiling bedrooms? I know it's trendy and retro to use exposed concrete like in the 60s.... but in a small room the only things that come to mind are ... uh... bunker? prison cell? Not so good things about Dana: No bathtub. Small rooms. Weak wireless signal. The spa services were all booked up, so we couldn't make use of the spa.";3;5;3;5;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

They have a sushi bar with delicious selections of different maki rolls or nigiri. The tuna sashimi was very fresh and delish. The rooms although small are cozy and luxurious. Flat screen tvs and feather beds are a plus, while the bathroom leaves a little to be desired on the layout. The only thing blocking the shower or toilet from sight of the rest of the room is a curtain that opens from the OUTSIDE. (Make sure you aren't here with any pranksters, or you could be in for a very embarrassing moment!) Also, the only way to close the bathroom door is to slide open the clost, which I find very intrusive and impractical. Not a great design. Some of the rooms have a small balcony, and they all seem to have an unfinished concrete ceiling which is clever and though not my taste, is original. There is a spa with several different treatment packages, and I do look forward to taking advantage of it. The staff seems friendly and do not at all have your typical snootiness in a downtown hotel. There is a steakhouse, but I only tried a sampling of mediocre beef. I can't pass judgement on that. All in all this is sure to be another overpriced hotel that will be a great place to ""be seen"" if you're into that sort of thing. Luckily, I'm not.";4;4;4;3;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
6/20/2009;x4X1hJNLiRRbPUys8uurmQ;KO7CuK8p5u4AFGQ7voXe9g;"Love, love, LOVED my room. I got a standard king bed, but the room was very spacious. I think it might have been the floor-to-ceiling windows...even if they did face a high-rise condo building. So don't walk around in your undies, ladies and gentlemen. The shower was uh-mazing with a rain showerhead and see-thru glass wall into the bedroom. Again, don't forget to pull those shades :) Every night while I was gone to dinner, they came and did a turn-down service and left these adorable chocolate-dipped fortune cookies. Me likey! And the gym has the coolest equipment I've ever seen. They have two treadmills with TV, Ipod and Radio options (and personal fans), an elliptical with the same options, and a stair stepper. I think I saw a stationary bike or two. They also have free weights, exercise balls and these wall units that looks like a bow-flex machine. Oh - and they provide ice water and towels so don't worry about bringing your own. The only thing that bothered me during the trip was the elevators. You have to put your card in to get to your floor, and I'm all about safety, but you literally have seconds to do it before the elevator doors shut and you're sent off to whoever pushed a button on their floor. Very frustrating when all you're trying to do is get to your room. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to Dana...the location rocks for getting around.";4;4;2;1;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
8/31/2010;NniPjAnjquZdESxXJO7iTg;BNuSgYmwrJeOxSFan4HM9Q;"Oy, this was a hard one to rate. The abridged version is that this is a 4 star review for solo travelers and exhibitionists.  2 stars if you want to keep a little bit of mystery alive in your marriage. First the good... Beautiful hotel for a good price in a super convenient location.  If I were travelling solo, I would definitely go back.  The staff was very pleasant.  The chocolate covered fortune cookies with turn down service were a nice touch. Service at the restaurant was a little slow - but courteous and the food was good.  The fitness center equipment was more than adequate.  Others have noted the small locker rooms for the spa, but I had a decent massage and enjoyed my time there. If I were staying by myself, this would have been a 4 star review.  I'm still docking one star because I could hear traffic noise on the 18th floor and the elevators were a bit annoying, but generally - great hotel. Which brings us to the not so good... For travelers with companions, this should really be a 2 star review.  Because despite all of the nice amenities, for the love of God, what is up with the pooper? The bathroom shower has a clear glass wall looking out into the room which then looks out onto the lovely views of Chicago.  There is a curtain outside the bathroom to block the view out - or more critically, the view in - if you want a bit of privacy. I can almost give them the clear shower stall.  I can see the appeal of catching your partner washing their hair (I was travelling with my cousin, so the magic was really lost on me - but I see what they were going for). But just past the clear shower, is the clear divider to the toilet.  And there ain't nothing sexy about that.  To add insult to injury, the sliding barn door that doubles as a closet door doesn't close all of the way or stay put. And even if you close the curtain for privacy, in the middle of the night, the entire bedroom will be aglow when you flip on the bathroom light.  So your traveling companion can wake up when you flip on the light in the bathroom, and then lay in bed and listen to you pee because the frackin' door won't close? Who the heck thought that one up?";3;3;1;8;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Basically a shower with a window into the room but to close it the curtain is on the outside of the shower in the bedroom... Everybody working there was great and the rooftop bar/lounge was nice. Security was quick to tell a rowdy room to be quiet when we called to complain at 3:30 in the morning.";4;2;3;3;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
8/4/2008;E3J4KFGYT7bTHqcUoJwlhQ;pIbuh85hbMNKNMvIwVNLrQ;"This is definitely a hotel in its beta launch phase and still needs to figure out some details on their service: In our first room the shower would flood the entire bathroom, but dont worry, they will give you a room with a leakproof shower if you ask for it:-) Our toilet in the first room also did not flush properly. Also, the roof deck they are talking about is not open yet, although promoted on their website & expedia. But these are the only reasons for deducting a star, other than that it was a great experience, especially because they made up in a great way for these little failures. This is what really makes me like them: Great friendly staff, in a very chique hotel (interior is modern & tasty, great coffee in the room), and in the end  mistakes are just human. Admitting and knowing to apologize for them doesnt come naturally to most people and businesses, but they just do it. I also would love it if they had a pool, we had to stare jealously at the roof deck pools of our neighbours :-) But they told us they decided to go for a Spa instead. I think a pool would perfectly complement a Spa like this. The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are comfy, the interior of the rooms as well as the bar/restaurant downstairs is very modern, urban and tasty. Unfortunately we never ate there, its pretty pricey, also for the guests staying at the hotel. As for the hotel: You get great value for the price, if the rate does not exceed 300/night, everything beyond 330 is just too much for what it currently offers and right at the threshold of pain.";4;3;2;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Rooms are a bit executive looking, but the modern flair is fun and wow the shower is fantastic. Be sure to bring your ""honey"" almost for the shower alone. It is an all glass rain shower, so not for the kids. The service was very good. I did stay on off days (Sun - Tues), but the doormen to the front desk personnel seemed to know me every time I came through the lobby.

My room actually reminded me of a studio apartment (a VERY NICE studio apartment), rather than a hotel room. The hardwood floors and desk made it feel like you were coming home at the end of the day...and I like that feeling. The floor-to-ceiling windows were cool (awesome views) but it got to be a pain by day two, as you have to pull down the shades if you want to take a shower, change your clothes, or do anything that you don't want the businessmen in the building next door to see :) OR if you are an exhibitionist, this is the place for you! And I'm still confused as to why the shower is glass on both sides, especially the side closest to the bed. Does someone who's sleeping NEED to see you washing your hair? The privacy curtain takes care of that problem, but I'm wondering why it was built that way originally. Based on the last two hotels that I've stayed in for work, The Curtis and its talking elevators (""I seee youuu"") and now the sexy shower at the Dana... what kind of job did I just sign up for? I kid, I kid... I would absolutely stay at the Dana again, as its location is within walking distance of a lot of great shopping (Hello Michigan Ave!) and cute brunch spots.

The bar downstairs was very posh and packed all night and the Aja Steak restaurant had excellent food and drinks! Some of the decor was kind of random but for the most part is worked. The showers were kind of strange in the locker rooms. Overall, we both enjoyed it and will certainly go back to eat there again. I went back a few weeks ago for a hot stone massage and yes it was amazing!!! The Vertigo Lounge is awesome...and I will take all my out of town guests back to Ajasteak and to Vertigo for a few drinks!

1/23/2011;6od3oz1v;pdxPaFnVObKBq3KjEMZEAg;"The 4 stars are for the hotel tranquility suite and lounge. The spa was horendous, 0 stars. SPA - MASSAGE:  The massage I asked for was a deep tissue massage.  She asked what I wanted the focus on, I said back.   The pressure was too weak.  She spent too much time on the legs and arms and not what I asked for which was my back.   Definitely a waste of money. SPA -FACIAL: I got the microdermabrasion facial. It was OK, But very poor on extractions. SPA facilities- poor, the lockers did not work, I had to switch two times before one worked to lock properly.  The lockers were way to small for winter wear.  There are not enough sink area in the women's spa.  There is not makeup seat area.  The sitting room was too small for the amount of people. The spa handlers did not care or notice that there was not enough room in the seating room. The SPA was very disappointing. However, the HOTEL and Club (Vertigo) were ok,pretty nice. HOTEL- TRANQUILITY SUITE - rm 901 Bathroom- The bathroom mirrors with the built in lights are great.  However, there was no makeup seat in there.  Don't they think what a lady would like? The Shower was very large with two benches.  It is a shower for two and it would have been wonderful if the side jets were working, but they were not.  The water pressure on the handheld jet was extreme and I loved it. Great bathrobe. Bed- too soft. Firm mattress with a euro top is the only way to go. Living room section- Nice flooring.  Nice wine selection. Movie selection was bad, I wanted to see the Facebook movie, but not available.  poor movie selection, needs more intellectual-type, based on true story, movies and more cerebral comedies. 2 balconies, nice views, cute, there was snow on the ledges, awww. I love the amount of light and the different window shading that is available to block out the light. LOUNGE (Vertigo)- very nice bartender. very nice host guys that gave us a blanket when we went outside to sit by the firepit in the external winter bar. kind of cool. Nice view, nice feel to the place. cool without trying too hard or being snobby.  Instead helpful as a place should be to its clientele.";4;1;1;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

We spent about 3 hours there in between using the sauna/steam room and getting our massages, it was a great way to start off the wedding festivities.

First off, the good stuff -- yes, the staff is very hip and pretty friendly, at least at the door and while you're checking in... And the place has a very cool look to it (actually reminds me of my favorite sushi restaurant out in Batavia - Swordfish -- but I digress)... But when you look at things a little closer, it all kind of falls apart a bit. The waitstaff in the downstairs bar, the first floor restaurant, and even the rooftop all seem to be fighting both an urge to be nice when they meet you with a deep desire to run away. For example, at breakfast in the morning, one poor busboy was running around like a madman, cleaning tables, filling coffee cups, and seating people. All while a waiter struggled to figure out how to split a check. I watched one table get their breakfasts from 2 different food runner, then they waited for at least 3 more visits from runners to their table to finish bringing their toast, their fresh fruit - etc. All while the waiter continued to poke at the touch screen. Breakfast was good, by the way. We went to the rooftop bar, where at 5pm there was already cigarette butts on the floor around the outdoor firepit, and the carpet by the stairs was so sticky I had to laugh -- this is a place where you have to reserve a table for bottle service? Four drinks at 5pm at the rooftop bar = $80 The rooms are okay, but some details seem very weird, like the unfinished concrete ceilings. Really? And the huge glassed in shower with the curtain that almost covers the glass -- and the shower head that blows out so much water I realized why they had concrete ceilings and floors (whatever happened to water conservation?)... But by far the scariest part of the whole deal was when we realized that EVERYONE going up to that rooftop bar takes an elevator that could and often does stop on any floor in the hotel. So much for hotel security... Overall, I think maybe I'm not their demographic -- maybe if you're a spa kind of person, this place is very special. For me, not so much.";2;0;1;1;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

12/14/2009;OR6KUFvOa0uvoZT0hgcyyg;xOEeuhX2c-B2S0ZqMKU38Q;"I've stayed at the Dana Hotel several times before; it's one of my favorites in Chicago.  This review, however, is for my spa day I recently had here.  I was treated to one of their 3  1/2 hour packages which included Swedish massage, facial and classic mani/pedi.  The receptionist greeted me when I got there and showed me to the shower/locker room.  It was decent, but I was surprised to see those generic brown paper towels at the sink--the ones that smell when you dry your hands with them.  Totally not a big deal, but this is a spa, after all...  I'll forgive them for that one, though, since the robes were so comfy. Before my first treatment, they took me to the relaxation room, which is kind of an oxymoron because you're stuck in a very very dimly lit room with other people in robes, and it's anything but relaxing.  Worries like, ""am I exposing any bits & pieces,"" etc.  There are some magazines but it's so dark I'm not sure how you're expected to read them. My first treatment was a massage.  It was heavenly...  The pressure was just right and I really liked whatever lotion/oil that was used, because I didn't feel slimy and gross at the end like you sometimes do after a massage.  From there, I had a facial.  I'd never had one before, and I have to say it was my favorite part of the package.  I didn't do anything special, just a regular ""refresher"" since I have relatively sensitive skin.  The woman who did my facial was really good about asking about skin allergies and whatnot.  The facial was very relaxing, too (minus the extraction part).   After my facial, I had a mani/pedi.  Unfortunately, this was my least favorite part of the treatment.  Maybe because I get them regularly and my experience was just standard at the Dana?  Honestly, I prefer my regular neighborhood salon to my experience at the Dana.  The woman went a little overboard with the bubbles; it actually felt like my feet were soaking in Dawn.  Also, the scrub was done really quickly--kind of felt like I got ripped off on that part.  The manicure was just okay, too.   One other thing to note, I'm not sure where, but I somehow got jipped in terms of time.  It was supposed to be a 3.5 hour package, and I was out of there in just 3 hours (maybe even a little less).  The massage and facial felt like they took ample time, so I have a feeling it was the mani/pedi that were a little shorter than advertised.";4;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
5/8/2010;p2LH2nPRF;N0mVci8y9eC4PJJmaZ9ymA;"A fantastic hotel top to bottom. I stayed here for a few nights when I was working a conference at the McCormick center. The room was sleek and modern without being cold. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. I wish my house looked like this. I got a free voucher for breakfast and took advantage of it every morning. The Dana Breakfast (eggs benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham) was amazing. The fruit smoothie was only okay, but good for breakfast on the go. I also ordered food from room service and it was very good. The door person always remembered my name (even days later) and was very friendly. Overall, I experienced great service. Finally, I took advantage of the spa for a hot stone massage. My therapist (Dana) was nice but not chatty and totally professional. It was a good massage, but not the best I've ever had. However, the price was lower than I am used to paying in SF, so I was satisfied. I really would recommend this place for anyone looking for something in this area of Chicago. It's chic, not expensive, and really nice.";5;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
9/14/2009;K-M-RaC0Jraxgupkfyyriw;P8WvJMqW2wapw6MAUcLgjQ;"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights while in town for some meetings in the Near Northside area. I can agree with much of what's been said by other reviewers both good and bad: comfy beds, great location, very friendly staff, cool modern rooms, etc.; lack of windows in rooms with basically useless ""balconies"", issues with room temperature, frustrations with the keys and the various elevators, etc. That said, the biggest reason I have to mark this place down is, again as others have mentioned, the paper thin doors and walls. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night when people were out enjoying themselves and coming back fairly late. No big deal. But even at normal talking volumes, not yelling, it sounded like anyone in the hall was actually in our room. It was impossible to sleep. Even the sirens outside sounded much louder than seemed normal. I actually tried shoving pillows at the bottom of the door to dampen the sound. It helped a little, but didn't really help us sleep (since it was still pretty loud and we were now short a couple pillows). It's a fun and interesting place at first, but clearly function (the function of sleeping, which is primarily what a hotel is for in my opinion) lags far behind form in this place. I would not stay here again.";2;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
8/16/2010;60Z3WMKSpR9QHSlXJmp2HQ;J7O_t9n7BIObBV0AmdlCqw;"(NOTE: REVIEW FOR SPA ONLY) A friend and I decided that we wanted to treat ourselves to massages. It was a last minute decision so we called around until we found open appointments. This is how we ended up at The Spa at the Dana Hotel. When we arrived, we stepped off the elevator onto the Spa level and so far, we liked what we saw. The waiting area and hallways were very tranquil looking and contemporary. We checked in and we were told that we could use the stream room in the locker area before our massages. Having had massages at other Spa's, like Bliss (or The Elysian, Peninsula, Exhale, Urban Oasis, etc.), we were really excited to use the locker room amenities. Upon entering, we lost our excitement. The locker rooms here are tiny. Two restrooms, one small steam shower and maybe three showers. On the counter was one hair dryer and typical spa amenities - a few razors, some mouthwash, toothbrush/toothpaste, comb, deodorant and lotion. The atmosphere was nothing special. It was sort of a mess, even though no one else was in there. The ceiling was peeling and there were black stains on the wall (um, mold?!). We were disappointed. Needless to say, we didn't spend too much time in the locker room. We put on our robes and walked to the ""relaxation"" room, a dimly lit room with a few chairs and chaises to sit in while you wait for your masseuse. We were served strawberry-cucumber infused water. They had magazines and fruit to enjoy. The room was comfortable, but we still felt like we wouldn't want to see it with the lights turned all the way up. With all that being said, the massages were pretty decent. We booked 50 minute, $90 Swedish massages. The massage tables were comfortable, the masseuse was friendly and I did leave feeling relaxed. Would I go back to the The Spa at The Dana Hotel? Probably not. With all of the massage options in the city, I'd probably stretch my wallet to go somewhere else or spend my $90 in another way. I'm a sucker for great spa amenities, and sadly, this one didn't live up to my expectations.";2;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

3/25/2010;sYhmW0sKCcJCqdwnQIoYWA;jK_AkKMEXd-3mljsknsPzw;"Starting from the doorman, the staff at the Dana is pretty damn friendly.  The girls at the registration desk were honest, congenial and humorous, even though some white-collar accountant-looking-type was being handcuffed right behind me while checking in.  Seriously.  (Although I never found out what led to that.) The lobby, the lobby bar and the adjacent restaurant are all small and relatively quiet, but definitely have a ton of style.  In fact, the entire hotel was far too cool for me, specifically, and probably too cool for most of humanity. The Tranquility Suite was simply awesome-- 2 rooms (a bedroom and a huge living room), 2 tiny balconies with amazing views (ask for a higher floor unless you have severe vertigo), and a nice bathroom with an unbelievable shower for two.  Seriously, this room offered the best shower imaginable-- complete with 2 rain-style shower heads, 2 benches (for the ladies of course), a set of high-powered jets, and a handheld thingy that spits out mad amounts of water.  This shower is definitely not ""green"", but it's the sort of place that makes you not want to leave.  Finally, the bedding is tremendous-- it's hard to imagine feeling more comfortable in a hotel bed. All in all, the Dana appears to be designed to make you not want to leave your room (or the spa for that matter).";5;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Really felt like someones condo. I could totally live there. The shower was an experience. I'm so glad they persuaded me to get in. I didn't want to get out!!

6/6/2009;R6fvEEGmcLSCPh1wgc6Nrw;YSfAlm6XNaym-JOrRjv3Tg;"I have to admit that I was pretty stoked about my stay here after reading all of the reviews. I'm a sucker for a great hotel. Check-in was a breeze, although I'm really not a fan of the whole ""let's put your whole stay on hold on your credit card when you get here to cover incidentals"" policy. That certainly isn't fun for those of us on strict budgets, although I guess that's not the typical patron at the Dana. I absolutely LOVED the mosaic behind the check in desk, and would kind of like it for my apartment, please. Thank you. My stay at the Dana (for 5 whole nights) was overall a pleasure. Todd, the bartender downstairs, took great care of us on a VERY regular basis and would whip my Hendrick's and tonic up without having to ask. God, I loved that bar. Comfortable seating, free tasty fried wontons, and Hendrick's gin. Love. Who cares if it's $10 a cocktail, right? My room was a study in form over function. The desk space was great and I used it often. The bed was comfortable, although it didn't hold a candle to the palatial heavenly beds at the Westin. My main beef was with the bathroom. As others have mentioned, the shower is all glass and opens up to your room, which is fine for those of us who travel solo. Just have to put the blinds down, and as someone who loves to live by natural light, that became a pain. The other side of the shower has NOTHING. No door, no glass, so you're just open to the bathroom, resulting in water flying everywhere. Maybe I'm just a really sloppy shower-er, but I felt really bad for housekeeping who had to deal with my sopping wet bathmat. It also led to things getting pretty drafty, which I could  imagine being a serious issue come cold Chicago winter. Finally, the rain-style showerhead. I know these are all the rage, but I don't like them. As someone who doesn't wash my hair every day (but still likes to shower) it provides some difficulty. Sure, they've still got the handheld thing, but who the hell wants to use that? Plus, it added even more to the mess beyond the shower walls. It wasn't pretty. Finally, be sure not to get a room across from the elevator (rooms that end in 08 or 10). You will here the dinging all.night.long. Not to mention all the folks that chat it up while waiting for the lift to arrive. Not fun if you like extreme peace and quiet. Would I come back to the Dana? Sure, as long as work is paying or I get an insane deal. Otherwise you can find me on a friend's couch or at the Days Inn in the 'burbs.";4;6;5;2;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
2/21/2011;ABEWAQ4dx8OosIypS8ZUIQ;JGiTNFb_Ib-PoW6_HLg-oQ;"Oh my goodness! I had the best experience at the Dana Hotel. I want to mention that I did not go to the SPA (though I hope to in the future!) so this is a review for the hotel only. For my birthday this year my boyfriend decided to do a special ""date night"" downtown. He is really good at planning things like this and after a lot of research he decided on Dana Hotel for our place to stay. When we arrived they valeted our car. Every staff person that we interacted with was helpful and friendly. The decor of the hotel is very beautiful and modern. There was a huge tour group checking in when we arrived so the manager took us aside to get us checked in. They also have self serve kiosks for check in. Our room was not ready so they set us up with a free drink at the bar while we waited. I thought that was really good customer service. The room was AH-mazing. If you decide to stay there I highly suggest that you choose a corner room. The first thing that hits you when you walk in are the floor to ceiling windows. The beds are so comfy and plush, the bathroom is awesome and has a rain shower! I took 4 showers and was only there one night. It has all the amenity's of a nice hotel, robe and slippers, nice bath products, etc. We also liked that it had an awesome ipod docking station with really good speakers. Overall it was an amazing room and well worth the price of $160. We had stayed at a holiday inn express a couple weeks before which cost $100 per night. $60 more for this room was a great deal if you ask me. We stayed in January so I am guessing the price might be more in a peak season? While we were there we also went to the roof top bar. It was really cool, not too crowded, and there was an outdoor patio with an ice bar! I also liked that there was a fire pit to sit around with complimentary robes to wear, so you could sit by the fire outside on the roof and not be cold. There were a few things to be aware of, though it wouldn't make me drop my rating. The valet is $40 per night and when you get the room charge they add tax. The drinks at the bar are really expensive, $15 or more for a cocktail. So keep that in mind. Either way, I know that if we do another date night downtown I will ask if we can stay there again, we loved it!";5;0;1;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
9/2/2008;WkT0wv;-NF_GtaaanlNjHV3MfJ9pA;"My fiance and I decided to have a little faux-getaway on Sunday night. Although we live only a few blocks from the Dana, we thought it would be a fun way to close out the summer to book a hotel, do the whole spa thing, shop Michigan avenue like tourists, and enjoy some of the things in Chicago that we take for granted since we live here. We had high hopes for our stay and were excited to get a move on, Sunday morning. Upon booking, we were told that check-in is 3PM (normal) but that we should have no problem having our room by 12-1. We got to the hotel about 1230 and were told they sold out the night before and we'd have to wait until 3 for our room. Not their fault, totally understood, so we left our bags with the bellman and went shopping. My fiance had booked a massage earlier in the week for 2PM and at about 1PM she called to see if she could get a last minute manicure after her spa treatment. The manicurists were booked (understandable) but she was also told they had no record of her massage!?!?! - this had been confirmed by phone a day earlier. The massage was one of the things she was most looking forward to, so after a brief phone argument, we marched back to the hotel to get it straightened out. Luckily they ""found her reservation"" and she was off to her massage. I went back out to do some shopping and met up with her at 3PM to check in. We were told the room STILL wasnt ready, but somehow they managed to find us one that fit our reservation. The room was what we expected, small, but modern and cool. The IPOD system was excellent and the bed was super comfy. We requested a room with a balcony as opposed to their floor to ceiling windows - either way the hotel is very open with regards to people in neighboring buildings being able to see in and we received welcoming waves from people across the way. Luckily the blackout blinds do the trick in securing some privacy. I'm thinking that the upcoming portion of my review on Ajasteak should go under the restaurant, so if you happen to read something on that page that seems oddly familiar, you'll know why. Going into the restaurant, I had moderate expectations given that its fairly new and some of the reviews seemed ""eh"". We had an 8PM reservation and were clearly on time since we were just an elevator away. When we arrived, we were told they werent ready for us yet and to enjoy a cocktail at the bar - should be 15-20 minutes. I looked into what I assumed was the restaurant and there were only two tables out of probably 15 occupied and a few parties eating outside. I assumed there was another section of the restaurant that couldnt be seen from the bar area, but when we were seated in what turned out to be the empty restaurant I was BAFFLED. I ran to the bathroom when we were seated (have to take elevator/stairs to 2nd floor bathroom, none on restaurant level) - but the manager came to the table and apologized to my fiance for the wait - apparently they were extremely short staffed, backed up in the kitchen, and had a private party ""upstairs"". New restaurant kinks or shitty service??? The menu was on par with what I expected. We started with edamame (decent, but kind of flavorless) and the Kobe beef yakatori. I'm SO GLAD I opted for the Kobe beef appetizer as opposed to the $18 per oz entree as it was REALLY sub-par. It was served with mini-skewer/toothpicks to eat it with and kind of came across as something that would be served as passed appetizers at a cocktail party. Unimpressive. My fiance ordered the sea bass which she generally loves.Sea bass isnt normally a ""fishy"" fish and it is usually hearty/fluffy. However, her piece was pounded so thin, it was almost laughable and it was drenched in the terriyaki sauce (which although tasty) seemed an intentional overpowering of the sub-par fish. I opted for the lamb chops and upon ordering told the server that although I enjoy my steaks medium rare, I prefer lamb cooked a bit more and he acknowledged my request - OF COURSE, the lamb came out pretty much rare and both chops had a big visible piece of fat through the middle. This was a $40 dish that was worth 1/2 that, if that. I ate it because at that point I was starving. We also shared the ""truffle"" mashed potatoes which didnt have a hint of truffle flavor and tasted more like the buttered flavor out of the bag instant mashed potatoes found at the local Jewel for $0.89. Dismal. Clearly, we didnt stick around for dessert. Fortunately, my fiance and I know how to have fun even when faced with some shitty circumstances, so although on paper the overall experience of the Dana seems terrible, we made the best of it. When we left, our first thought was, ""We're so F'in happy the Dana wasnt opened last year when we booked our wedding at the James hotel"". On the surface the Dana seems to have every thing we like - spa, cool, modern decor, location, trendy restaurant, etc - but they definitely missed the mark with us.";2;2;0;1;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
7/5/2009;fqYlUhbsp38DnnJ9vygKEQ;Jrw9KbRmBufcfr_cNqcMEg;"My wife, who just so happens to be named Dana, spent our first weekend alone since our first child was born eight weeks ago. I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews. I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests. 1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didn't seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway. 2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend. 3. If possible, an upper level room with a view. Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically ""We're booked, too bad"". When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldn't be a problem, their response was again ""Your room doesn't come with a refrigerator, too bad."" I've never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasn't exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend. Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again. POSITIVES 1. Location. You can't beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife ... You are right in the middle of all of it. 2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place. 3. Shower. It's a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. It's about as nice of a hotel bathroom as you're going to find. 4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good. 5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine. NEGATIVES 1. Front desk. I've already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting. 2. Elevator. This might sound like I'm being picky, but I can't tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done. It's almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. It's incredibly annoying and if you don't do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotel's way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off. 3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isn't the hotel for you. 4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. It's not young by any means and it's not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter. 5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you it's on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, I'll be impressed. There are a lot of things at this hotel where you just scratch your head and think, what the @#$% were they thinking?";3;3;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
8/7/2011;7-2xb3VqeKzTF7QxXuUieg;LXGuXkKMFeZ4T4-I3GoGaw;"Visually, The hotel is modern, creative and pretty. However, it's good design does not make up for the so-so staff.-I only saw one employee, a bellman, dark man with braids, who provided exceptional service. I watched him from the bar as he kept guests dry from the rain, continually keeping the elevator ready, and carrying luggage with a smile. The bar wasn't busy and the nice bartender unfortunately couldn't multitask well. **the elevator requires your room key and it continually didn't register with many guests.. And one point, it wouldn't work for a bellman. The elevator wouldn't allow me to go to the Vertigo room either.. That was frustrating and I tried both days. I didn't ask the staff for help b/c like I said, they didnt really seem that helpful. I did love the comfy king room. The bed itself felt like heaven. There was a personal patio and an awesome shower. The layout of the room was creative. It felt as if you were in a loft.";3;1;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

9/26/2009;Ve8sYBlC9wReVGz93tPoKQ;wSJqJDnrOulV8C5niQPoYQ;"Overall, my wife and I were pretty pleased with Dana, the room, the spa and the restaurant downstairs.  Not to mention the friendly and helpful staff.  We stayed in the Tranquility Suite for two nights (Fri/Sat), parked our car with the valet, partook in a variety of spa treatments, ordered room service, used the in room honor bar, and also had dinner and breakfast at Aja, the restaurant downstairs. The Room (4 Stars): Price was reduced by 15% b/c we stayed two nights.  We also got 60 dollars credit toward breakfast in their restaurant when we arrived.  Nice surprise and bonus.  Decor is pretty cool and the rooms are unique and spacious. The Italian Rain Shower totally rocks and having the sitting room in the Tranquility Suite was really worth it. Plugged in our iPhones to the speaker dock and enjoyed our music.  Fair prices for the bottles of wine in the room and a decent selection from the small frig (though adding small bottles of some liquors would have been nice).  Having two balconies was pretty cool, especially to have some air flow through the room.  Window treatments block the sun really well, like really really well.  Downside  - Bed was too soft and we did not sleep as well both nights.  Balconies are good to have a smoke on and take some pictures but other than that there's not much room and you have to pull a small chair out there if you want to enjoy it. My guess is that liability and insurance dictated this...oh well. Just don't look forward to a real balcony.  Very limited cable television with Showtime that's not HD even though the room has two widescreen flat panel TVs.  Also, you can't order movies to watch in your room because they don't have the service. Aja (the restaurant) (5 stars) - Pretty chique decor, fairly priced (on the higher end) and good quality food.  For dinner I ordered some salmon sushi rolls and sashimi and they were both very good (and I'm reeeeeal picky 'bout my sushi).  My wife did the pork chop and mashed potatoes...and they were both delicious.  Pork chop was a large portion as were the mashed potatoes.  We also had a bottle of Silver Oaks' Merlot to celebrate ($108 and well worth it, great Merlot).  Then we had their apple desert that was both beautifully presented and nicely balanced in size, flavor and freshness.  Our server was great too.  Really personable, fun to joke around with and down to earth.  Some staff members/servers seemed a little uptight or anxious and I'm wondering if that might be a reflection of how they're managed...?  Breakfasts were a little high priced for me but having the 15 dollar credit, 1 for each of us, we were happy to go down.  Again, very fresh and good quality food.  Locks were flavorful, Eggs benedict had a fresher flavor as they increased the amount of lemon (which I welcomed) and their potatoes were very delicious.  Refrain from ordering the pancakes unless you want to feed 4-5 people.  For some reason they give you two that are two times the size of a large dining plate...no joke, it's friggin' ridiculous. Hope they change it. The Spa (3.5 Stars) - My wife and I had the couples message and pedicures together.  She also had a manicure and facial.  She really enjoyed her massage and I did as well although I have some hefty knots in my shoulders so I was sore and a little bruised the next day.  Overall, it was a good experience but speak up if they're doing it too hard and if their nails are scratching you.  The bed you lay on is heated, super comfy and dark lit room and the oils that they use are pretty nice.  You also sit in a relaxing room before and after to chill out.  Pedicures were pretty good though we felt a little misled because the woman recommended treatments but did not tell us that they weren't included and that we'd be charged extra so watch out for that.  Besides that it was pretty good.  Quality of the nail polish and durability was a little questionable.  Seemed to wear off pretty quickly and she rushed through it a bit.  Again, pretty good with room for improvement.  My wife really enjoyed the manicure (same rating and experience as the pedicure) and LOVED the facial (she got the Antioxidant/Nutrient facial). Parking, Concierge, Room Service and Bell Hop (4.5 Stars): the staff was really nice here.  Pleasant, helpful, talkative and personable.  When we pulled up to the hotel we did not have to do much. We were greeted immediately, given a ticket for our car for valet, they removed out luggage immediately, placed it on a cart and took it upstairs while we checked in.  A little delay on the checkout but that's because many people were doing so all at once.  Same great service.  Room service was easy and has food 24 hours, which really impressed us.  Prices are a bit high but that's no big surprise.  We were happy to pay considering their prices on other things were pretty reasonable.  Concierge was more than helpful in making reservations at Aja for us.";4;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

The first night the maid turned down the beds and pulled the shades, but neglected to pull the blackout shades; an important feature when you are in an east facing room...and we didn't know to do it ourselves.  The second night, they were pulled, but the maid threw the pillows on the chair next to them so there was a nice crack for that sun to peek through, right into my friends eyes.   A nice touch is that they give you coupons for a made to order breakfast in their downstairs restaurant - valued at $15.00.  So in the morning we went downstairs for breakfast...it was busy...we waited...once we sat...we waited...and waited...can someone PLEASE bring us some coffee???? Oh, sure...we waited...and waited...can we say, the service was slow?  Yes, yes we can.  The food was mostly good; again a couple of missteps and inconsistencies; I assume the kitchen makes their poached eggs in advance, using the method of putting the egg into an ice bath to hold it until service and then putting it into hot water to warm and finish cooking; it's an important step, that putting it back into hot water; when it's not done, the egg is a cold as ice.  As was the eggs on my friend's Eggs Benedict. However, the poached eggs on my other friends plate were hot. This was, however, something that was quickly corrected.  The second morning was no better than the first on service...it was slow, and worse, it's like they are ignoring you.  They don't even make eye contact.  That morning I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy...let me say this...clearly...DON'T...it's not Biscuits and Gravy, it's a biscuit in some white stuff with some slices of sausage and mushrooms...that's just not right.   I do want to give a shout out to TJ and the guy with the Tats, (sorry can't remember your name) you guys were great! LindySez: It's a nice place to stay, central to many sites, comfortable, and the food is good...just don't expect it any time soon.";3;0;0;0;N;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

We had tried to book a massage at the hotel spa, but they were booked, so the concierge also booked us at a nearby spa at a discounted price. A+ service.

It's really not that bad, people. Our double-bed room was up on the 14th floor, the top floor. From the reviews, it sounds like we lucked out, and maybe some of the more unkempt rooms are on the lower floors. Try requesting a higher room. Ours was way bigger than expected. The bed sheets were clean, the mattresses were firm. It was quiet. The TV was small but worked just fine. The bathroom was huge. We thought the a/c was fine - but we were also in Chicago for a stretch of amazing mid-70s days. Staff was always courteous. Sadly, no ghosts greeted us during our stay :( Even when we peeked onto the 13th floor. (Yes, they have a 13th floor.) Yeah, the hallways are a bit old-fashioned. But they aren't as badly lit as I was led to believe. They just seemed like...well, the hallways in an older hotel. The outside window-view from the hallways is definitely Shining-esque, though. But we thought that was cool. Location could not be better, right on Michigan Ave across from the fountain, easy 10 minute walk to Millennium Park, even easier 25 minute walk to Soldier Field. Please note: we didn't have a car with us, so I can't comment on their valet situation. We were also two people in a two double-bed room, so I can't comment on their efficiency in bringing up a cot, extra towels, etc. (Our room was equipped with four towels, and the towels were replaced after house-cleaning even though we didn't request it.) We requested a mini-fridge, and they brought it up promptly even though it was after midnight. I don't know, maybe my opinion on ""old"" and ""dirty"" has been skewed after staying in some rotten New York apartments. But I thought the Congress was fine for the price, and I would stay here again without hesitation. And yes, people are still on strike here. But the group is about 5 - 10 people, and they never once hassled us when we saw them. A note to business travelers: there is a daily charge for Wi-Fi.";4;0;0;0;N;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

No late night room service!  For me this is a downer.  I love getting room service at 2 a.m. and for a hotel in that area it is really a shame.  I did order room service, but I didn't feel the choices were that great.  I got chicken strips and fries, so it's hard to really judge...what do you expect.  I will say that Hardee's has better chicken strips.  These were over-breaded.  I think I paid $15 for an order of five with fries.  I understand room service comes with a cost, so I got what I expected. 4. No internet without extra charge.  This is something that really aggravates me about higher-end hotels.  I can go to the Super 8 and get free Internet service that works great, but then when I stay at ""better"" places they try to charge me $15-25 extra a day.  With the cost of Internet being what it is today, I know it isn't that costly and there are ways to secure it so not everyone is using it without being a guest.  I find it ridiculous.  I know there are some costs to the initial installation, etc. however, who doesn't use the internet?  I use my mobile hotspot on my Droid and it works fine, but I'm still grouchy about this and it's not just with this hotel.   5.  Service was friendly, but my room wasn't made up until 4:00 pm on the days I was there.  I just like to have it done while I'm out and not come back to the room and it still not be finished.  I know, it's a minor complaint, but that's what's important to me.

I opted to stay here because I read it was one of the most haunted hotels in all of chicago. Unless the shrieks from the nearby blue line rail are the cries of restless spirits, i'd say the only real fright is the lack of air conditioning.

What is this, 1998? They are grasping at the past to prove their greatness, but everything looks like just that, including the strangely dressed staff. Everything looks like it should be cool, like in a wes anderson sort of way, but it falls short and comes off more as ironic than anything else. You know me, I am not above spending nights in my car, but as it is a dream of mine to live in a hotel and have a driver, this falls quite short of my vision. It lacks any sort of real charm.

Call me a nerd, but if you research a bit of it's back story, it's really a neat destination. It is an 1893 building that has hosted numerous celebrities, notorious historical figures, and presidents.

The place would be well served if some dollars were reinvested into a bit of a makeover. The place is filthy, the carpet is smelly and it just looks old and dated. It wasn't our choice to stay here, but since I snoozed on signing up for the Chicago Marathon, I had to go through Marathon Tours for an entry and the only available hotel left was this one- so we checked out the reviews before we arrived and were totally mortified by them. The A/C wasn't working in our room and based on the dismal service described in the other reviews, we decided against calling the front desk to report it. Thankfully it was cool enough in the evenings and we were able to open the windows despite the fact that it was the 14th floor. The fresh air did wonders to dissipate the musty smell from the room and the cool nights made it for comfortable stay despite the sound of the L train passing by every few minutes and the random sirens blaring somewhere in the city.

This strike has been going on for YEARS. That is NOT OKAY. Based on what I knew of the strike, I decided to stay at the Hilton down the street. From what I heard, it was the better choice as other people at the conference staying at the Congress reported that their electricity kept going out, and their bathrooms were having issues. Also, some of the girls thought the rooms were haunted and after a night there, decided to stay elsewhere. Yeah, even at the conference rate of $99/night, no thanks!";1;9;5;4;N;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

I can get a top shelf cocktail mixed by an expert at the Violet Hour for $11, and this incompetent douchewad charges us $14 for a drink he didn't even know how to make. If this wasn't bad enough, filthy glasses and empty bottles littered almost every table in the bar. It's nothing short of a miracle that they have customers in here.

The Congress Plaza Hotel is a total crap hole (yes, that is the technical term). Having lived on the south side previously, it's not the neighborhood that gets me. It's the fact that the hotel is full of employees who don't want to be there (scabs, by the way... The real employees have been on strike for years, and they picket in front every day), classless hotel guests, and security personnel who look like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, complete with the post-being-in-the-saddle waddling they do. I (luckily) only crashed in a friend's hotel room there during the conference I was attending, but I wouldn't have paid for a room there. They're dirty, the views are terrible, and the hallways are oddly-shaped and confusing. It's like a labyrinth when you get inside. At 1AM, I was standing in the lobby with a gin and tonic when all of a sudden a man ran past me gushing blood out of some orifice in his face (It might have been his nose or eye, or a hole that had recently appeared judging by the amount of blood it had pouring out of it). He ran into the elevator, which he then proceeded to cover in blood as well. To ""outrun"" the security guards who were now chasing him around, he got off at around the 8th floor, called the OTHER elevator, then took that one back down to the lobby and ran outside, covering both elevators, as well as the entire hotel lobby with blood. That was the highlight of my evening... Hiking up the 12 flights to get back to the room I was staying in because both elevators were covered in hemoglobin. Last, the security guard from the hotel, having seen me in the lobby during the blood fiasco, figured out which room I was going into and had me LOCKED OUT of it so he could question me when I ran up the stairs. He had to go override the lock to make the keys work again. I think that was probably illegal. That's when I gathered my belongings and took the hour-long train ride home instead of staying with my friend again. The CP hotel tries to be high class, but they really aren't. They're notorious for charging huge amounts for ""amazing suites"" that really aren't that great. For the same money, you could go to a real hotel and not be harassed by the people on strike every time you walk in the front door by someone who's been unemployed and striking for 3 years. If you're under age 50, watch out for the RCMP... They really hate ""them damn college kids."" They'll follow you to your room.";1;2;2;9;N;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

I travel a lot for work.  Like most of the week, most every week.  The fact that I know hotels is a given. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  (and when I was under 18 working for a small company with no hotel reservation in Houston, there was NO VACANCY anywhere, and I had to stay in a place that rented rooms by 15 minute increments and had mirrors on the ceiling. Not joking.  Horrid.) If I had the option, I would stay in a Motel 6.  I am not kidding.  There just isn't one close enough. I am not sure where to start.  Paint is peeling from everywhere.  Carpets appear to have been stained since the 70's.  Water pressure is low, and showerheads seem to have been made for midgets.  The halls are not even air conditioned.  This is even a problem when it's 60 degress outside and beautiful.  Saying the rooms ""have a smell"" is generous.  They reek.  Bathrooms have warped doors that rarely close, missing tiles from everywhere, stains on the walls/toilets/tubs. The lights dim when you plug a freaking iron in.  *IF* you can find a plug that doesn't appear to want to shock you.  Also, it seems to be impossible to cool the rooms to a reasonable temperature for sleeping. And lo and behold, they have internet access?!  Oh wait.  It's corded and the cord is 3 feet long.  And no desk.  I'm not sure how I am supposed to use this.  And it's $10.  What the frick, can you say table steaks?   I'm down with classic hotels.  I'm in Chicago, of course there are cool old buildings.  However, someone of influence needs to contact the owners of this hotel and let them know that ""old and disgusting"" does not equal ""classic and classy"". I don't like giving bad reviews.  But this place is a stinker. Update: Added a couple pictures of the bathroom in what is actually my nicest room I've been in.";1;4;2;6;N;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

Downstairs you'll find a game room, a bar/lounge, a restaurant and a gift shop. There's also access to Internet, if you fork over the monies. The lobby, along with the room, is clean. This place has character. If you prefer to stay in super upscale places with a modern touch, don't book your room here. This place is full of history and class.

Our view was of the back not the much advertised Buckingham fountain view.GF3y There were picketers out in front our whole stay.  One of them was very obnoxious and vulgar as we passed with our 15 year old.  Most of the time they were just in the way not letting people pass.   Front desk service?  Just 'meh' at best.   We were in the room when housekeeping came and she asked if I preferred if she came back later or not at all (with hope in her voice) and when I told her later it was very obvious that is not the answer she wanted.

But it's clear where they cut corners to save money. The beds were nice but there were only foam pillows. There were plenty of towels (once we asked) but they were relatively small, very thin and pretty scratchy. The shower curtain was hung on a straight tension rod that was too far INTO the tub - and of course, it came down when I tried to move it away so as not to have the plastic curtain plastered to my, er, behind as I showered. I got it into the right place with the help of my roommate. The rooms are SPACIOUS but the view (on the 5th floor) was of a massive concrete wall - a little ""view"" of brick buildings when you looked straight up. The worst part was the musty smell, and the old-ness. When I went to adjust the thermostat/fan, the little metal ""flap"" revealed filth/stickiness/cobwebs inside, I didn't want to touch the knobs. Our closet (we were in #547) was big and roomy, but our adjoining room (#551) had a weird DOOR that started about 4' off the ground and was probably 3 or 4' tall. Inside (of course we looked!) were old pipes and cobwebs and some trash at the bottom. I believe this was access to plumbing. We think the worst of the smells came from behind that door. So we took everything out of the closet in 551 and moved it to 547, as we had both rooms and the door in between stayed unlocked. There were layers and layers of paint on all of the wood (except the new wood molding along the floor in 551 that had not yet been painted), and much of the paint was peeling. The bathroom was updated but the handicap bar between the sink and the commode was a great place to stub ones toes - it's just in a weird place. The carpet was ornate but old, made me wonder when it was cleaned last. Wish I'd brought my slippers! Other friends had a big ""double room"" on the 13th floor that had no smell. A big room with a king bed, and a separate room with a double bed. The separate room was teeny tiny but it did have a window and it's own flat screen TV, but no furniture, just the bed. I think that room number was 1381/1381A. Haunted? Some of my roommates went on a Chicago Ghost and Red Light District Tour, and found out that the Congress Plaza is the MOST haunted hotel in Chicago (and the 2nd most haunted hotel in the USA!).

1/2/2012;jy1Nq3QFXB3KlevBcrD6zw;wlm-UggdoRzy26g1I51TVA;"AVOID THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL AT ALL COSTS! When we arrived there, the building architecture was undoubtedly fascinating, it soon became obvious that the hotel is not being properly maintained. Setting the dirty carpets and dark, dirty, hallways aside, our first disturbing discovery was an unlocked door on the 7th floor next to the vending area. This unlocked door opens into a shaft used for plumbing and other infrastructure, however, one, especially, a child, could easily fall down to the lower floors and be seriously injured or killed. It shocks me that the hotel can remain in operation with such serious safety hazards. At approximately 11:20 p.m., we discovered a BED BUG in the bed in one of our rooms! We immediately gathered the evidence, took pictures, and called the front desk. The front desk did not seem surprised by our discovery and acted as if we were inconveniencing them! The front desk sent a security officer to the room at approximately 11:40 p.m., who also did not act surprised. The officer had us fill out a security report and took pictures of the bug. The security officer advised us that the manager will move one room. Since we had three rooms on the floor, two of which were adjoining rooms, we went to the front desk, with the bug, to request that all of our rooms are moved. Again, the night manager acted as if we were inconveniencing him. He first advised us that the hotel was almost to capacity and that we would not get three rooms together on another floor. Like magic, however, the new rooms that we received were all in the same hallway, on the same floor, two of which were again adjoining! We checked our new rooms thouroughly for any bed bugs and did not find any. We then went to bed, but did not get much sleep with the thought that bed bugs could be just feet away. What a way to spend New Year's Eve! The next morning, I called American Express Travel to report the issue. After an hour of busy signals and getting disconnected, I eventually spoke with a supervisor, explained the issue, and requested a full refund for our three rooms. The AmEx supervisor called the hotel's manager on duty, Francine, on a three-way call. Francine said that she would call me back shortly with more information. She never called me back and I went to the front desk to follow-up. She said that she was authorized by the hotel's general manager, Shakeel Siddiqu to refund one room and I reported that it was unacceptable. We asked her to call Shakeel back and explain the situation again. She went into the office and supposedly called him back, however, I do not believe that she did. She again said that they would refund one room and would need to call American Express Travel to discuss the issue further. I then asked for a copy of the security report that was filed the night before. She told me that the security office would not give her a copy, but they would give me a copy. I proceeded to the security office in the basement of the hotel and was told that they would not give me a copy of the report until it was reviewed by the director of security. The security personnel is a total joke and more concerned with pointing out wrongs in their colleagues than helping customers. They provided the report number only and said that they would fax the report later. Ultimately, it is obvious that the hotel's lack of concern for its guests stems directly from the hotel's shady owners and all the way through the incompetent management. I do not think a single member of their staff has any idea was customer service is. I also doubt they know they are working in a service industry! After checking out of the hotel, I performed some due dilligence on the hotel. I wish I would have done so before our stay, rather than trusting American Express Travel. I found that our story is not by any means new or isolated.

6/14/2010;OoCcQppmjRFvggpGTVz7oA;wWJ9wtiIsbc5jdcxn9ywvg;"In a desperate situation to secure downtown Chicago hotel room for a recent work conference I was thrilled to land a 'lake view king' accommodation at the Congress Hotel. Due to the late nature of my reservation and the time frame I needed to be in Chicago, I don't think I would have found an alternative to the Congress Hotel even if I had read the Yelp warnings about this place. Let me start by saying that the one star rating is low for the location; located right on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park you are in a great spot for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants. That said, the one star rating is much too high for the Congress Hotel itself. Upon pulling up to the hotel we had to dodge a picket line and were essentially verbally assaulted by a rude valet who only said to ""immediately unload our car"" so he could ""get it out of the way"". Nice. Check in went smooth and the view from our room was incredible. Unfortunately that view would only be ours until we realized the toilet did not work at all, unless you call flooding the bathroom and room entrance working. Our first call to the front desk to request a move to a new room was met with, ""we will send up someone to repair and clean."" Repair and clean translated into a guy with a plunger and a woman with a bucket, spray bottle and paper towels. Not acceptable. Our second call, with some stronger language, resulted in a move to a double bed special with a brick wall view. So much for the view. It was in that room that we noticed the cheap furniture which was essentially broken, gouged and dusty. Nice. As far as the food goes, just stay away, the Gazebo restaurant for breakfast at was terrible as was the service. All this for the price of approximately $260 per night...what a deal! It is a shame to see what the current owners have done to this once grand hotel. It is clear that the place must have been a spectacular place to stay back in its day. One can only hope a reputable organization buys this property out of bankruptcy (which I am guessing is in the near future) and really does something outstanding with it.";1;3;0;1;N;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

My last stay was one of the most horrible hotel stays I've ever had, and I've stayed in the Ramada Inn in Inglewood, CA! The problem with Congress Plaza is, they have two seperate wings. The original wing is mostly okay. The rooms are really old, but most are roomy and the dilapidated nature is part of the charm. The ""Buckingham Wing"", which was apparently a value hotel next door bought out by the Congress some years ago, and never renovated, is a f-cking NIGHTMARE, however, and you have no say about which wing/room you stay in. In my four stays at Congress, one was in a decent room, the other three were hellish. One of the rooms I stayed in had a broken air conditioner (this was in the dead of summer, mind you) with STANDING WATER inside where the temp control knob was! I also saw tiny worms crawling on the bathroom floor of that room. Another room had a hole burned into the carpet in the shape of an iron and what looked to be arterial spray from a murder across the box spring. There are also regularly yellowish cum stains on the white bedding. Honestly, I'm surprised that I haven't contracted something or come down with a case of crabs after sleeping in their disgusting beds. Staff is rude, you have to cross a picket line to get in the door (the strike has been going on for almost five years, now, too--with no end in sight), the in-house restaurant is a TOTAL joke (they misspelled ""toasted bagel"" on their menu--it read ""tasted bagel"" instead...maybe it wasn't a misspelling...I wouldn't put pre-tasting the food past their crack kitchen staff) and they also offer an option to pay extra for a ""room with a view"". DON'T DO IT! The time I did that was when they stuck me in a reeking, disgusting room in the Buckingham Wing that had duct tape on the walls, a door that adjoined to someone elses' room through which you could hear talking and other noises, and burn marks on the carpeting. Nice location, but they need to sell this place to someone who cares and renovate the ENTIRE hotel. I've stayed in Super 8's that were much nicer. Adding insult to injury--IT'S TOTALLY EXPENSIVE!

The hotel is being picketed by union workers and has been for the past 8 years. While the hotel is historic, it's run down. My room was neat & clean, but the carpet was ratty, featured old paint and the bathroom painfully tiny. My room faced Grant Park and I heard all the traffic on Michigan Avenue. There was a protest happening across the street which made it tough to nap Saturday afternoon. Saturday night, The Congress Plaza Hotel hosted a local prom and as you can imagine, the place was humming with giggling teenagers. Lastly, I paid with a debit card. They overcharged my debit card to cover any incidentals, which there weren't. They rang up an additional $110 which wasn't credited back to my card for 72 hours.

Check-in went all right, although I'm still pretty sure that the check-in woman at the front desk never looked up from typing, she was short and rude while assigning me a room key - not the way you want your guests to see a first impression.     After getting to our room, we discovered that even though it's an old hotel, they had upgraded their TV's, to probably 26 inch flat screens, a nice touch. Only then to discover that THERE IS NO HEAT IN THE ROOM. After realizing I could not control the temperature in the room, I phoned the front desk and ask about the heat and I was rudely informed ""there's no heat in the entire building."" This is Chicago, and even in October it's cold, I can't imagine anyone staying in this hotel in the Winter - you will spend all your time under the covers or in the shower.     That brings me to the shower. The shower head was detached from the wall, hanging 2-3 inches off the wall (as in broken, not by design). The water pressure was more like a leaky pipe. Also it took forever to get the water warm (like 5 minutes) and I mean warm, not hot, it was never hot.     I tried to get a late check out as we wanted to walk around the city for a while before our flight out later in the day and they would not accommodate that, a fairly common request among hotel guests. We had to check out by the time given, and were told we could leave our luggage with the bell hop for free while we toured the city.     After checking out at the front desk, I was directed to the bell hop station to check my luggage. After waiting in line for 25 minutes I set my bags down to be checked - the bell hop asked if one of my bags was a computer to which I said ""yes."" He then rudely told me I could not store my computer there, that I would have to go to the front desk and have it checked by security. I asked him why no one at the front desk had bothered to tell me this when I checked out and asked where to check my things, and he responded ""that's not my job!"" I explained to him that I was aware of that, but a friendly suggestion to let the front desk people know that would go far with the guests. He literally got in my face, told me he didn't like my attitude and refused to check my bag. Mind you, I was upset, but I was not yelling, nor was I raising my voice or being out of line.     I then walked to the front desk, explained the situation to the 6 girls chatting behind the front desk and they stared at me like I was from outer-space. The one girl who handled my check out said ""well how was I supposed to know you had a computer?"" I responded with ""why don't you just tack on to everyone you tell about the baggage check, ""also, if you have a computer with you, we need to store it in a separate room with Security."" I am not joking, it's like I was trying to teach them complex math equations, they stared at me blankly like they didn't understand customer service. Security finally came and stored my bags for me. Mind you, I don't have a problem with storing laptops separately, in fact I think it's a great idea considering their baggage check is right next to the front door which is easily accessible to thieves. I just had a problem with no one taking any responsibility and not one hotel employee showing any care for customer service.     I apologize for this being so long winded, but I felt this was a story that needed to be told. I'm 32 years old, I'm not some old man who just complains about everything. I stay in dozens of hotels all year long, and this by far was the worst experience I've had in probably 10 years.

Cool high ceilings and an awesome lobby and bar area except for the employee's. The front desk would not help me when concierge was not around for directions and concierge was doubled as a parking lot attendant/bell hop who had to be called in to work concierge when he was busy working the other stations. The bartender is a grump and will NOT help anyone unless you literally wave your hands and yell for him. Then if it is 10min before closing (10pm on a weekend) he won't serve you because he is too busy closing. Just to even walk through the bar he will not greet you or smile. No WI-FI.

Summary: *  Bed.  Felt like a thin mattress sitting on a wooden board, and angled with feet higher than head; *  Noise.  Room was very poorly insulated from noise.  On the last night, we heard our neighbors arrive after midnight, argue - though only speaking loudly and not screaming - for several hours.  We could make out phrases and words fairly clearly  Additionally, the previous neighbor, we could hear clear words when spoke on the phone; *  Housekeeping cleaning neighbors at 7.30 am.  Given poor noise insulation, this woke me up on Sunday morning.  Not appropriate to be cleaning rooms at 7.30 am, unless some kind of emergency; *  Storage shortage.  No dresser, only few drawers in nightstand.  Heard fellow conference goers complain of the same experience in their rooms, respectively.  Bathroom had a tiny, glass shelf above the toilet and about 4-6"" of flat space next to the sink basin.  Towel bar - only one in the entire bathroom, and two, small, rob hooks; *  Parking.  $52/day!  Really?  Yes, I've paid that amount in Manhattan.  But, it seems steep for Chicago.  Even on Wacker; *  Taxi cab shortage.  On a rainy, Friday night, the cab line took about 30 min.  It was reportedly this way for much of the afternoon / evening.  Really?  If this is the City's largest hotel (as they told us when we checked in), and it positions itself as a premium property, shouldn't it make sense that they'd have relationships with taxi companies to try and get better supply on occasions such as that?  If it's rainy, and a Friday night, there will be city-wide shortage - so, what's the contingency plan for your hotel patrons?; *  Gym.  Finding the gym was a work out.  In the basement and down a fairly long hall, and past grandma's house did I go.  Not central to the room areas;  and *  Lighting in large meeting space.  Much of the conference was in a large meeting room in the West Tower.  The lighting in there was not so great, and difficult to see the people speaking from the raised platform/stage.  Needs better spotlighting. I will say that all of the staff that I met were very nice, and willing to help.";2;1;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

So I showed up a few hours later than my friends and went to find the room on my own.  Be sure to ask which side your friends are on (West or East) as there are two separate buildings across the street from each other.  Naturally my friends were in the other tower so I had to truck it across the street.  But no worries, it is fairly easy to navigate. Rooms: sensor locks, HDTV, coffee maker, decent sized bathroom, blow dryer, etc.  Beds were comfy and I love the pillows.  The room had pretty thin walls - we could hear the neighbor's conversation and TV show through the bathroom walls, and people walking down the hall could be heard very well.  Just bring earplugs which, to me, is mandatory to get sleep in any hotel anyway.  If you stay up high enough you will have really good views of the city.  Oh and they have the blackout curtains like the ones you get in Vegas hotel rooms.  This is the BEST.  All places should have these. Hotel itself had a bar, a huge spacious lobby, a little market with Starbucks, ATM, gift shop, etc.  Cabs were easy to get and there wasn't really a line.  You can walk to the Pier and to the Magnificent Mile.  Nothing wrong with that.

We arrived early on Saturday morning since we were attending the Cubs game.  We knew the rooms wouldn't be available, but checked in and left our luggage at the bell desk.  We received a call an hour or so later informing us the rooms were ready.  We stayed in the West Tower and had a beautiful room with a great view of Lake Michigan. The hotel is always crowded, but it's always been quick and friendly service.  The bar is great with good drinks and food. We were checking out on Sunday morning, but wanted to take advantage of the beautiful day and bum around the city.  We were told we could leave the car in valet parking until 6:00 which was great - most places will typically charge for another day if you keep the car past the check out time.  The bell desk was very accommodating and even suggested we head down to the lower level and the parking attendants would bring the car around so we could preload and then park it until we were ready to leave so we could avoid the lines picking up our bags later.

Seriously!  If you like to feel like you are entering a posh hotel from the moment you drive up, this probably isn't the right hotel.  Otherwise, the room was updated and comfortably appointed, no complaints there at all.    We were placed close to the elevator, so I was concerned about noise.  We didn't hear a peep!  Impressive.  We LOVED this location - right on the river, JUST off Michigan Ave. (which I view as a positive, cutting down on street and pedestrian traffic outside of the hotel), it was perfectly positioned to walk the river, the magnificent mile, and Millenium Park.  Will return!!";4;2;1;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

It's not right in the middle of everything, but it's just a couple blocks up from Michican Ave. right along the Chicago River. We had a partial view of the river from our room, which was pretty cool. The bathroom was probably my favorite part of this room. I really liked the backlit mirror for some reason. I know it was cold outside, but the water did take a very long time to heat up (both the sink and the shower). The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, though there was a small towel on the floor in front of the bathroom when we first arrived and one of the pieces of art on the wall looked like it had some grease/fingerprints on it. Not a big deal, but attention to detail could have been a bit better. The walls weren't particularly soundproof either - there was a baby that was screaming for a good hour or so in the room next door to us, and it was pretty audible. Luckily it wasn't until around 9am and we were already awake anyway. Although we did get a great price on the room, there's two primary reasons I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of four: $9.95 per day for internet, and $52.00 per day for parking. I know it's the middle of the city, but come on now. Also, the business center is only open until 5pm every day so you're basically forced to pay for the internet if you need to print something.

As I mentioned before, a trip to the Big Bar where you can pick up an oversized drink, is definitely in order. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby which is more than convenient. The room service is prompt and comes along with a great menu... this morning I had the ""green and white eggs"" which comes with kale, avocado, and sprouts... they have certain things designated healthier than others which I'm always a fan of. The Hyatt also has a late night menu that runs I believe until 6am, for those of you who party your pants off in Chicago. I love the energy of the Hyatt Regency, and when I told the guy at the front desk I was from St. Louis and our Cards just took game 6, he upgraded me to a king size room with a gorgeous view. Highly recommended for a downtown Chicago hotel!";5;7;4;4;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

While the room was clean and modern, there is an issue with the really thin walls.  I could hear everything in the room adjacent to mine.  A man and woman were having a conversation and if I really wanted, I'm sure I could listen in and understand the words that they were saying.  But I was headed out and had no real interest.  Luckily at night it was quiet, but if you had some rowdy neighbors could totally see how this would affect the rating of this place.   I'm not sure that I'd voluntarily stay here again, but I wouldn't nix the idea either.  There are better hotels in the area, but my experience here was fairly positive for one night.";4;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
8/7/2011;YzAO8I0uiUaxwi;5MCBLBxr10NLUKZ4AboAMg;"A very solid 4-star stay! Obviously, I have not stayed at too many hotels in Chicago. As a former resident, I never had much need. But on a recent trip, it became a necessity so I set out to find the best priced hotel room downtown. A hotwire search for ""4 stars and above"" near ""downtown"" landed me a $111/night rate at the Hyatt Regency. For Thursday-Sunday! $111/night!? Chicago in the summer!? I feared that this would be a dump due to the price, but was relieved somewhat when I saw their announcement on Yelp detailing their complete renovation of all 2,000+ rooms. Wow, big hotel. Yes, indeed. This is a ""convention"" hotel, with multiple towers, huge convention spaces below and all around. It's massive. As luck would have it, the SoniCare toothbrush convention was here during my stay, so there were a lot of out-of-towners with brilliant smiles bounding around everywhere. Could be worse, right!? When you enter the lobby it actually looks more like an airport or a huge mall. Nonetheless, my check-in was quite smooth and I was on my way up to my room on the 23rd floor. What i found was quite impressive! A small room (1 Queen bed), but very modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV. Very updated and you can definitely tell the remodel went full force. Things felt crisp and clean, the carpet fresh. It was just a really nice room. And on the 23rd floor...though I didn't have a river view (could've upgraded for $20, but wasn't spending a whole lot of time there!) was looking out over office buildings and Chicagoans bustling around to work and play. Suggestion, if you're here on a weekend and there is a big convention (usually), just ask to be put on those floors. Typically people from Sonicare are not going to be rowdy and loud. 18 years olds on vacation, another story. My room was quiet and peaceful at all times.   The service during my stay was also right on key. Never had an issue. I'd never eat or drink at the lounges/Stetson's with all the wonderful options nearby and in Chicago, but they had a nice snack/bev area for quick snacks. It's not cheap or anything, but it does in a pinch. Parking: You can valet (which is probably a lot) or you can park in one of the underground lots and walk a few blocks to save about half. I think we paid around $20/night. Much better and you don't have to wait in a crazy valet line in the morning! Any complaints? Just one small one. The elevators get super jammed up around the 10-11am hour, and I waited 20 minutes for one to get downtstairs on Saturday morning because all the Sonicare ladies were going somewhere at the same time. Like all 4,000 of them. So, that didn't work so hot, but everything else considered...this was indeed a ""4 star hotel, downtown"" and for $111/night! *Also, free wi-fi. I'd stay again. If I need a hotel in Chicago, that is.";4;13;9;4;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The hotel has been remodeled and are still planning to remodel other parts of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to check in. We asked if we could have a city view and were granted it with no extra charge. Our room felt modern and updated. The bathroom was really cool and I loved the lighting. I'm a nurse so I know all the nasty germs lurking around hotels. I am really creeped out when I see other people's hair in the shower or around the toilet. I never once saw someone else's hair! The cleaning staff is great. They cleaned our room, made the bed, replaced our towels and straighted up each day! Nothing ever went missing from our room either. Plus, at alot of hotels the cleaning staff is loud and will barge in even if you have a privacy sign on the door. Nope, not here at the Hyatt. We never heard them cleaning other rooms and they never disturbed us when we had the sign on the door. Kudos! As for location...it was perfect for us! We took the train alot to other parts of the city like out to White Sox Stadium, China town and other parts of the city. Just a few blocks away, you can catch the Red line for $2.25 a ride. Thats much cheaper than a cab! Michigan ave is right up the block too. If you are needing snacks/drinks for your stay there is a grocery store 1 block away. Go out of the side door by the computers and the bistro. Go out those doors, take a left after you walk down the stairs and the store is right down the way. We stocked up on water and crackers to avoid the high prices at the hotel. We would certainly recommend staying at the Hyatt in Chicago!";4;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I also like that it's very self sustaining with several restaurants, bars, etc. all in the hotel.. not just one selection but several good choices.

Since we don't have one at home that was a real treat! The location is fabulous for so much within walking distance, and if you get really tired, which we did the last day, taxi's are inexpensive to get back to the Hotel. The only complaint was the water pressure which wasn't good in our room in the sink or the shower, but since this is our biggest complaint no worries.

The location right on the Riverwalk is great, and it's an easy walk to many of the downtown area restaurants and shopping. It is about a mile to the Navy Pier on foot, which is a lovely walk if the weather is cooperating. The hotel itself is insanely huge with a labyrinth of conference rooms, spanning two buildings and a network of stairs and underground tunnels. The outside is kind of ugly, and looks like an industrial building out of the late 70s/early 80s, but at least the rooms themselves were really nicely decorated and comfortable. The bathrooms, too, were generously sized with great lighting. The extras were also good quality--yes, I am very picky about the soaps and shampoos that are in the room. Not only that, but they also supplied a travel sized toothpaste. A nice touch for travelers who may have forgotten one of the essentials. There is a coffee counter with snacks (serving Starbucks) in the lobby which was nice to have. Regular hotel coffee does not cut it in my opinion. ;)";4;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Not knowing what to expect, we rolled in around 8:00 AM the day of our checkin, not expecting to be able to check in yet. The front desk clerk was very friendly and offered us a Queen room available then, or we could wait for a King room and they would call us when our room was ready. We decided to wait for a King and went downstairs for breakfast. Also, I have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they were able to keep it behind the front desk (I assume in a staff fridge) with no issues. Yay! This allowed us to be a little more free in our plans. Bonus, our room ready right as we were finishing breakfast! We also signed up for the ""Gold Passport"" which gave us free internet access and a late checkout (Tiphani at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly in letting us know about these perks!). Even when a snafu with the rental car company was going to make us even later than the already late checkout, they accommodated us with no hassle. The beds were heavenly, the complimentary toiletries were awesome (and that's saying something! They smelled fantastic!), and our view was exceptional (clear view of the fireworks from the Navy Pier, Room 1523).

It's close to the usual assortment of tourist mandated visits but it's also a great location for just getting outside and taking a walk through Downtown Chicago. The Staff is extremely friendly and they really do go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  I mean even the maids greet you in the hallway when they see you.   Meal choices are fair, but expect to pay top dollar to eat, or drink, in the hotel.  It's Chicago, get out and eat somewhere else.  The parking is extremely over-priced at $50 a night.  We opted to rent a car from Enterprise (within walking distance) and turned it in every night for less than $32 a day for a compact car. The gym is placed in an odd location and it looks like it was just put there because the space is probably un-usable for anything else.  Nonetheless, a good assortment of ellipticals and treadmills, all with tv's built in.  There were also some weight machines and free weights, butfloor space is limited and more than 2 people and you've got a problem. WiFi is not complimentary and I believe it's like $10 a day.  I found that rather cheesy, but I paid it anyway out of necessity.  The rooms were nice and roomy and mine overlooked the Chicago River and Navy Pier.  The wall were however paper thin as one night our next door neighbor received a call from his wife at 2:30am and proceeded to rip into his ass about leaving when their 5 year old child has an ear infection...and she had to work late.  Never fret, after 15 minutes he calmed her down and got his mother to come over and help with ""Brandon.""  and yes, we heard all that!

I really can't complain. The staff were all exceptionally sweet and wonderful, the check-in process was painless, and we didn't have any issues. The young woman checking us in even made sure to give us a room as far from the elevators as she could, since those rooms tend to be a little loud. I liked that it had immediate access to the Pedway (though there's not a whole lot down there unless you know exactly where you're going), and was really close to both Millennium Park and the Mag Mile. Great location! We signed up for the Gold Pass (or whatever it's called) and got our internet for our entire stay free. It showed up on the bill - we were warned it likely would, as they had just switched over their internet system - and it was just taken off before we checked out. I really can't complain about our stay here. Everything was wonderful! We got our room for $70/night because we named our own price on Priceline.

Cons: - A somewhat dreary room with the color scheme, which looks contemporary in the pictures, but not so in person. - The glass window in our room was dirty with streak marks and such as if they haven't cleaned it in a while... I suppose this was an excellent deal for the location and all, but I expected a little bit more from a 4 star hotel. Maybe it was listed as 3.5stars.

First off, the view, was excellent, from the 32nd floor, peering thru the Chicago skyline and looking down at the Chicago River. The beds were also comfortable but that's where the good stuff ends. First, parking. The only on-site parking is via valet ($35 each time you park) or $50 all night valet. You can park at a nearby parking garage for around $25-$30, but for a major chain in a major city, I expected some on-site parking that didn't involve ridiculous parking fees. Next, the amenities. The reception on the TV is terrible. Some of the channels barely came in. The water pressure on the shower was weak (weaker than the usual hotel water pressure). The air conditioner/fan would still circulate air into the room even though the panel had the thing turned off. After two nights, this resulted in a very dry/sore throat. Finally, the concierge. Hit or miss with these folks. A couple of them were friendly, polite and knew what they were talking about. Then  there were those who just didn't belong behind that desk. From the guy who gave us the wrong directions back to Midway (if we followed his directions we would have ended up in Indiana) and the lady who told us parking across the street was ony $23/night (it was actually $30) and the guy who sarcastically joked that the fitness area didn't have ""cool stuff"" like a jacuzzi or sauna to a whole list of other tidbits that I've since pushed out of my mind, the conceirge service at this hotel is questionable. Also, I'm not sure if they're still there, but there's a bunch of strikers/picketters outside the hotel and from a brief conversation with fellow guests who were staying on the 16th floor, they could hear them banging their pots and blowing their horns at night.

However, since that'd be quite a short review, allow me to elaborate: i found this hotel on Hotwire for the low low price of $70 a night. I have a feeling it would have been a lot more had I not booked it before there was a playoffs game scheduled the same weekend. It was worth this price, I guess, but I still wasn't pumped about my stay. First off, the hotel is really not all that convenient for public transport. We had to hoof it to Clark and Lake to catch most all of the trains. In the Spring/Summer/Fall that would be OK, but in Winter it just meant we took a lot of cabs. Suddenly the $70 room got a lot more expensive. Second, our room was TINY! The walls were paper thin, so we could hear every frickin conversation in the room next door. And they were boring conversations. The bathroom is right off the bed, and is only separated by a sliding glass door. Sometimes when two people are sharing a room they don't want the other person to hear your bathroom noises. This was impossible in our room. I tried to turn on the sink to disguise them, but the water pressure is so low that wasn't much of a help. Still, the room was clean and had a fantastic view.

Since everything seemed to be located downtown we decided to stay at the Hyatt. What a great decision. EVERYTHING was within walking distance.

Stayed here on Sunday for just 1 night, the bed was very comfy and the view from the 30 Fl was pretty sweet. I'd agree with some comments about the check-in, not the easiest process, they seem to ignore you and then have some dude come up to you (kinda creepy) from behind and ask if everything is cool. Other than that, the stay was fine, the Big Bar downstairs is not a bad place to get some drinks at the end of the night as well.";4;4;5;3;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

(One of the buttons was broken.)  I also found that the desk chair had a broken arm.  I called the ""exceptional service"" button that is supposed to take care of any guest needs.  After waiting for about 7 minutes on hold (ugh) the woman said, ""Oh, safes are security's issue.  I'll connect you.""  So before I could tell her about the broken chair I was on hold with security.  I finally got through and told them the safe had a single broken button, but it was the important one that locks the safe!  He said he would send someone up right away.   While I was waiting I figured I'd call ""exceptional service"" and get the chair fixed too.  After another 8 minutes on hold I got the agent and she said they would have someone come up and fix it.   Nobody showed up for either issue.  I had to eventually leave, and when I got back later that night the safe was still not fixed, and neither was the chair.  There was no message and no note.  They ignored the issues.  I called again and went through the same run-around.  After 5 days at the hotel they never fixed the safe or the chair!  Sheesh! On the bright side, the Regency Club did have a nice view of the river and the lake (as did my room).  The breakfast wasn't terrible in the club (they actually had a pretty good quality lox).  I wish the bagels were fresher to match up to the lox though.  But I digress.   I did appreciate they had ample bottles of water to drag around in the heat, as well as some nice fresh fruit (the plums and peaches were particularly good).   Overall I'm not sure I will ever stay in a conference hotel again!  I will go back to my old conference strategy of finding a nice hotel nearby and enjoying the stay a bit more, while having a place to get away to as well during the craziness of the conference!";2;5;3;1;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
12/1/2007;H722eNyoqjNPsqV-MP191g;IBaDaTxp2yC_-AD2QscBOA;"I forgot to review the hotel we stayed at recently (October 2007) during our trip to Chicago for a conference. I remembered to review our horrible dining experience at one of the restaurants here (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) -- but neglected to review our stay in one of the rooms. We stayed for a few nights - check in was fine. The lady was training someone, but everything was fast and efficient. The only negative was that we reserved a king size bed, but the only room left with one was one equipped for wheelchairs. She asked if that would be OK, and in my haste, I said sure. I shouldn't have. The room was horrible. The negatives piled up. First of all, the shower. That was the worst aspect of the room. The showerhead was ""removable"", attached to a bar where it could slide up and down - to adjust height I suppose. The problem here is that it would slide down on it's own... so if I wanted to clean my lower half and not my upper half it would have been great. Or if I was three feet tall. So I was constantly readjusting the shower. Not to mention the shower never felt that clean (paint peeling and water damage... and a few bugs). Oh, and it was like a tub with no sides. Secondly, there was no counter in the bathroom - so there was nowhere to put any of your stuff. At all. I actually took a luggage rack, placed towels over the straps, and put my bathroom bag on it. Ridiculous.   Another annoying factor was the door - it was configured so when you opened it, it stayed open... for way too long. It would have been fine if there was an optional button to operate the door (for a wheelchair), but it was sort of power operated so no matter what it stayed open for at least 10 or 15 seconds after you enter. So the entire floor can essentially see in your room for that long. So you kind of stand there awkwardly and wait for the door to close before proceeding. The positive for the room was the bed. It was wonderful. One of the only hotel room beds where I wake up not aching. OK, perhaps the only one I can remember where I didn't wake up aching. So that's a big plus. I guess the location was too, but it was awfully far away from the convention center.  Lobby was meh and the food options not great (especially if you want to eat healthy), room service or anything like renting a movie was grossly expensive (even for a hotel). Probably wouldn't stay there again, but hey - bed was nice and the corporation paid - can't beat that.";3;4;1;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I think it was a janitor's closet or an excess furniture storage facility. The room had no light, no wallpaper, high, water-spotted ceilings, and the furniture was crammed any way it would fit. No good, I said. I made a quick call to get a room change and ended movin' on up to the east side- literally. I was given a new room on the 29th floor with a dazzling view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The front desk clerk who gave me my new keys, Moji, couldn't have been more pleasant.

Based on the outcome of the following story, I would choose the Hyatt as my place to stay every time I come into Chicago from now on. I was working as a volunteer at an event on the Navy Pier, sponsored by the NPO I work for. Naturally, as a ""volunteer employee"", my hotel and travel accommodations were supposed to be taken care of once I followed the proper procedures for filling out paperwork and obtaining confirmation numbers. The flight was fine, the trip from O'Hare (mostly) uneventful. But imagine my shock and surprise, when my partner and I arrived at the hotel and we were informed that THE ROOMS WEREN'T PAID FOR. NOW was the time that the event coordinator chose to tell me that we were expected to pay for the rooms in advance OURSELVES, to be reimbursed at a later date. ""Mortified"" doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, especially since I didn't have a credit card that would cover the entire expense of the stay. At that moment, I was pretty much ready to haul it out of there and find the nearest Motel 6, Econolodge or Days Inn. But it was thanks to the quick and diplomatic thinking of Jennifer, the front desk rep, that the situation was made easier. She advised me and the event coordinator about what to do (obviously, this was not the first time she'd had to deal with a problem like this.) Plus, in the meantime, she made sure we still got a room at least for the night, (with a SPECTACULAR 27th floor view of ""The Loop"".) I won't bore you with the other details, but the situation was eventually resolved and we all lived (and slept and dined) happily ever after. Not only is the atrium of the Hyatt dazzling to behold (with probably the world's most interesting designer fountains), but the quality of the customer service didn't stop with Jennifer. I think everyone there did an outstanding job, but personally, I think Jennifer deserves a raise.  And the Hyatt deserves my future business, which they will most definitely have the next time we return to Chicago.";5;2;1;1;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Just as other reviewers said, we booked with hotwire/priceline and were given this hotel. We had actually stayed here in the past for NYE and enjoyed it so we figured this would be a good experience, boy were we wrong! First of all, this place is huge, there are two different wings and it can become frustrating if you hop on the wrong elevator to get to your room (you'll end up on the opposite side of the hotel). The lobby is kind of corny but it's cute and I can guess its for tourists. The rooms are decent, nothing to run home about and definitely not 5 star material. We went to check in and were told that there was a 100 dollar authorization charge (never heard of 100, usually its 50...but whatever), we gladly paid and went to our room. We got to the room and everything was fine until I noticed we didnt have any cups/ glasses. So we called for them and they didnt come, we called back and they sent them up (30 minutes later). We went out that night, came back into the hotel and literally as SOON as we got off the hotel a male security guard began following behind us. I became alarmed because I did not see any Hyatt branding on his clothing but he was holding a walkie talkie....anyway he began to ask us if we were guests at the hotel and we told him yes. He then demanded to know what room we were staying in, I didnt tell him and continued to yell at us and follow us to our room. When he saw that we had keys, he walked away. I was highly upset and decided to place a call to the front desk to complain, the gentleman on the phone told me it was procedure for their guards to do that. I told him there was no way in hell that was procedure and demanded to talk to his boss. The boss got on the phone and immediately apologized, he said that was NOT procedure and that it should not have happened. He then offered us two breakfast and lunch vouchers and made the security guard come upstairs and apologize. overall this hotel is average...but their customer service sucks...I will NEVER stay here again...EVER!";1;2;1;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

First I was put into the newly renovated West Tower. My suite was impeccably clean with a massive comfortable king size bed, a cozy little living room area, and a bathroom with a shower to die for. They even have HD TV's in all the rooms (not just the suite) and iHome's for your iPod!! Let me tell you, when I dropped my bags on the ground and plugged my ipod in....

Complete with a hand written note welcoming me to the city!! WIN!! The guest service from check-in to concierge to check-out was incredible. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The gym was just perfect. It had everything I possibly could ask for (except a pool...). To top it off, I had just run 5 miles along Lake Michigan and ended it at the gym with some weights. I discovered their little wine cooler device with moist eucalyptus infused towels, which did wonders to cooling me down! I will say though that it was annoying not having a restroom within the gym. You had to go back to the lobby to use that. To top it all off, this hotel is so massive they have kiosks set up so you can punch in your destination and it will give you a print out map of how to get there!

The toilette is situated in such a manner that to flush it one must reach in an awkward manner. When the toilette seat is up, it rests agains the tissue paper. Odd. I turned the air down when I arrived and then went out for a few hours. When I got back it was still warm. Called down (difficult to do, see below) and Juan arrived, saying he wished the hotel would give us a disclaimer. Their air system is not the type that blows air into the room, and it's silent. So no white noise. But he said they'd bring me a fan right away. To call the operator, one dials zero as expected, but then one gets a stupid robot giving options; speak the name of the employee or department you wish to reach, or press zero for the operator. I already pressed zero! Odd. After an hour I had not received my fan. I pressed the one touch button on the phone for exceptional stay. I was put on hold for over five minutes and then was disconnected. I dialed again and was spoken to after a minute. She had not heard that I requested a fan. It's been almost another 30 minutes.

Today was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago and when the taxi pulled up to the entrance, I must say I was unimpressed....it looks very old and dated.  Once I walked through the doors however, I was so pleased!  It's very modern and updated inside.  There's a beautiful fountain in the entrance that a bistro/bar overlooks.  There's also a 2nd floor bar that overlooks this same fountain.  I make my way up the escalators to the 2nd floor check in and was greeted by Jason Dennard at the check in counter.  He was so pleasant and accomodating.  He took the time to ask where I was coming in from, how was my day, etc.  He asked my prefernce for a room, ie; king or 2 queens...I respond by saying 'king'....he looks for the room options and informs me that the only available king room is by the elevator - in which he suggested I don't take that room.  I really appreciated him telling me this, particularly after reading some of the other reviews regarding noise.   I make my way to the west tower to go to my room.  There's a west and east tower - this place is huge, but everything is well marked and easily walkable.  I decide to forgo a night on the town and order room service - the menu offers all the basics - nothing too fancy unless you choose to order from Stetson's (their in-house Steak House) but expect to pay $34 for a filet or $30 for the salmon.  Instead, I opt for the vegetarian wrap, tomato soup, and a glass of Oregon pinot gris.  Either I was really hungry, or this was the best 'room service' meal I've ever had.  It was so fresh - the wrap had asparagus, red pepper, eggplant, zuchini, and a white bean puree to hold it all together.  I honestly wasn't expecting much, and this far exceeded my expectations.   The rooms are comfortable with modern decor.  I would definitely stay here again.";4;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

We lucked out and were on the 33rd floor with a great view out the window. The room is oddly laid out, with a desk facing away from the window along the back of the bed - unconventional, but a cool way to create two spaces in a small-ish downtown hotel room. Didn't have any issues with cleanliness like some people report.

2/15/2010;gTZHpBc8ztzomENW2XQ0kQ;YrugcPqjHGVkrSXpozDowg;"I recently attended the College Art Association 98th annual conference (CAA2010) at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.  As just a hotel, this place is great.  The hotel is huge and it is conveniently located near basically everything downtown.  But, when it's filled with conference attendees, it makes navigating the lobby, getting through the revolving door, or trying to get a taxi frustrating, particularly when you're in a hurry and everyone else is just milling about. At one point a big Saturday-night crowd got stuck in the revolving doors on their way to exit the building.  It took three doormen to unstick the door.  Now, clearly, this can be chalked up to the guests' stupidity, but it seems to me that these herky-jerky, stopping-starting revolving doors can be improved on. The ballroom---the location of the CAA2010 book fair---is in an absurd and rather inaccessible location.  From my room on the 26th floor, I took the elevator down to the first floor, then a set of escalators down two more flights, then walked across a big lobby, through a corridor cramped with academics conversing, across another lobby just teeming with people, and then down another set of escalators.  I was an exhibitor at the book fair and toting my credit card terminals, supplies, conference program and other documents, as well as my handbag, camera bag, and all of my winter gear, was hugely inconvenient.  Also, three floors down, there is no cell phone service.  I have a brand-new iPhone 3GS, and could make no calls, nor access 3G or wifi down there.  As a hotel that hosts, no doubt, countless conventions each year, I find this issue preposterous. As far as the room goes, it was quite nice.  Roomy, huge TV, lots of furniture, modern décor, great view, mini bar, excellent water pressure in the shower.  At one point I dropped my book on the floor and knelt down to pick it up, only to see a whole mess of dust bunnies on the floor at the head of the bed.  Also there was a Fat Tire bottle cap---not mine, I swear---in the corner of the bathroom floor, which was not picked up until my third day in the hotel.  My room was for the most part nice and quiet; I occasionally heard folks walking by my door through the hallway, but I couldn't hear through the walls like I so often have at other hotels.  The sheets were nice and I can't sleep in sheets with low thread counts, so that's saying a lot!  The bed and huge mass of pillows felt comfortable and luxurious. The staff were friendly and made me feel super-special for being a Gold Member, which I'm pretty sure just means I signed up for their rewards program. The elevator situation wasn't any more annoying or inconvenient than it usually is at a hotel filled with conventioneers all going up and all staying on different floors, but at one point the elevator I was on alone stopped on floor 19 while en route to 26 and would not budge.  Luckily, the door opened and I was exactly on the floor (not halfway in the elevator shaft like you see in action flicks), so I was able to disembark and catch another elevator up to 26. The gym was lovely.  Spacious, with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, as well as free weights, kettlebells, weight bars, resistance bands, and stability balls.  And those Stay-Fit-at-Hyatt gym towels are better than any I've ever seen.  I have to confess, I have a bit of a collection here at home for my own personal use.  The treadmills and ellipticals have display screens where you can run on a track or in the mountains, watch TV, or listen to your iPod.  The iPod attachment charges your device as you listen.  It's pretty rad. All told, I would stay here again.  I just hope that either the Hyatt increases its connectivity in the ballroom or else the next convention I attend in Chicago is held at the Sheraton across the river, where wifi and cell phone signals are a non-issue.";3;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The hotel is in a GREAT location, about a block from Michigan Ave (major shopping) and very easy walks to subway/metro, as well as State Street, Rush St, and other sights. The rooms are immaculate, clean, and well maintained.  I never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds!  The WiFi is reasonably priced, but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance.   I am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably, my single downside with this Hyatt. Prices fluctuate a lot so check often.  I have scored rooms between $149-$199. The area is safe, walkable, and family friendly!";5;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Our room was, according to the girl at the front desk, recently renovated. I believe it, it was pretty swank and modern inside and had a nice view looking out at the river. The Bathroom was a good size. The afforementioned front desk employee was very nice. It was pricey, which is understandable given the location, but that price not does not include wi-fi. Very dissappointing. It may seem like a trifling complaint, but in this day and age wi-fi is as basic as cable tv in hotels. Also, housekeeping comes by very early, which is no big deal unless you forget to throw the ""privacy"" sign on the doorknob the night before in your drunken stupor. The location is very central and convenient to the all the train lines, but is more shoppy and businessy than anything. Not a lot of exciting bars in the area, but cabs and trains are everywhere so it doesn't really matter. Parking looked like a giant pain, the front check-in lot was always a tangle of poorly places vehicles. In short, not a bad hotel by any means but i will try someplace else next time.";3;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
12/24/2010;qAqTm0JmLlcNe6tGaKSB3A;ZeVO3Z26xm109mIxgdNczQ;"Initial caveat:  we got a 4-night stay during the holidays for $75/night using priceline's name-your-own-price, so it's hard to complain, cause the place is really pretty swanky.  But, I strongly doubt that the maid service, concierge, and other service personnel knew we were there on the cheap, so it doesn't excuse their behavior. The place was undergoing major renovations, so the outside of the buildings and the (main) east tower was kind of a mess, which maybe explained why they may have been short staffed or disgruntled.  We stayed in the West tower and it was quiet and the rooms were nice and comfortable, with good views. The service was rotten though.  The maids never once replaced anything they removed from our room.  If I ever wanted fresh glasses, ice bucket bags, or shampoo/conditioner, I had to call the maid service and request them.  And when I called, I usually got attitude: ""Can I get turn-down service tonight while we're out this evening?"" ""OK, someone will be up shortly."" ""And would you ask the maids to possibly check and replace any used or empty items around our room while they're up here?"" (gruffly) ""Ok, sir, you're going to need to tell me EXACTLY what you need.  What do you ACTUALLY need?"" I listed the various items, which I found later in a plastic bag tossed in the bathroom sink.  They couldn't even place the items in the shower or their various places. The other big issue was room service, whose absurd prices (I assumed) already contemplated the strenuous task of delivering the food up an elevator,  Nevertheless, they charged a $4 delivery charge on top of auto-gratting the bill 18%.  Thus an already over-priced $13 turkey sandwich cost a mandatory $20.  Ridiculous. I like Hyatt and would probably try the other one near the Water Tower if we visit Chicago again, but this experience was a mess.  If we'd been paying the full $179/night, I would probably have lost it.";2;1;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
7/13/2011;JPJTbgh159TjR5nrQDxPIg;vRdHx-9ernUk0d9iVJl8kA;"During our stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, we enjoyed being only a few blocks from Millenium Park, Macy's and the Art Institute. Our beautiful room (1064 in the East Tower) overlooked the Chicago River and the Magnificent Mile skyline. Automatic check-in was quick and easy. We arrived before the 3 p.m. check-in and were able to check our luggage easily. Before we settled in, my husband did his usual 10-minute bedbug search with high-beam flashlight and magnifying glass, and there is no problem here. My number one priority in hotels is getting a good night's sleep, and we slept beautifully. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the linens and pillows of high quality. The blackout curtains did their job, and there was no noise from the street or adjacent rooms (the hotel was full at least one of the nights we were there, so we did have neighbors). We visited in the summer, and the room and public areas were always delightfully cool. Transportation was excellent, with the Number 6 bus to Loop stores and Hyde Park stopping in front of the hotel, and the Number 151 Michigan Avenue bus on the corner. Valet parking was easy, and there was always a line of cabs at the hotel. The housekeeper was very nice and she kept the room spotless. The shower felt great! Hotel staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, with none of the ""have a nice day"" automatic civility of many businesses that cater to the public. After I tried and failed to get tickets for Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House tour, I turned to the concierge, and she walked me through booking the tour on the Robie House website and printing the tickets. Another concierge printed driving directions back home for us. Breakfast Buffet: The selection and presentation is terrific. It's like attending 12 bar mitzvahs!  Manuel made me a wonderful omelet, cooking the onions and mushrooms thoroughly, as I requested, before adding the spinach and cheddar cheese I had selected. The fruit cup and pineapple spears were very fresh. There are options to match any appetite and special diet, and for those without time to wait for an omelet, there were at least a dozen egg and pancake dishes on the steam table. Smoked salmon, excellent cheeses (including artisan cheddar, goat cheese and brie) and freshly made waffles were available, and there was an extensive selection of breads, pastries, cereal and drinks. Service was exceptional!  Manuel brought my omelet to the table, and the waiter brought me coffee, water and a newspaper. One of my restaurants pet peeves is constant sound. While there were televisions in the dining area, the sound is muted, leaving guests in blessed silence to enjoy this fabulous breakfast. The workout room was clean and well equipped, and you can hook up your iPod to the cardio machines. My husband and I enjoyed a drink at The Big Bar. The negatives: Constant noise from the bathroom fan, loud enough that we had to keep the bathroom door closed; a squeaky bathroom door; and intermittent motor-like noise from above the ceiling. I asked to have these problems fixed and they weren't. Also, the flat screen television did not have a very good picture, most shows were not high definition and there was no programming guide. At one point during our stay our key cards stopped working. Assistant Front Office Manager Rocco LaFronza was just delightful. He got us into our room and comped us breakfast buffet the next day, turning a negative experience into a positive.   I look forward to staying at this luxurious hotel again.";5;1;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Check-in area was a zoo.  Not enough room for the size of a hotel it is.  Not sure what's going on with the street entrance to the West Tower, but it just seemed odd.

The staff was friendly, they don't go out of the way to speak to you, but when you ask them a question they are nice/helpful. Concierge gave us good recommendations. We were out in the city pretty much all day, so we didnt ask for much at the hotel, just towels, towels, and more towels. They were quick to bring up more. The 3rd day they brought us a ton of towels so we didnt need to call for more... lol. Quick check-out, clean rooms/bathroom. CONVENIENCE is the #1 reason to choose the hotel. Walking distance to Mag Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, navy pier, Giordano's, CVS, connected to the downtown tunnel for quick meals. It was a block over from Michigan so we were close enough to get to everything yet away from the large crowds on the main strip. Cons - There was a pair of dirty socks left in the closet in plain sight, that the cleaning crew obviously missed... however the rest of the room was clean.  There are NO refrigerators in the room.

Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries.     Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. I was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel alot. It is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. Definitely would stay here again when Im passing through Chicago.";4;3;2;1;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

6/12/2009;gHnr9pZuj;FUa2UYW8T8SeXtKdDzx3Bw;"I've been to this Hyatt twice since moving to the city. The first time was last summer: I'd scored a room for my mom (she was visiting me for my b-day) for only $100 on hotwire during the first week of June. I was really looking forward to hanging out at the hotel with my mom and just absorbing the atmosphere there. Unfortunately for my mom, my dad was being an idiot that weekend, so she couldn't make it for the night. She told me I could have the room and then called them to let them know I'd be taking over the reservation. They were really nice about it and didn't give me any hassle. One of my friends was in town early to visit and so we both ended up taking the room (neener to my bf, who didn't get to come). My mom was really nice and let us order a glass of wine (each) close to midnight (which would begin my 23rd birthday). I took it as a good sign when our total came out to $23 and some change. We had a wonderful time dancing around our room celebrating my birthday. The room was really nice and we both enjoyed the iHome they provide. Did I mention the view of the river was fantastic? A wonderful start to my 23rd year of life. My second experience was last fall when my best friend chose the Hyatt to spend her bachelorette party night at. Upon my arrival I was hassled by a rude member of the concierge because I couldn't remember the bride's room number and they wouldn't give it to me because I ""wasn't on the list"" of the room guests. Not really a big deal-I know they're not supposed to give out room numbers anymore. So I stood there for a few minutes while I waited for a response text from the matron of honor. I got it, announced to her the room number and a ""thanks for nothing!"" (rude, I know, but so was she), and I was up the elevator, lickety-split. The room was the same as the one I'd shared with my friend for my b-day back in the summer-double bed with an iHome. I got there early and in order to commemorate the  occasion (bachelorette party), they actually sent us (free of charge) a bottle of champagne, 4 chocolate covered strawberries, and some chocolate covered biscuits. Score! It was so nice of them. We had a nice night there. Hung out in the cool bar after getting back from the festivities, walked around the hotel, and finally went to bed around 3am. Definitely a classy hotel. I'll stay there again sometime for sure.";4;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
10/25/2011;Ixzzqw;fpfVQvyJxlnI08jATEO2fw;"Wife and I were taking a ""bucket list"" train tour of the US and had just arrived from the West Coast on the Empire Builder. It was late, we were tired and didn't know what to expect for our $79 Priceline room. A King was not available, so we were upgraded to a suite that I am sure was nearly 1000 square ft. if not larger. The notice on the door said the room rented for $1000 (or that could be charged for it). It was on the upper floors and had a spectacular view of the Chicago River and the Wrigley Building across the river. I had a minor problem at the front desk inquiring about my ""Gold Passport"" and the manager upgraded me to Platinum status allowing us access to free breakfast and evening cocktails. I couldn't have been more pleased with the nice lady who checked us in and the hotel manager who more than resolved a minor problem with four days of free cocktails! We spend four wonderful days there before continuing our ""bucket list"" train trip. I am not easily impressed, but our treatment here was nothing short of spectacular. Everyone from the Bell captain, front desk to my infrequent visits to the bars, was exceptional. I had no idea the hotel was ""upgraded"" or ""remodeled."" It looked, to this traveler, like a brand new facility. A side note: Our room had two full couches a conference table with 6 chairs and a full business desk. I asked the front desk what the room was called for my review. She said the room wasn't ""officially"" listed, but could be requested. It had several floor to ceiling picture windows and could function as an office as well as a hotel room.";5;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The bathroom was of a good size also. Unfort I did not get a room of a view of the lake but that was ok as the room over all was nice. This is a HUGE hotel that many conventions use to host the events and the guests. It is a bit impersonal compared to the boutique hotels that I have stayed at in Chicago and else where but what it really boils down to is: are the rooms and hotel well maintained and clean and do I feel safe.

10/21/2007;3bxSnzgEm6tNGxq0ENjHJg;ugB4E6sKdm0JeLerrfpZWQ;"The Regency Hyatt...is one of my 4 favorite hotels in the city (others being Sofitel, Swissotel, and W). Basically, it offers the most luxurious rooms you will ever experience anywhere, and saying you get much more than you pay for is an understatement. Thick, soft pillow top beds, Oreck air purifiers with ionizer and fragrance inserts, ipod docking station, 5-disc cd changer, large-screen tv, fresh tulips, white callas, or some other exotic variety of long-stem flower in a crystal vase in your room daily, solid cherrywood furniture, brass desk lamps, memory foam pillows with extra pillows and blanket in the closet, 600 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets and comforter that feel like silk against the skin, and the bathrooms...aaaaahh...no expense spared on anything! The layout of the rooms represents a perfect melding of design, aesthetics, and  function.   I have ABSOLUTELY no complaints or disappointments, and that says a lot because I am one picky bastard. Expect rooms to run about $180-237 per night. Also, when you're confirming your reservation, ask for a complementary upgrade to a king on the Regency Club level floor (this is the limited access uppermost penthouse floor). If you're lucky, one will be available at no extra charge and you will be privy to one of the best views of Chicago. This is one of the few hotels that will make you feel guilty upon check-out and as you settle your bill...knowing you would have gladly paid $200-300 more a night for the kind of luxury you enjoyed during your stay.   I can go on and on about the Hyatt, but  I will stop here because the 4-star+ ratings already speak to how amazing your stay will be. RECOMMENDATION: YES...DO the Hyatt Regency EVERY CHANCE YOU GET! Special occasions, for a weekend of downtown partying, whatever excuse you can think up to get you there! Get a king room on one of the upper floors (if you can, do the Regency Club level...there is no better view of the city). Try their website's special promotions when you're booking first, but if you're only seeing $200+, then hit Priceline or Hotwire...they tend to have the best deals for all of the nicer Chicago-area hotels. I also suggest parking your car in the garage about a block away (can't think of the name of the street for sure...but just off Wacker and Columbus Dr..by the bridge). That garage is not affiliated with the Hyatt, but only charges $26 a day.  If you do Hyatt's parking/valet service, expect about $46 (after taxes) a day with in/out privilege. I know...OUCH! ...but hey...it's Chicago. Also: Lobby level floor...huge open restaurant, lower-lobby level...bar/lounge area where drinks are served in the evenings. You will also find the Hard Drive nightclub here, which is situated in the middle of a fountain/pool...so surrounded by water. Check out pics. DISCLAIMER: My experience is limited to the Regency Club penthouse level, however, I had many friends stay in regular king rooms and reported experiences similiar to my own.";5;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
11/12/2007;pyHPjmasF33b5CvL7vQkdQ;5mFtCLdzwGCnalxod1Ox9g;"I attended a conference in Chicago last year and the Hyatt was one of the conference hotels. Because of the Hyatt name, there was no decision to make; of course, I would stay at the Hyatt. When we arrived, check in was easy and the staff offered us the opportunity to upgrade our room to a Deluxe room. At only $15.00 more night, I thought the amenities definitely sounded worth it. When I initially entered my room, I was impressed by the design and concept. It had an Oriental feel to it and reminded me of some of the boutique type hotels I have stayed in the past. I noticed on the surface that the room was rather dirty. When I sat down at the desk, the leather placemat was very sticky. On the bathroom vanity, there were numerous soap type stains. I was able to easy rub them off with a damp washcloth. The walls were dirty, both in the bathroom and bedroom. Both the carpet and the bedspread on my bed had cigarette burns on them. This was rather surprising since I was in a non-smoking room. The carpet was more understandable, but I was surprised that a bedspread with two burns on it would be used. I also noticed that the ""plush bathrobes"" promised by the check-in staff was not in the room. I called to have a robe delivered and when I put it on the next morning, it had a big rip in the front of it. I had dinner out, came back to the room and put on my pajamas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not get the ""turn down service"" we were promised. It something I enjoy while traveling and makes me feel a bit pampered. I pulled back the bedspread and noticed much debris on the sheet. Initially, I tried to brush the sheet off, but on further inspection, I noticed there were at least five hairs on the sheets. It was really disgusting. I did contact housekeeping and the sheets were changed by a very nice woman named Sarah. She did have much difficulty finding sheets that were not torn. After 20 minutes, I told her I didn't care if they were torn; I just wanted them to be clean. She did replace the burnt bedspread and apologized that it was used. I also did not receive the daily newspaper. I did call and re-request the turndown service the next night; I received it on night #2, but not #3. I suppose overall I was very disappointed by the room that I received. I did call to complain several times (robe, turn down service, dirty sheets) but no one seemed too concerned about me. I don't know if I should have pursued it more while I was there, I felt like I was being too picky, but when I got home, my husband thought the room sounded terrible.";1;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2/14/2008;Dq9b7ePbuhDSToVSIr10Qw;Dhhv_dHIdA7LSvt6iYrRhw;"I actually travel a lot internationally for work so I've stayed in my fair share of hotels & can without a doubt say this is the WORST business floor accommodations I have ever stayed on.  I'm not even sure where to start... My reservations were for the Regency Club floor, two double beds because I was traveling with my dad.  My dad arrived prior to me & I had asked that they let him check in.  He was told there were no rooms with double beds & was moved to a suite with a king bed on the 21st floor & they would gladly give us a roll away bed for free.   When I got to the hotel I told them this wouldn't do I wasn't paying good money to sleep on a roll away bed or not be able to use the amenities of the Regency Club which I was paying for.  They were quick to move us to another room back on the Regency Club level.   I have stayed numerous times on the business floors at the Shangri-La in APAC so I guess I had my expectations set too high.  If anything the Hyatt should go take a class from the Shangri-la when they open in Chicago on how to run a business floor.  Anyway I expected a nice sized room with additional amenities, such as slippers, free internet access, & a nice selection of teas &/or coffee.  The only thing I can say nice about our room was the view.   Let's start in the entrance; there was a closet right when we entered the room however the lighting stunk so you couldn't really see anything in the closet & no slippers.   Next the bathroom, this has got to be the WORST hotel bathroom I have ever seen.  The toilet was like a public restroom & the bar to flush was up under the vanity. When you flushed it, it sounded like a 747 was coming through the wall.  The wall paper in the bathroom was coming off the wall & there were no extra amenities that I have gotten at other hotels on the business floor, such as nail clippers, razor, toothbrush etc.  I am paying good money to stay on this floor & didn't just upgrade when I checked in.  There was 1 bathrobe on the back of the door that I guess all of us are supposed to share.  The hairdryer was a piece of crap that if you used longer than 90 seconds on high it would overheat so to blow dry your hair you had to allow at least 30 minutes of going back & forth waiting for it to cool down.  Now lets continue on to the main bedroom.  The beds were nice & had nice down comforters on them the pillows were great & there were 4 on each bed with one in the closet.  The TV sucked the remote control would only work from one exact location in the room which of course wasn't where you were sitting in your bed.  I was floored to find out we didn't have free internet access in our rooms like many other hotels offer business floor guests.  (I did pay extra for this room right????) We stayed 4 nights at the hotel & only received turn down service two of the 4 nights.  Some days we would only get 1 coffee refill for our coffee pot & other days we would get two.  Some days we would get 1 new washcloth some days we would get three.  It was like playing a game of craps.  The only thing that seemed consistent was the morning paper.   Now let's move on to the Regency Club which offers free continental breakfast, snacks throughout the day, cocktail hour & desert hour.  Breakfast was ok the set up of the room is just terrible they toss a bucket of ice in the bar sink & toss in some yogurts & the milk & juice.  There is 1 trash can in the entire room & you get to drink your coffee from a paper cup.  I thought they would at least have a hot pot or two with oatmeal & some other hot items like MOST business floors do.  Nope... you get your choice of pastries, fresh fruit & little individual boxed cereals.  Not my idea of a great continental breakfast.  I've actually had better at a Holiday Inn.   Cocktail hour this was my favorite... at most hotel when you stay on the business floor they have complimentary cocktails & appetizers for a few hours every evening.  While the appetizers were great the beverage service stunk.  It was a serve yourself honor system $6.50 for a beer & $5.00 for some wine & oh yeah pour it yourself.  Don't have cash then please fill out a card with your room number & we will just charge your room.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I'm still at this point trying to figure out what the hell we paid extra to stay on this floor.  At this point I've vowed to stay at the Shangri-la next time I'm in Chicago (opens 2009).  Desert hour was ok it's from 8:30-9:30 & was different every night.  Cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies, clairs. I guess all I can say is if you have never stayed on a nice business floor at a really nice hotel then you will be fine staying on the Regency Club Level.  If you have stayed in some really nice hotels with really nice amenities then you are bound to be disappointed with your experience at the Hyatt.  I would highly recommend not upgrading to the Regency Club it's definitely NOT WORTH the extra money.";3;0;0;0;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I attended the NYE 2009 bash at the hotel and let me tell you, it was a bash and a half. I went with a bunch of friends and we ended up getting three rooms total and all of the rooms were incredibly nice, big flat screens, ipod docks, granite counters in the bathroom, great views, etc. The party allegedly had 2000 people attending but the Hyatt was definitely ready for everyone, checking in was a breeze, and they gave us our three rooms all on the same floor, which was a total perk. The party was a blast - the top level was the band and it had lots of light, and the second level was much more dark, clubby, and had a DJ. I would HIGHLY recommend if you attend the shindig next year to get to the party as early as you can because finding seats to eat was a struggle. Partially because we had a large group but that was pretty much the only negative for the party. You occasionally had to wait a long time for a drink but almost every bartender handed them out two at a time and they were all strong. The party was a huge success, the hotel was beautiful, and everyone had a great time. HOWEVER - upon checking out the next day and heading back to the burbs, I realized that I had left something in the room. Right around the same time, my friend called and told me she had left something in her room too. OK partially our faults because hey, check and make sure you have all your stuff. So I called and talked to the Lost and Found department and they told me they'd look for it and get back to me. They didn't get back to me. I called the next day. They said they still hadn't found it but that doesn't mean that it had not shown up. My friend stopped by the next day. They didn't have either thing. I have called about every other day for almost two weeks now and neither of our items have shown up. Their voice mail message says they will call you back in 24 hours and I've probably left four messages and gotten one call back. I just think it's insane that they have a designated lost and found department ... employees whose ENTIRE job is recovering guest's lost items... and they haven't found either item OR gotten back to us about our lost stuff. So that really negatively affects my overall Hyatt experience, sadly. I understand that NYE was really busy and a lot of people probably left stuff but I have called multiple times and they are well aware of me and what I am looking for.... how could they have not found either thing, almost two weeks later? Bogus. In short, the NYE party is a GREAT value but if you attend next year, MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE WITH WHAT YA BRUNG!!";3;2;1;1;N;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

But worst of all, the maid knew the drain was clogged. When we returned to the room, I noticed the drain was unscrewed and left in the bathtub; we had left it screwed into the bathtub. So I thought, ""Oh good, the maid unclogged the drain."" WRONG. If it wasn't for the location and excellent service right outside the hotel, I would give this hotel two stars. The front door guys are very helpful with directions. They also recognized after our second trip to the hotel, and they always hit the open door button for us. That's service.

Location was key for the both of us as it would be our first domestic vacation where we relied solely on public transit.  With that said, the PH was just around the corner from the Red line and one block away from the Blue line which can take you to O'Hare...saving you lots of money on cab fare! Stepping into the hotel was a little was odd as it was a cold, stale looking interior until we took the escalator up to the lobby where a ceiling mural of luxurious art greeted us; eat your heart out Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The lobby alone was rich in history and grandeur.  Check in was quick and friendly. There was just one elevator bank with eight cars, unless you were staying in the Executive floor and you had your own exclusive elevators to use.  Our room was located on the 8th floor, where the fitness center was located as well.  The room was of decent size and the decor although fairly newer, was kept in style of the hotel.  The bathroom was very small, but functional.  It could've used some ventilation system as it would get quite steamy during a hot shower so, we had to always prop the door open.  The room had a walk in closet and safe big enough to hold a laptop. However, our room did have a connecting door to each room on both sides of us.  One night, we could hear deafening cries from an infant in the room next to us.  I wanted to complain but I felt sorry for the parent who had to deal with it.  Then on the Friday night, we could hear music radiating  from the Ballroom (not sure how many floors below us) for a wedding or something.  But all things considered, noise wise, I would consider ourselves majorly lucky as we were placed in a room facing other rooms (Imagine a ""U"" shape, we were on one side of the ""U""), otherwise we would be hearing cars and the above ground train on Wabash. A couple other pros I should mention was the HSIA was complimentary, which is pretty rare for full service hotels, not to mention, the signal strength was excellent. The other pro was having a Starbucks on the ground floor. Overall, our stay was very pleasant and made our trip to Chicago totally enjoyable knowing we had a comfortable room and cozy bed in an amazing hotel!  Chicago was an awesome city and when we come back, we're staying at the PH again!";4;2;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Everyone here mentioned the ""wow"" factor of the lobby, which was lovely. But, the room, the view and the bathrooms were surprisingly ho-hum. Our 10th floor room overlooked a fire escape and the metal sides and roof of the pool. We couldn't see the street at all. The bathroom-aside from a posh sink-was similar to my grandma's. (No offense, grandma) Very old-school 1950's with old tile that needed a good scrubbing, old tub, very small. The indoor pool is small but it has a deep end that went to 8 feet and a hot tub, which the kids loved. We basically had it to ourselves at 5 pm, but by 9:00 in the morning it was near capacity. The only other thing we didn't like was the maid knocking on our door at 8:00 a.m. to ask if we were leaving yet. We said, ""No, check out isn't until noon so we planned to stay until then.""

5/28/2012;RxP7MH5HEevk;SyoTBw_CMhqpr1cynpLFeA;"Attn: Mr. Todd Temperly What happened to the GOOD OLD DAYS?  When Hospitality meant something... When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com";1;1;0;2;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

7/14/2012;bQRv;sEJWAGJakJ0LD8QsnSrYcw;"I wanted to enjoy this hotel so much, because I love classic architecture and the location of the hotel is amazing. You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening. No way I will be spending another trip at the Palmer House.";1;3;0;2;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

If it were just me and my husband for a weekend, I might give it 4 or even 5 stars, because -It's beautiful -The rooms are lovely and clean, albeit a bit dark -Beds are super clean and comfy -Great location -Friendly, helpful bell staff -Great room deal However, I was arranging lodging for my wedding party with 5 rooms. The very cool and detached attitude by the staff left me nervous that my older/international guests would have problems with the impersonal service or that the end of my stay would be marred by a billing problem . We booked 5 rooms for myself and my wedding party and our guests booked another 6-7 rooms. When we booked and paid for the 5 rooms, I asked if any of the rooms had  a mini-fridge (for my cake) and the front desk agent looked past me and said, ""no that's an extra $40/night""  After spending $2500, I felt a little put out.  Later, I was checking a room quote for a friend and noticed that the rate for an executive level room was just $15 more a night. I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option. The final resolution was a free upgrade for myself and the assurance that the concierge was available to handle any needs I had.   I needed to change the names on a couple rooms and each time I called the Front Desk, I was on hold for 20 minutes.  Each conversation started witht he agent telling me they couldn't change it because I booked it elsewhere, then I would insist that I confirmed and PAID at the Palmer directly, more time on hold, and then changing the name. Finally, I emailed a list of guests to the concierge a couple days before the event, in case people got lost or had a problem with their reservation. It was met with radio silence.

At check-in, I was lucky enough to be helped by an arrogant, entitled gentleman who didn't find it worthy of his time to share with me how I could find my room, where the pool was or even how to access the elevators. I couldn't even get the jerk to smile.  I didn't think much of it until I was checking out (more on that later) and heard another staff member graciously and cheerfully speak to patrons. Now, I have a lot of respect for housekeeping staff. They undoubtedly work very hard... but what I did not appreciate was 1) how late the rooms would be cleaned. I got back to my room at 4pm once and it was still in the state that I left it in 2) when I would leave my room in the mornings, how my housekeeper would ask me if I wanted my room cleaned. When I answered yes, she had to make sure I was certain of my decision and would then be disappointed. What the hell?! I get that it would be nice to have one less room to clean, but isn't that your job? 3) noisy and inconsiderate staff. Because the walls are paper thin at this hotel, I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room.... including the HUGE fuss the staff made about the room next door... at 7:30AM!!!!!!! Apparently, when my neighbors checked out of their room, they left behind quite a bit of broken glass and furniture. The staff cleaning up IN the room thought it appropriate to YELL OUT to other team members down the hall to come see the wreckage. I could distinctly hear the chatter, the furniture being moved around and even the noise coming from their walkie-talkies.... all at such an ungodly hour. Unforgivable. Plumbing was a nightmare. Not only was the flow from the shower head poor, but, if a housekeeper was cleaning next door and turned on the water there, my water pressure got even lower!!!! Did I mention that the bathroom is tiny?! Don't rock back and forth as you brush your teeth - you might just fall into the toilet! So here's my biggest gripe....an hour before check-out, I review my invoice and there's clearly an erroneous charge. I never dined in the hotel's restaurant. I try reaching the front desk SIX TIMES and no answer. I ask concierge to connect me and still no answer. Finally, 15 minutes later, I try again and get a live person on the phone. I explain that I never dined at the restaurant. No problem, he says, he'll remove the charge. Says I need to come down to pick up a new invoice.  I gather my belongings, head downstairs. A new staff member prints out my invoice and the charge is still there. I contest it and make reference to my call earlier. This dude says that there's nothing that can be done. In fact, because I didn't get the name of the person who said he'd waive it, I'm stuck. The charge needs to be ""investigated"". So hold on... I just spent over $900 staying at your hotel and you're gonna squabble with me for $17?!  Of course, I asked to speak to the manager. So Ms. Rasha comes out and says I should go home. If the charge isn't legit, she'll credit my account. I tell her that's not going to fly with me. This is my company card and each charge needs to be substantiated. I know I didn't dine at the restaurant in the hotel. IN FACT, I wasn't even at the hotel at 9:30pm last night. So she tells me, that 9:30pm must have been when the charge posted, I must have eaten there earlier and just simply forgot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? I tell her no, I haven't dined at their restaurant PERIOD. She offers to go through last night's receipts and get this, if the name on the receipt matches mine, I have to pay for the dinner. Why would I try to get out of a $17 charge if I had actually authorized it?!  She says to come back after 30 minutes. I go back after 45 minutes, and a new staff member tells me she's still looking through receipts. Fine. I go make myself useful and come back 25 minutes later.  The new staff member goes into Rasha's office, comes out, and prints me a new invoice without the charge. No explanation. No apology. Nothing.  I asked her what happened and she says ""The manager removed the charge. It was posted to the wrong room.""   Does the manager not know anything about customer service? Does she not have the human decency to come out and tell me this in person after she had me wait over an hour?  I ask her to call out Rasha and the latter comes out with an indignant look on her face. I tell her that I'm appalled by her customer service and thank her for inconveniencing me. Her reply? ""You're welcome"".";1;4;1;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Look at this location!  Look at this building!  I want to die every time I go into the lobby it is so beautiful.   Ahh, but this is how they suck you in!  And how it just masks the greatly unfortunate experience from then on. Twice I had someone new at Registration.  And both times, instead of finding out the correct information, they tell me something completely different and wrong and completely waste my time. (1st time was in trying to get approval for me to check in without husband present, whose name was on the reservation.  2nd time I asked about a mailbox, because my letter was too large to fit in the mail chute on my floor. But to be fair, when I went to someone who knew what they were doing about my check in issues, it was fixed immediately.) So check in is at 3, right?  Exhausted,  I get to the room, throw down the bags, and call room service for a pot of coffee. Room service is ""closed"" until four. But the helpful pre-recorded message assures me that the restaurant downstairs, Lockwood, would definitely be able to help me!  I call Lockwood.  The chick on the phone says ""yep, come on down and get your coffee here"".  Oh, OK thanks, but I can just go to Starbucks for that?  Why would you have any service unavailable at the same time you have people checking in?   And speaking of the room.  I was ""upgraded"" because of the mix up at check in. My upgrade was to a small room that would have been beautifully decorated in 1990, complete with a large armoire that held a tube TV.  My view was of a fire escape (and most likely the alley below but I was too high up to see that far down.) Quite a bit different than the rooms they promote on the website.   I decide to check out the fitness center.  This is on a lower level, but when the elevator doors opened you would think you were in a completely different hotel.  Beautiful, modern decor in chocolate, greens and peacock blue.  The fitness center looks like a spa from the outside.  There is a woman at a desk who asks you to sign in.  Just as my pen hovered over the paper she adds ""Oh and by the way there is a $10 charge per day to use the facilities"".  Wait...what?  Are you serious?  Gah!  No thanks.   I just feel like my entire stay was non-stop irritation.  Are hotels the new airlines where the idea of service is dead and you are nickel and dimed to death?  I guess so, at least in the Palmer House.  Such a very serious let down.";2;6;2;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

11/23/2011;dJX4W7-KSVb471VjuPkLEQ;YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ;"Random fact: the Aflac duck & the three Budweiser penguins stayed at the Palmer House. My company's annual meeting was being held in Chicago this year at the Palmer House.  Unfortunately, our staff would be split between two hotels.  I was one of the lucky ones who got to stay at the Palmer House...or so I thought... Being a Hilton hotel, I expected so much more from the Palmer House.  I looked at their beautiful rooms on the internet and upon checking in noticed that they received a plaque for being a historic hotel.  Apparently, it being a ""historic"" hotel only meant it was old and creepy. LOBBY: Absolutely beautiful! The walls and ceiling has such amazing and elegant detail.  However, note that the lobby is located on the second floor. ROOMS: My room did NOT look like the rooms on their website and felt quite cold and creepy.  I walked into an outdated room the size of a large closet or tiny bedroom with a double size bed.  Who still has double beds?!   The edge of the bed was extremely close to a door that opened to a tiny closet that had a safe, iron, and ironing board.  My coworkers and I compared the bathrooms to something you might see out of a horror movie like The Shining.  There was also a TUBE tv.  Free internet?  Nope, they charge...and there isn't wireless internet, you need to use an Ethernet cable. LOCATION: A block or so from Millennium Park (home of the bean) Close to the Blue (Monroe Street exit) and Red (Adams Street exit) train lines A block from State Street shopping area Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money for one of the hotels located across the river.  You'll probably be a lot happier.";2;1;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

(1) I called before my flight to put my wife on the reservation since I was coming in 4 hours after her. They assured me this was done even after I asked them how they would do it since they didn't ask for her name. They take the name but I am skeptical. I land in Chicago and sure enough, my wife has been wandering around in 30* weather like a hobo in California clothing. They apologize but that's about it. (2) The guy at the desk was a smart ass. He asks for my ID, I give it to him. He then asks if I go by an alias, I tell him I use my nickname (DJ R***) often (my name is D*** R*** Jr). He finally says, OK, why are you using a different name? I'm a nice guy and will accept it, but most hotels will not. Really? I've been traveling frequently for the better part of 10 years and have never had a problem. (3) I get to the room and damn near hit the bed with the door... THE ROOM IS THAT SMALL. Heel to toe (size 13 show) 4 steps to the door from the bed and 1.5 steps from the wall to the bed on the other side. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Yeh, they put a desk but it's so close to the foot of the bed that it's more intrusive than useful. There is a dresser and TV but it's tucked in a corner rendering the TV unwatchable. (3) The bathroom is tiny and using the toilet necessarily puts you into the wall. When I got here, I immediately started looking at other hotels (like the Wit where I stayed a couple months ago) but was talked down by my exhausted wife. I wanted to complain and probably will... never again Palmer House, never again.";1;2;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

For the love of God.  I'm willing to pay three hundred dollars a night for a hotel.  What I'm not willing to do is pay two hundred a night, then be nickled and dimed for the third hundred.  As I check in, I'm informed that the valet service will cost 60 dollars a day.  It's not uncommon to pay for valet service, but 60 dollars seems a bit steep, and it'd have been nice to choke on that figure before I surrendered the car.  Use of the internet costs 15 bucks per day -- unless you want a porn-streamable connection, and then it's 20.  Use of the gym 10 bucks per day.  There is a cheap plastic cork screw sitting on my desk, and I will not be surprised one goddamn bit if a nominal rental fee for its use magically appears on my bill tomorrow morning.

Last Christmas, my friends and I let ourselves get upsold to the Executive Floor for a weekend and it was just what we needed. I gorged myself on the breakfast, snacks, and nighttime hors'doeurves right down the hallway from our extra-large suite. Excellent. Also, bathrooms are much nicer on the Executive Floor, with dual showerheads and ambient lighting. The age of the hotel is really starting to show though, and they haven't gotten around to updating all the rooms, so it's a total crapshoot as to whether or not you get a good one. And after having stayed in both styles of rooms, the older one definitely feels...well, old, almost grandmotherly. Internet is also ridiculously expensive when free WiFi is becoming the standard. If you want a historic, gorgeous hotel, and really don't mind getting nickled and dimed here and there, this is the place for you.

Sadly, the current management of the hotel leans totally on it's great historic beauty; it in fact exploits it. What should by all rights be a ""luxury hotel"" (which one expects when reading about it's historic beauty), fails miserably; the experience can be characterized by mediocre service and a noticeable lack of amenities; it is a wasted treasure, misunderstood and poorly managed by it's current overseers. On a specific note, we were very irritated by the terribly inconvenient internet situation, they had NO wireless and charged $14.95/day for a direct cable connection at a desk in your room - this means you are chained to the desk for all internet activities. This was a real inconvenience. (but do see my photo of my handsome husband, Jon, chained to the desk by a short DSL cable!). Having said all this, the location (in the heart of downtown) is great - very convenient to public transit and taxis, centrally located with easy access to museums and many interesting neighborhoods and with several excellent restaurants nearby. And honestly, the huge, spectacular, historic lobby, in all it's splendor, makes it all worth it. The rooms are clean and acceptably appointed, if not inspired.

I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review.

Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the ""check-out situation""... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room.

The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed.

More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago.

Despite the fact that the main lobby was closed due to the fact that they were completely stripping it and renovating it, I still had an amazing, two-night stay there with my father, my cousins and their 2 dogs. Yep, dogs. They are pet friendly there... The rooms are gorgeous and the beds extremely comfortable. The carpet is dark in the bedrooms which is awesome because it absorbs the light although the marble floors in the bathrooms are really, really cold. The hallways air conditioned to perfection and the elevators are numerous... I counted 11 when I was there two weeks ago. Absolutely nuts, but in a good way. The concierge staff is friendly and the bar is well stocked. Speaking of the bar, the sitting area and the entire bar room is breathtakingly beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous! I cannot wait to return to Chicago and hopefully stay there in the future. This is one of America's fine hotels. And it shows.";5;4;3;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
5/21/2009;gvhexqhA38nvR8TXSvQd1w;H9s7_whywv9yczmJD1TCQw;"Having worked at the Ritz Carlton during my younger days, I'm somewhat of a hotel snob. When you're used to providing exemplary service, you kind of expect it when you stay in a hotel right? I don't mean to be a snob but this is one industry where customer service is everything. You're leaving your home to sleep and eat somewhere else. You should feel like you're staying in a second home. My family and I took a family vacation to Chicago to bury my Grandma's ashes and do some sightseeing while we were there. My Mom booked this hotel from Priceline so I was skerred all the way there. I'd never seen the PH so I was skeptical at best. They were doing some work on the front of the hotel and it was a mess but they were very careful not to inconvenience the guests which was much appreciated. Nothing is worse than fearing for your life by entering a door. (It came out beautiful by the way). When we arrived, we were given a key to my Mom & sisters room and another key to mine and my brother's room. My room was SO small and on a different floor than my Mom's room so I asked if they could move us. Good thing! We got a room that was twice as big and had a better view. You could have put another 4 beds in that room and it wasn't considered a suite. Sweet for us! The lobby is amazing and gives you that feeling of old-world Chicago. It was like getting in a time machine but not in a bad way. Everything was well maintained and all the employees made us feel like they were honored we were there. We even got a nice note from the front desk worker a few hours after we checked in. The hotel bar is a little pricey and stuffy so we opted for the dive bar next door with all the pictures on the wall. Help me out with the name here people, I loved that place. It was literally next door from the entrance that faces the El. I was worried about the location of this place but we managed to walk everywhere we needed to go. It was really nice having Corner Bakery on the corner too, they have great breakfasts. Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel because we were usually in a hurry to go on an adventure. I guess the only reason why I can't give them 5*s is because I'm still and always be a hotel snob. You're going to have to ramp it up to mimic the Four Seasons or Ritz for me to max it out. I did love this place though, I'd recommend it for people staying in Chicago & not wanting to spend a billion dollars on a place to stay.";4;3;3;2;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
8/16/2008;0AobeQFCa8CpDL3tIaFwzA;omJUEayO0J0UfNEpW3QnTw;"Busy, busy, busy.  I think I counted seven large events going on at the Palmer House during the two nights we were there.  Think a medley of professional salsa dancers, junior high cheer squads, and large wedding parties.  I found that most of this activity was contained on the first few floors and didn't really translate to much traffic in our hallway. I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door. Bottom line: if you get a good price, go for it.";4;3;3;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I was absolutely in love with it! Drinks: *Berthas mulled wine (red wine, orange and lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, cloves, vanilla bean, brown sugar, honey): I absolutely loveeeeeeeddddddd this drink. It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go. My boyfriend drank like half of it because he also liked it so much. *Winter dream (absolut vanilla, st german, baileys, whipped cream, cinnamon): this drink was also good if you are a Baileys lover. I wish I had more of a Baileys hint to it though. It is sometimes hard to find seats here and my only complaint would be that I hate it when kids are taking up half the seats. For goodness sakes, it's a bar area and they don't drink, why the hell are they there?

Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down.

Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.";4;3;1;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2/2/2010;odVRab;UyjOsdvAPTqwUvy581k8Tw;"We were sixteen and both in town for a youth conference. We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn. There you'll find large, bright trees, a beer garden, and dozens of stalls peddling all sorts of Austrian, German, and Bavarian goods, gifts, and foods. I bring everyone I show around Chicago to the Palmer House, and it never disappoints. There's always oooohing, ahhhing, and wows. The majesty of the reception/foyer/seating/lobby area is well... simply timeless and breathless. This is an American icon without a doubt. Tip: steal your girl/guy away into a stairwell for me.

1/1/2010;qA5zPPxPBUPZWeBryfMHPA;pSU6_HEPTlOqZOrENQpErg;"Since it was New Year's Eve, I will need to start out this review by saying that I didn't really pay attention to specific details of my experience at the hotel. I do know a few things though. Enter the Palmer House Hilton: location is decent. If I were a guest staying downtown and wanted to experience the city, I probably wouldn't choose this location unless you want to be closer to Millenium Park. Walking into the hotel, it's gorgeous. It's massive size reminds me of hotels in Vegas that go on for miles. In fact, I believe that the lobby with all of the bars, etc. also reminds me of a Vegas hotel (without the casino of course). I wanted to get there early to have a cocktail prior to leaving for my party, but ended up falling behind. Never EVER wait until after 5 to check into the hotel on NYE. The line was nuts. Lucky guests waited in line while others in their party got them drinks from the bar. I knew I should have brought another person with me. Oh well. On the website, I was notified if you are staying on the Executive Level, there is a quick credit card check-in option to avoid long lines. This was not the case when I got there and the lady at the front desk never heard of that. Interesting. Perhaps something for them to look into during crowded periods? Though, for my long wait, the front desk lady gave me late check out at 2pm for free. I chose executive level because 1) it sounded cool 2) I figured it would be quieter with more business people (or just less children). Little did I know it also comes with breakfast and appetizers from 5-7 on a special floor. Fun stuff. The room was NICE. It was large and came with a couch, tv, desk, nice bed, and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy. Or it felt that way after my NYE partying. And it's not squeaky and has plenty of pillows. I just hope they wash their sheets. Vending machines. All I wanted in the morning was a bottled water, but did not have enough 1s. So I thought since it was $2.50, I could buy two and use a $5. Well, I found out it only takes 1s. Not cool. I don't like to use the glasses in the rooms due to shows about how they are never washed. I was forced to use one. :( I didn't end up using my late checkout since I got about 3 hours of sleep (it was New Years!) . I checked out on my phone to avoid lines and grabbed some ""breakfast"" in the lounge upstairs right before it closed. It was pretty much picked through, but I got a sesame bagel and chive and onion cream cheese. Definitely needed something in my stomach. All in all, I really enjoyed staying on the Executive Level. I did feel cool. We had separate elevators where you have to insert your key to get in. And the elevator was right by the front desk. I'm not sure where the other elevators were located, but that was pretty convenient. The hotel definitely served its purpose and I would stay here again if I'm in the area.";4;1;1;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while.  As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine.  Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in.  When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions.  We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party   So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom.  Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect.  We needed a place to sleep and get dressed.  We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options.  The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.   We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning.  The food was good, but it was way overpriced.  Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy.  Overall we had a great experience.  The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.";4;1;0;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Just a couple of negatives: cell phone service was very spotty in the hotel. In fact, I had no service at all when I was in the lobby.  F&B service in the lobby wasn't great.  We sat in one of the comfy chairs along the wall, hoping to have one last drink before we flew out that evening.  There was a menu on our table so clearly they do service all the tables.

The first night, the reception was also in a beautiful room with a short staircase entrance just off one end of the lobby.  The 2nd night (yes, there were 2 nights of festivities, which were fun), there was another dinner reception in another room, & apparently, there was another wedding reception going on then in the room next door.  Was kind of tempting to go crash the other one out of curiosity.   Our room was quite big...we even had 2 bathrooms and 2 closets.  It must've originally been 2 rooms they converted into 1.  Great decor.   Only minus I noticed was that the hallway we had to walk down to get to the elevator from our room had an area where the wallpaper was peeling off.  I guess none of the managerial types had walked down this way while we were there that weekend because it remained that way the whole time we were there. There's an multiple hotel serving shuttle to & from Midway (that's where I ended up flying in & out of).  Pretty convenient.  Luckily, I didn't run into any problems when I was leaving, as the Chicago Marathon was that day, but I think it was pretty much over by the time I had to go to the airport.";4;0;1;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

(As a history major, I like old-fashioned things. Thus, the Palmer House Hilton gets an A in my book.) I was there recently for a sorority formal. The event space (Empire Room) did not seem to be outdated/falling apart at all, and the room was very charming. The lighting was soft and the gold/black ornamentation was beautiful. If you have severe allergies, I'm not sure this is a place that will listen 100%, and this is an important caveat. One of my good friends is severely allergic to dairy. She called weeks in advance and was assured that there were no problems with her request. But what happened? She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend. He walked in a bit more, and then finally left. The manager said ""Oh, I would've escorted him out anyway"" or something, but I think they could've been a bit more proactive. There are serious concerns for allergies and security, but overall, the Palmer House space is lovely. They should work out a few kinks, though!";4;1;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

King sized bed, crib was in room as requested, no feather pillows as requested, got to use the short check-in line as an Honors member...room was clean and the daily maid did a wonderful job upholding that standard!! All in all a good experience in a great location 2 blocks walking from the lakeshore. Details: Pool- indoors, good...super small for such a huge hotel,add in a few unruly teens and some crappy parents and you have an unusable pool for a baby=bad  Good thing they have GREAT BEACHES in Chicago! Dennis was always at the door, helping to  get us cabs and assistance getting our bags upstairs. I think his title should be  Chicago Ambassador, as he recommended the absolute best beach for us to go to with a young child and seemed to be able to make conversation with pretty much anyone.  Good asset to the hotel. The Bathroom- normally I give Hiltons 5 stars but they fell down on the bathroom. Granite and tile with the oversized bowl sink...stylish but MAN WAS THAT SPACE CRAMPED. There was no countertop, so nowhere to put our deoderant, makeup, etc except on the back of le toilette, which isn't very sanitary, no? This did not feel like a $200/night bathroom Starbucks inside, nice to have so convenient although servers were a little curt and super slow for coffee shop workers (maybe they are immune to caffeine at this point) Ambiance- the lobby and hotel itself is truly big-city magnificent - there was a wedding there while we were there and I can understand why - the work on the ceiling was done by a guy who worked on the Sistene Chapel and there are works of art all around. - If we had just come here for drinks and dinner I would have given this place 5 stars easily for environment alone. Elegant. History- they have the pictures of all of the performers around the hotel, great names that everyone recognizes who came to perform back in the day- the peacock door has a placard next to it explaining the history...just cool to be in a place that's been around so long, it was around when they hosted the World Fair- that's OOOLLLLDD,. Room service- GREAT caesar salad but a salad, club sammie and mac n cheese bites plus two drinks cost $91 - really? Yikes, next time Imma take my lazy pants downstairs and next door Internet Access- I brought my laptop but they tried to charge me $7.50/hour or $15/24 hrs for internet access -There was NO WIRELESS and that's WAY too much to charge me for a basic service- I need internet to check flights, do some work, stream my kid's Dora movies....Even the Best Western gives it for free, what's up Hilton? Don't be cheap with me, I'm not cheap with you or your employees.

It has a gorgeous lobby (as is depicted in the photos on the website and the reviews here), and an art deco charm when you first walk in. It is clearly a hub of events from weddings to meetings with the corporate meeting rooms and the 1000+ rooms to accommodate everyone. However, in the realm of hotels I have experienced as a pleasure and business traveler, I have to admit Palmer House gets an ""eh"" when it comes to the room. My room was a double (to be shared with my sister and mom) while we were attending my cousin's wedding this past weekend. The room itself was spacious and had 2 full (but super super small with no ventilation) bathrooms which were awesome and a blessing in disguise when you have 3 women getting ready in the mornings. But that's pretty much it. The TV was super old school, and sits on one of those old hutches  that are awkward to get around and was about 24 inches max. No coffee maker or mini fridge, thereby forcing you to go to their restaurant  for coffee or waters (although there is an in house Starbucks on the lowest level which is only open until about 8 I think). The restaurant and bar also close super early so we were forced to look elsewhere at 12 am on a Saturday night for late night food and drinks. It is not a hotel I would return to to relax in tranquility as I could hear my neighbors above and next door talk loudly at ALL hours. I give it 1 star for the area in which is sits--super close to State street which has shopping which came in handy on a sweltering 90 degree day, as well as being close to Millennium Park and some good food. A couple of train lines and taxis abound. 3 stars for the AMAZING security team who helped my mom get around by bringing the wheelchair in a timely fashion multiple times a day when requested. Seriously, I don't know how I would have done it without them! Its a big hotel and really hard to get around if you are disabled and need help. Minus 1 star for the quality of the room overall and the lack of some amenities I would expect from a metropolitan hotel. I think if you are looking for a place to crash in while enjoying everything the city of Chicago has to offer, the Palmer will suffice.

The ambiance is one of elegance and the presentation was amazing. I was very excited to complete the check-in process and make my way to my room. I knew that there was something strange upon check in - the representative said something about me being in a suite and how that was too large for one person. He then proceeded to downgrade my reservation to a standard room despite my assertion that I did not want to make that change. Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small. Although the hotel had recently been renovated, the impression I got was that not much thought had been put into the design/layout of these rooms. The bathroom was terribly small. The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel. If you're only requirement is an impressive lobby, this is the place. If you are looking for comfort and service, I'd recommend you book elsewhere.";2;0;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The food has been very, very good.  The service even better (people say hello to you when it would even be reasonable for them not to - but they stop and greet you anyway.  AND it's not even like some canned comment that they clearly ""have to"" say to guests.).  Best chocolate chip cookies in the world. Love the trivia in the elevator (did you know this 1600 room hotel was a WEDDING GIFT for Bertha Palmer from her husband?!  I mean, it's no Taj, but still!).  This hotel is full of history and I am completely smitten.

I had never been inside the place before then but had heard great things about it from friends. The lobby area is very ornate and elegant. It literally feels like you're walking into a gold mine or something. The rooms are a different story, however. It was very small, the beds were full size, which is something I had never seen in a [Hilton] hotel before. The bathroom has the be the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my entire life. One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a ""cork fee"" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF??? I don't think so! If I come back here, it won't be to stay. The event itself was very nice and the restaurants and lounges seemed posh, so I'd come back for those.";2;0;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Great service. My food was okay and my date's was phnomenal! He took me on a tour of the place and told me about some of the history. And of course the lobby is breathtaking.

It was enough room for two people to relax and not feel cramped. My only gripe is that we ordered some room service and we paid $40 for 4 half sized diet cokes on ice. And heads up!

10/4/2010;1BD;2uZEpLX3znS3WuIXMWWp6Q;"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.";4;1;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

One question I have is, who puts a train line in front of a hotel? Perhaps at some point it seemed like a good idea but the noise can be disturbing. Fortunately, from the rooms you can't really hear the L running by, at least I couldn't from the 10th floor. The lobby area is impressive. The ceiling murals are grand giving it the feel of someplace special. Cell coverage in the lobby area and in other parts of the hotel are very spotty. This hotel seems like a popular place for group gatherings so if you're looking for something intimate, you should look elsewhere. I was there for a wedding and the place was overrun. Apparently there where three other weddings going on at the same time. The rooms have been remodeled. I stayed here a couple years ago and the place was looking its age. Now the rooms have been painted and fixed up. The furniture is more modern. However, the rooms are on the small side. Also the hotel is shaped like a U so some of the rooms are shrouded in darkness. Ask for a room with a view if you like light. I didn't have a minibar in my room which was troubling. I can't complain about the price though.

The only plus was that it was two blocks from the office from which I was working when I was traveling to Chicago. This hotel is so massive that one could lose ones way in its cramped and labyrinthine halls that span across three wings. The bathrooms were claustrophobic, the TVs had poor reception and the room service food was less than mediocre, thanks to the average 1-1.5 hour delivery time, I'm sure. Oh, and the air conditioning was so affective that I had to wear a sweatshirt in my room in the middle of the summer. They seem to cater well to their conventions and conferences than individual guests, probably because these conferences/conventions bring in a lot of money, but it is not a legitimate justification for the lack of appropriate attention towards the rest of their clientele.

I called the Palmer House's catering office and spoke with Jane Himmel, the Senior Catering Manager.  I inquired as to the availability of the Empire Room for our exact anniversary date, June 23rd - a Thursday.  Opportunity struck when I was told the room was not being used for a previously scheduled event that night. I suggested my idea to Jane that my wife and I have dinner for 2 in the Empire Room on the night of our anniversary, just as we celebrated our wedding there 10 years ago to the hour.  This is when Jane and her team took over. To my surprise and excitement, Jane took this idea from the start and worked very hard to make this idea, this dream, become a reality.  I worked with Jane over the next couple of weeks and days leading up to our night.  She helped me pull off one of the greatest nights and best memories my wife and I will ever share. The Palmer House is a beautiful and historic hotel.  Please consider when you stay here or have an event here that what you may be giving up in terms of modern amenities and size of the hotel rooms you gain in elegance, class, service, a sense of history and an experience to be had in your lifetime.";5;0;0;0;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

On balance this place is not bad, however; the service has been inconsistent on the last couple of visits. I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come. That day, the space also seemed to be filled with several young kids (think 9-13 year olds) as part of a family or other traveling group. Now, I am not anti-kid by any means, but these ankle-biters and their parents apparently didn't get the memo that children are to be seen and not heard.";2;1;1;1;N;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities.

(Pardon my French) First, when we checked in the folks at the front desk seemed to have some 'tude. This was a significant change from last time I stayed here when the service was impeccable. Even when I asked them for toothpaste and some safety pins, it seemed like a huge chore. Apparently when you ask for safety ""pins"" that also equates to just one. As far as service goes, there were a few redeeming factors, like the 'tender at the lobby bar, who was very fun, nice and energetic. Second, the decor is still chic and eco-friendly, but you can tell it's taken a hit over the years. Maybe it was just the room we were assigned (an ""01"" room right next to the damn elevator) but it was falling apart. It was way smaller than my room was the first time (read: a glorified closet), a huge chunk of decorative tile have been broken off the sink and another random part had fallen off and just placed on the counter. Really? You can't fix that before you place someone in probably your least desirable room in the entire hotel? The bedside lamps looked like they'd been knocked over at least 17 times. You could tell whoever cleaned the room prior to our check-in did a half-assed job. We even got a call from some friends who were also staying there who mentioned someone had taken a #2 in their toilet and they found it when they checked-in. Wow... The saving grace here amongst the elevator dinging and loud chatter all.day.long. was whoever cleaned our room for the rest of our stay. He or she fixed the pieces-parts in our bathroom and really made the place shine. I actually wanted to call the front desk just to give the house keeper praise. And, I realize I'm in Chicago, but $44 per day for parking is out of control. I'm pretty sure they're able to keep this hotel running based on that revenue alone. I now know better than to drive to CHI anymore. I am keeping Hotel Felix at 3 stars because there are still some great things about it, like: they're leed certified, eco-friendly, their 24hr fitness room with filtered water (I brought a cup and kept filling it, bringing it back to my room and enjoyed not paying for the water bottle in our room), the hotel resto is fab (but pricey), the beds are a dream to sleep in, free wi-fi and a great location to pretty much walk anywhere.

Got this place through priceline and paid a cheap amount, like 75 bucks or something. Good deal. It only costs a little less than 30 bucks to get here in a taxi from Midway so that was a good deal too. The hotel itself is really nice. Boutique hotels are funny in general to me. They are usually old buildings that have be renovated. This follows that path. Being that it is an old building, everything is small. Also with boutique hotels, they always try to be trendy and minimalist. I like more grand and luxurious hotels but that's my opinion and doesn't count against this place. I like that it is also LEED certified to be a green hotel. I'm all for saving the planet and stuff. The lobby was very nice, although small. Bellhops were friendly and helpful. Desk people were helpful and friendly as well. The room was very nicely appointed. Traffic outside could be heard even on the 9th floor but it wasn't horrible. And its a downtown hotel so again, this doesn't count against the hotel. The room was fairly small but again, that follows boutique hotels' style. The bed was comfy and the wall hung TV was cool. All my really problems with this place took place in the bathroom. The bathroom was nice and very spacious, almost as big as the room, but had major flaws. First, the sink was too trendy and didn't serve its purpose. The faucet was WAY to close to the bottom of the sink. To the point where you couldn't wash your hands without hitting your hands on the bottom of the sink or the faucet itself. pointless. Second, the shower curtain was too small for the shower. It only stretched 1/2 to 2/3 of the way at most. This made showering difficult as to not get the bathroom floor wet. I don't know why this was like this but it bothered me. I posted pictures of both these problems, check the photos. The hotel restaurant looked pretty cool and had a big bar. I didn't get a chance to go check it out in detail but it sure did look like a good time.";3;1;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

10/7/2011;0nQsBR7aaS9kwNSjV7oZ9w;5MCBLBxr10NLUKZ4AboAMg;"Frankly, I got the short end of the stick at Hotel Felix. Three day trip, late September. Roughly $200/night. (not that cheap!) Word to the wise, when you book via the hotel engines (Hotwire, Expedia, etc) you are typically filling up the most...err...undesirable rooms. Not always, but sometimes. You might end up in a great hotel, but be forewarned that you might get the ""blah"" rooms no one else wants. In this case. Most definitely. If you get assigned an ""01"" room at the Hotel Felix, try to get reassigned. it is DIRECTLY in the elevator bank basically. My boyfriend checked the floorplan and most definitely they carved an entire elevator out of this room, leaving it roughly at about 100SF, if that. It is TINY. Not just small, but terribly uncomfortable for any length of time. Impossible for two people. Claustrophobic. No closet space. Other than that this hotel is fine... Pros: *above average hotel restaurant: Elate. (and decent room service!) *great location, non-busy street. (Huron) in River North. *easy metered parking exists, 2 hour limits. *Staff is quite nice. *Free wi-fi Cons: *Room size *The coffee is always empty in the morning in the  lobby *$42 valet All in all fine, but was not totally comfortable in that size room with an elevator dinging ALLLLLL day/night.";3;12;5;3;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Staff was extremely friendly during our 4 day stay, saying hello and goodbye, offering their services and holding doors. The lobby area is beautiful and a great place to enjoy a glass of wine or cup of coffee. Rooms are very small and if you are a light sleeper, you will wake each time one of your neighbors enters or exits their room.  We also found the heat to be really hard to control.  It was always too hot or too cold in the room.  Barely any closet space and found that our suitcases took over the room because of lack of space to put things. Was warned by several people about my safety here, since a homocide happened over a month ago.  I though the location seemed very safe and that the hotel did a great job securing the hotel in the evening hours.  We walked almost everywhere and never felt like we were in a shady area. We got this hotel for a great price on PLN ($85 per night!) and for that price thought it was worth it for the location and hospitality.  Had we paid more, I probably would have expected more.";3;1;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

I, like Colleen, was assigned an ""01"" room near the elevator shaft. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Chatter. Chatter. Chatter. With the room itself being a bit larger than a walk-in closet, I made do because, well, there are worse things. But those two 4am bars' across the way? Their patrons screaming all night? No thank you. Maybe it was such that I was perfectly situated on the seventh floor, to get the brunt of the noise, the screams funneled directly into my room via wind and high-rise condos. People yelling and screaming and carousing late into the night = no sleep for this gal. Coffee? There was nada left when I came downstairs, but whatever... you can get coffee at myriad places in Chicago.

The hotel exterior (an older, renovated building) stands out with its huge (but not garish) sign.  The inside of the hotel is small--from the elevators to the lobby to the rooms.  I thought my room, which was on the top floor was actually not too small (maybe bigger than what some of the other reviewers had) and provided a decent view of some of the nearby big buildings. The room was very modern with modern but still comfortable furniture and kind of a minimalist approach.  The room was very clean and the bed was nice and comfortable (good linens too).  The bathroom was also nice though the sink was very shallow (you are likely to touch the sink basin as you wash your hands).  The shampoo and soap were provided by a local company (H2O, which you will also see on some United flights). The room featured your standard stuff like TV, room service, iron, ironing board, and ice bucket; complimentary internet access was also provided. In terms of amenities, there was a spa as well as a decent (though small) 24-hour fitness center. Service was good.  The front desk was pleasant and polite.  The bellhops were really good--friendly and very helpful. Room rates are high here though it is about what you would expect to pay for a nice boutique hotel with a good location (though the rooms here might be smaller than other boutique hotels).  You can get deals here though.  I think they did a Yelp discount here once and you can find pretty good room rates on the online sites like Expedia. Hotel Felix is a nice and modern hotel with a very good location.  It also meets my key needs of comfortable bed, comfortable room temperature, clean room, and a good shower.  While the rooms are not huge, the pros far outweigh that one negative and I would definitely consider returning here if I could find a competitive rate. For parking, I think it is pretty expensive--probably $35 or more.  Though to continue with their eco-friendly theme, Hotel Felix provides free parking to guests who drive hybrids.";4;13;12;11;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

The rooms were really cute, it was a little compact, but overall everything you needed was there. The amenities were great, everything they use is H2O, I actually didn't mind using their stuff. Usually, I have to pack my own bottles of everything but this time the hotel amenities were exactly what I wanted. However, all of that is trivial compared to the two things I use to rate a hotel - mattress and shower. The mattress was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel, you just kind of sink in and enjoy the TV. The shower was nice, nothing about it that stood out, but it was good.

A large flat screen TV and desk round out the notable features. Hotel Felix has a card entry fitness center that consists of 2 ellipticals and perhaps 2-3 treadmills and some free weights.  There is also a card entry business center with 3 computers and a printer for use anytime.

The standard rooms were uber-small (sub 200 sq ft) and the nice-looking amenities are of cheap quality. Seriously?

9/18/2010;nBLzK;5Y5KbsI5buMcNh2hTFaRpA;"I actually believe that Hotel Felix is worthy of 4.5 stars but couldn't feel good about giving them 5 because my room was located near the elevator on my floor - I could hear nearly all of the noise out in the hallway. I am not sure of there is a sound barrier issue in other rooms because my coworker was in another room (on another floor) and didn't come across the same issue. It wasn't terrible because the floor happened to be fairly quiet but the ding of the elevator's arrival during higher traffic times of the day was an annoyance. Now that I have gotten my witch ways out of the way....I can start to tell you why I am so smitten with the Hotel Felix. Here's a breakdown: 1. Location is fantastic and within walking distance of many conveniences that include Whole Foods, restaurants, bars, and shopping. This is just a short cab-ride away from practically everything else. 2) Hotel Felix did a fantastic job sticking with their Eco-friendly mission. I appreciated the fact that they utilize Organic materials, renewable resources and even the hotel's plumbing is most impressively energy efficient. Being a stickler for the word ""Eco-friendly"", they passed the test when their high-quality toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soaps, and lotion) were all not tested on animals either! A++++ 3) Although, there is no denying that the rooms are not large in size, Hotel Felix did utilize the space extremely well. My room had a small window in the far right of the room without a good view but it still shed enough light into the space.The stylish platform bed with drawers below, closet nook, and desk all fit nicely. The decorator did an amazing job of making everything look clean, modern, and cozy without looking like an IKEA catalog.The bathroom was spacious and well thought out with a large walk-in shower, vessel sink, and cabinetry for all of my ""products' to be neatly nestled into. This could easily pass for a well manicured studio apartment in NYC without any complaints.... 4) The Westin's ""Heavenly Bed"" has some competition because this bed was so comfortable! I could have laid in it all day! I also loved the neutral color throw that was at the end of the bed. Perfect to cuddle with. 5)The staff were always incredibly friendly and efficient from the front desk to the valet. I had forgotten my toothpaste (bonehead move) and a staffer delivered to my room a large sample size and even offered up a toothbrush! 6)The restaurant on the 1st floor, Elate is fantastic! I loved my experience there so much that I am writing a separate review! I would definitely recommend Hotel Felix to anyone who is looking for a not so vanilla experience. This boutique hotel is the way to go if you need a place to stay in downtown Chicago. TIP*** Just be sure to request a room that is not across from the elevator";4;1;1;1;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Hotel lobby bar was very small, only about 6 bar stools but they did have a little lounge area next to it.

(When booking through a third party you will sometimes be given the next available room if the one you want is unavailable.  We booked a double but got stuck with a single.)  Desperate and unwilling to share a bed with the two of them, I asked the man at the front desk if they had any other doubles available.  Fortunately for me they had one available and he was nice enough to give it to us.  It wasn't the biggest room, but the bathroom was decently sized and the beds were amazingly comfortable--so comfortable that the three of us slept through our alarms every morning.  The bathroom was one of the best parts of the room, second only to the beds.  It had one of those awesome shower heads that makes it feel like it's raining and there was never a towel shortage.  And of course, it came fully stocked with bathroom essentials--soap, shampoo and conditioner that delightfully smelled like the lobby, and q-tips & cotton balls.   As if things couldn't get any better, the staff was amazing.  Chuck the doorman was super friendly and knew everything there was to know about the city from which bars and restaurants to hit, to the most efficient route to get from one point to the next complete with directions so detailed that they included which set of stairs to take.  Even the late night staff was so helpful as to help my friend carry me back to the room after having a little to much fun our last night in town.";5;1;1;2;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

He was humble and friendly in a very professional way.  For my lunch, I ordered a romaine leaf salad whose dressing had just the perfect creaminess, and my friend ordered the steak sandwich which I highly recommend. Portions aren't big but just enough to fill you up.  The chef came out to greet us after we were done eating as well. My experience here was nothing less than excellent. I definitely recommend this as a business lunch place or if you just want to grab drinks they have a cozy bar as well.";5;1;1;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

If you are coming to Chicago, are you going to be in your room all day? They also allow you to park for free if you drive a hybrid. We have a Prius so that saved $42 a night for valet parking. The rooms are comfortable but, the walls are a little thin. Again, something I have experienced at other hotels. Overall, a great stay at a great little hotel.

I had to go for work and luckily had the freedom to choose my own hotel. I read about this place on the Chicago Visitor website and it got great reviews. I love little boutique hotels and this really exceeded all of my expectations. The beds are the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on in my entire life!! My view was pretty great too. It is walking distance (6 blocks) from Michigan Ave. The lounge is perfect and I spent probably every night here. Every night I would think of going down for just a night cap but ended up staying until they closed. They have quite the intimate setting with the fireplace and the cozy bar corner. The bar tenders are all charming and were a pleasure to be around. Housekeeping even went the extra mile to hang up all of the clothes that I had scattered all over my room after leaving for work and leaven them everywhere as if a tornado had just ripped through lol.

We arrived early for check-in and were pleasantly surprised by the VERY friendly doorman, and cordial front desk staff.  We were told they were sold out - so we didn't end up getting the room upgrade.   When we walked into our room we were quite pleased. Clean-very clean room, yes very small, but the modern decor, comfortable beds, and excellent location soon made you forget about it's size. We would definitely go back, given we find the same deal.  I'm not sure we would pay too much more to stay here, but would recommend it if it is in your price range.";4;0;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
12/12/2010;pY6IejPqZP;TIaGhZk3W4nA7AXroaIdjA;"I've found the perfect downtown hotel- finally (32/single/professional). I frequently travel to Chicago for weekend getaways and am thrilled that Priceline (Name your own price- $79/night) ""matched"" me with Hotel Felix. New. Clean. Modern. Great staff. I look forward to booking rooms at the Hotel Felix directly in the future. Several things really stood out with my experience. First, the self-park across the street was only $24/night. Most self-parks downtown nearer Michigan avenue are more like $35/night (there is also valet parking if you wanna pay for it). Also, Whole Foods is 2 blocks down the street, Walgreens across the street, dry cleaner down the street, old school barber down the street, 3 blocks from the nearest red line stop and about 4 blocks from Zara on Michigan Avenue. Another big winner for me was the the free WiFi through the hotel. No password. Easy. I stay at a lot of SPG properties and they are more than happy to charge you $20 a day or more for WiFi. This day of age, getting internet is almost as important as having electricity and running water in your room. Check-in was seamless. The H2O bath and body products were also a nice surprise. No bath- which other reviewers comment on- but it's not something I ever use. Esthetically the hotel is a cross between the W Hotel City Center and the Chicago Four Points by Sheraton. Despite having SPG ""gold"" status and being an AmEx SPG card holder, the W still throws me in their shoe box sized rooms where you can barely turn around. One poster said that this was a ""poor man's W hotel,"" but I'm kinda over the snooty service at the W. Didn't try the restaurant/bar- but both looked cute/cozy. Only criticism would be that the bed was more of a ""European Queen""- but not as obnoxiously small as the ""queen"" sized bed the Palmer house throws people into. Being a solo traveler this was totes fine. But if it was 2 'big boned' people they might have had some concerns. Also- the sink faucet was way to close to the basin to be useful. Clearly, the design team at Kohler was not consulted. Other more lackluster reviews on this hotel sited the lack of a minibar in the rooms. But I have to wonder if this is a criteria for ""LEED"" certification. The door men were helpful/upbeat. The developers/management team at Hotel Felix are truly to be commended. It takes a lot for me to be impressed in the service industry today. 5 stars not because it's a 5 star hotel- but because I had come to accept such lack luster experiences in Chicago's myriad of '4-star"" chain hotels. Others question the merits of this being a ""4 Star hotel."" My response to that is that most downtown Chicago hotels meet the criteria for being a 4 star hotel (all the horrible convention hotels; Sheraton/Hyatt/Hilton) but also consistently well-reviewed hotels like the Sofitel. I would never book a '4 star' hotel and expect anything other than the minimum criteria to achieve that ranking.";5;0;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

12/22/2010;XpnJisIuBC4elCJqwWPfAw;mZujTrZN57WyW9oEmqI1TA;"I was so worried about my stay at the hotel after reading some of the reviews online, but maybe the hotel felix is aware of their inconsistent reputation and is working to change it. I booked through a third party online site for a very low price for a friday night stay. I was traveling with my aunt, so it wouldn't have been a big deal if the room only had one bed, but I called two days before our arrival to put in a request for two beds. The representative I spoke with was very kind and accommodating, and told me she could not promise that the room would have two beds, but that she would note it on my reservation. When we checked in, the host had already set us up in a room with two beds, and away from the elevators. The room was a perfect size for one night (maybe not so for a family). The beds are not queen-sized, but they are so comfortable. The room had a pleasant smell, was quiet (although there is some noise from the hall), and the H2O spa amenities are fantastic. The sink in the bathroom was odd, but was not too difficult to use. I really liked that there were makeup removing towlettes, q-tips, and cotton balls available, as well as a small hair dryer. The shower was big and had a rainfall showerhead. The lobby is really beautiful, and in the morning they serve metropolis coffee! The doormen are so friendly, and had big smiles for us even at 7:30am in the very cold chicago morning. I would definitely stay here again!";4;2;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
3/12/2010;9499G7XoQNWD-wQO2Vto9w;_2lgix_-1sEb0tRPhnoRYg;"Like a number of other Yelpers, I stayed at Hotel Felix because I received a really good deal on Priceline. I would definitely not have a problem staying here again if I got another good deal (I ended up paying $60 a night pre-tax), but probably would not stay here if I had to pay full price. The first night a friend of mine stayed in the room with me, and although many yelpers have complained about the size of the rooms, I didn't think it was overly-small, even with two of us. The too-small bathroom, however, was a big problem for me, and it's the bathroom alone that took this from a 4-star to a 3-star review. I do get the eco-friendly thing and I understand that the sink is really shallow to save water, but, it was just a pain to use. Beyond that, my sink ended up clogging the night before I checked out, so it then became nearly impossible to use. Also, I didn't like that there was no real sink counter space. Beyond that, we did visit the hotel restaurant, Elate, and it was just ok--nothing to rave or rant about. The Good: - Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly the doormen, and check-in/check-out was seamless. - Although, as is typical with hotels in the area, valet is expensive ($45 p/night), there is a parking lot across the street that is a bit cheaper ($35) and a parking garage that is even cheaper ($23). - Hotel is in a good location; in walking distance of many restaurants, clubs, etc. and a short cab ride away from a lot of other high-profile downtown locals). - Free wi-fi. - The best assortment of tv channels I've ever seen in a hotel; and the tv was a well-placed flat-screen. - Way-comfortable beds. The Bad: - Supposedly there were no double-bed rooms available when I arrived, and the bed, while comfortable, was a little small for two people who aren't interested in getting ""romantic"". - While it wasn't a huge issue, we could hear noise outside of our rooms, e.g., the ice-machine and elevator. - Too-small bathroom with an impossible sink that ended up getting badly clogged. - There was only one mirror in the entire room, and it was in the bathroom (which makes it difficult for two women to get ready to go out on the town). - The nonexistent view. The window of my room looked out onto a brick wall. - We found ants crawling across the bedding twice.";3;0;0;0;N;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Honestly, from a monetary standpoint it was probably cheaper (and more relaxing!) to drink in the hotel lounge all night versus go out to the bars. Yes, the room is small, but it was clean! The ""complimentary"" bottled water in the room actually turns out to be a $10 ($5 each) charge on your credit card upon check out. I also had a $45 charge for valet parking, when indeed I self-parked and paid cash. I called the front desk to report the issue, though, and they immediately refunded me.

The rooms are very small and definitely meant for 1 person; for 2 persons it is a stretch. Closet space is tiny even for 1 person (it may be Ok if you travel without luggage or planning to stay just for one night). Admittedly, it is a very well kept place (probably in part due to the fact that it was just recently renovated). The shower is huge especially in comparison to the room size, but the bathroom sink has the weirdest design I ever saw. It is so shallow that it's difficult to wash your hands. Internet connection is painfully slow. The elevator's capacity is not enough for the amount wanting to use them. On the bright side, hotel staff is very friendly and attentive, but every once in a while it seems that they simply get overwhelmed and line to check in/check out can be quite sizible. The restaurant (Elate) is exceptional. We ate breakfast and lunch there on 2 separate days and the quality and taste of our fare was amazing. I would definitely recommend to try it.

The trip started out with difficult to understand but effective check in clerks but went downhill from there. On the way to our room we were trapped in an elevator for 20 minutes. It took that long to open it even with a hotel employee in the elevator with us to call for help; if it had been just guests in there who knows how long it would have taken. Once we were freed there was no contact from guest services to reassure us or offer a discount on the stay, just hotel security demanding our names and room numbers as if we had done something wrong. We weren't spending that much time in the hotel, just sleeping overnight and cleaning up in the morning but even that wasn't great. The mattress and pillows were poor quality, somehow managing to be not supportive but too firm at the same time. The bathroom was cramped, the shower was cold, and the facilities all looked like they had been repaired shoddily more than once. The walls didn't seem to stop much noise; I was woken up more than once by someone in a nearby room urinating (awesome).

The  majority of the staff was extremely rude. While checking in, I had one of the hotel porters nearly run me over while muttering ""damn"" under his breath.The room was tiny but that was to be expected seeing as the hotel has been around since 1893. I had to request a room change because the room smelled of mold and mildew and it appeared someone had dropped an iron onto the floor and left it for too long because there was still an imprint of the iron on the carpet. Our second room smelled better, but there were chips on the bathroom door. There was no fitted sheet on our bed. Just a top sheet covering the mattress and then oddly, a top sheet atop the comforter. I'm not sure if the housekeeping staff is so lazy that they can't make a bed properly or what. I noticed that there were several functions going on while staying there and it made me wonder; why if they make money on renting out rooms/dining halls for conventions or weddings etc. that they can't manage simple renovations? They can afford an automated self check in/check out machine but can't replace carpet or repair a bathroom door??

Not because it's old....heck, I'm old myself. But because the website gives the wrong impression as to what this facility has to offer. The rooms are especially horrible with paint sloshed over every single piece of hardware and dreadfully beat- up  woodwork in need of sanding.  The first room with a view of nothing but bricks was so awful that I asked for an upgrade. And I was given one..... for an extra $300.The ceiling in the large closet of my ""suite"" (and I use the term loosely),  hit the floor and stayed there for the remainder  of the visit.When I threw back the bed covers, what to my eyes should appear but an ant.Since I've been known to drop my purse on a restaurant floor, it occurred to me that I had brought it in myself.Wrong!The ants, who came through a hole in the wall,  were also all over the living room carpet. When I complained  to the  night clerk, he  said I must have left the window open. Does the place have a chef?  No. Only a cook,  who turns out  truly mediocre food. My order for soy chicken was so salty that it was like chewing grit...and   the rice served with the dish was a small, rock-hard lump. I received freshly cook rice after I complained to the waitress.  The whole thing should have never happened.Housekeeping?Oh yeah. That consisted of taking a swipe at the bathroom, making up the beds and vacuuming.  Dirty cups and dishes were untouched and no replacements  were provided.  The dressers, tables and other furniture were never dusted.The workers striking for benefits?I couldn't bring myself to cross that picket line, so I had to walk an extra three blocks to get to my destination. Good reviews?They were written by the hotel owners.Bad reviews?Right on brothers and sisters. You have covered about everything else that I wanted to complain about.Is there nothing good?Of course. The concierge, the doorman  and the regular staff were just wonderful. Kind and helpful to a fault.If you still want to stay there, ask for  a room with a view of Grant Park. You will have to pay more, but it's worth it. Breathtakingly beautiful. Well, that's about it. Remember, I have no reason to lie. All the best.";1;0;0;0;Y;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

I completely enjoyed my stay.  I was alone, they upgraded me to a king on the 7th floor.  Almost a corner room overlooking the park.  I was not visited by any ghosts but had I known this hotel was known for ghosts, I would have chosen another.  I'm glad I did not know.Yes, the room looked old with beautiful antique furniture, a safe in the closet if needed I could vividly imagine how it was as years ago.  It was quiet and warm.  I later learned I could open the bay-like windows and my view was amazing!  I could see the Ferris wheel lit up on Navy Peer and the beautiful park across the street.  I did not need any Internet access nor did I need HBO.  My room was absolutely perfect!  I got lost in the bed because it was huge and comfortable with 4 or 5 pillows.  It felt luxurious.  The bathroom was small but clean and had everything I needed.  The Kleenex box was fluffed up to look like flowers which was a nice touch.I used to clean hotel rooms and I am in the service industry so I am probably over critical.  I would have liked a mini-fridge for my leftovers.The bell boy was so helpful.  He offered suggestions on where to go and what to see.  Told me I could catch the 26 bus on the corner which took me right to the Union Station.  He told me Navy Peer was 2 miles away so I decided to walk there along Lake Michigan and it was awesome!  I took a cab back to the hotel, hopped the bus as instructed and took a ten minute ride to Union Station where I took the Mega Bus back to Minneapolis.";4;0;0;0;Y;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2/25/2012;VkZCGGbIy0glUWVj0Jm00g;q-k4mic1pT5KPhILGmGPhQ;"First off i'm going to start off by saying I NEVER write reviews for anything. Ever. But after reading all of the terrible reviews off of many different websites, I feel the need to share my experience! The staff was so helpful to me and some friends that stayed there 2/15 to 2/18. Anytime we needed help with something or needed a taxi, they immediately helped us out. The rooms were beautiful and had a 1920's vibe to it which I really enjoyed. it does get pretty hot in the room after a while, but its not hard to open a window and shut it when you get cold. The hot water does take a few extra minutes to come on, but I didn't find that a problem. The ONLY thing I have to complain about is how thin the walls are. We had a neighbor come to our room 3 times complaining of how loud we were, but we weren't even talking...it was our tv! Other than that this hotel was a wonderful place to stay and I don't regret it at all! So don't listen to all of the other bad reviews of the place. I believe you get what you pay for at the Congress Plaza. If you want a 5 star experience, then obiously you have to pay for it at a different hotel. No, the Congress Plaza wasn't a perfect hotel, but if you're just staying there for a few days and are looking for somewhere affordable with beautiful spacious rooms and a friendly staff, then I highly recommend you stay here! Yeah, the hotel is a bit run down, but its been in business for such a long time and I think that the history of the place is what makes it beautiful. Oh, and the strikers out front are no problem, they arent loud and they don't get in the way of anything. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel!";5;0;0;0;Y;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

The hotel is old! Simple as that. But I had no problems with odors or cleanliness. The staff were friendly and I had no unpleasant experience.

12/28/2011;-F3W-kCQEa6UoBvjbfAgDg;eSsevdI-CqWSAraiAmuNiw;"I stayed with a group at Congress Hotel in early December, and we loved it. We booked 2 rooms, each with 2 double beds on the 6th floor. The room rate was excellent. With tax, it came to about $130 per room, per night. Parking was not included, but for $28 (split among a few of us) the Congress will park your car in a secure lot overnight with the option to pick it up late afternoon the next day. Considering the Congress is smack in the middle of the South Loop, I'd say this was a pretty huge convenience. We could get brunch the next morning without having to worry about feeding a meter or moving our car.The inside of the hotel is a bit ""The Shining,"" but luckily a lot less creepy. It's very old. The hallways are long and off-white, but clean and warm. The rooms were very clean, with high ceilings and lots of outlets (small, old ones, but lots!). The bathroom was a decent size and yet again, very clean and well-stocked with towels and soaps.There was a nice-sized TV, a huge closet, a very large desk and multiple chairs. Our room overlooked the Auditorium Theater and a corner of Michigan Avenue. We stayed on a Friday night and the hotel was busy, lots of groups of twenty-somethings as guests. This was fine with us. Oddly enough, even though the hotel is old, the walls are not very thin, and we did not hear much noise from inside our rooms. We even took our time exploring each floor and the ballrooms, service stairways, and so on -- the hotel is full of awesome history. Make friends with the bellhop & security guard...you might get some scary stories outta those guys!The only thing that did *not* please me was the unfriendly desk associate upon check-in. She was helpful enough, and we got what we needed (checked in, room keys, a spare room key later, easy check-out via the TV in the room). However the Congress Hotel  charges you the minute you book the room, not when you check-out, like most other hotels I've experienced. Generally a hotel will keep your credit card on file during your stay and charge you upon check-out, in case of incidentals.When we arrived to check-in, I was told I'd need to provide a card on which they could ""hold"" another $100 for incidentals (even though they had already charged my card as a purchase and still had my info on file). When I explained that all I had was a debit card, and that the $100 would cause me to overdraw, the front desk worker told me, ""Any time you check into a hotel you have to give a security deposit. That's the way hotels work."" So I told her, ""Actually, every hotel I've ever checked into charges me upon check-out, and charges me later *IF* there are incidentals.""  Luckily a friend of mine presented a credit card and we were taken care of, but I don't appreciate being talked to like I've never used a hotel before.Aside from the 1 attitude problem, everyone at the Congress Hotel was very friendly and accommodating. The place is gorgeous. The bar is really cool. And the bellhop Carl was super fun to talk to about the history. I highly recommend the Congress for an inexpensive, clean, very convenient, historical & interesting stay.";4;0;0;0;Y;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

The look is nothing short of breathtaking, the tall glass exterior is stunningly beautiful. The feel is professional, yet manages to incorporate that human factor.

From the concierge, Anderson, who welcomes you thoroughly and lets you know just how much he enjoys his job and loves the city to the door men, especially Christopher who knows the city and can give you pointers like he were describing the a neighbor hood he had grown up in all his life. Again, the service. GREAT!! I can't think of the last time I had the pleasure of being happy to be around such magnificent personalities. My girlfriend and I truly didn't want to leave.

3/6/2012;RCKNSWBpkOHEKRTV4Ub8Ow;4w_BrmGTKneCXH6m8i7vsw;"One of the worse experiences doesn't even begin to describe the experience we had. My sister Caryn, had her thirtieth birthday here. I thought wow, a bit extravagant...but really it's a HUGE birthday marker for her and she really deserves to be pampered. So I though, why not? They'll make sure she's taken care of...BOY WAS I WRONG, read her testimonial since I wasn't there with her bad experience...SO, MY bad experience she didn't mention. A week prior my sister asked me if I wanted to get a treatment and have a girls day for her birthday. Very EXCITED I said yes, and asked her to book me a facial. The night before (less than 12 hours notice) they contacted her and stated they were cancelling my appointment and gave no reason. Caryn doesn't like to complain and asked me if that was ok...I was disappointed but, didn't want to cause a problem and just let it go. Later that night we were supposed to have dinner at AJA, Dana hotel's restaurant. When we walked in the restaurant's hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we had a reservation with Caryn. We had to call Caryn for the hostess to acknowledge we had a reservation. The hostess told us that we HAD to wait for the rest of the party in the bar area WHICH IS NOT HEATED and it was the same temperature as the outside. My Father, who is elderly, could not sit in this cold room and we insisted to be seated. After having an argument with the manager they obliged. We sat down and the bus boy proceeded to pour water in our glasses and our laps. YES OUR LAPS. For some bizarre reason he poured the water into the glass spilling it and then proceeded to continue to pour outside the glass on the table and into our laps. And he did that to all 15 settings of the table.Caryn had not arrived and we didn't want to spoil her evening so politely mentioned it to the waiter and he apologized. We ordered our drinks and they gave us a canter (of sake) that leaked. SO half the sake went into the glass and half went onto the table. The waiter apologized and was super embarrassed. He was kind enough to give us extra napkins to clean up the mess the buss boy and the faulty canter created.We ordered our food...Which was a complete disaster and completely disorganized. One by one when our food eventually came out. SERIOUSLY EVENTUALLY, from the time we ordered the food to the first course to arrive at our table was an HOUR. By this time we were all RAVENOUS but, relieved at the sight of the first plate coming out. We were all staring at the first plate of food, like starving wolves just coming out of winter and finding a dead carcass, and thinking in relief, ""OH GREAT, my food won't be very far off behind."" YEAH, we were wrong. Not wanting to be rude the ONE person who got their food waited until someone else got their food...Which was 10 minutes later...I KID YOU NOT!  I have never had service like this. Literally only one person every 10 MINUTES got their food. The food was cold by the time the next plate came out. By this time we encouraged everyone just to eat when they got their food. The delivery of the food was to ridiculous we actually asked the staff to cancel the rest of the orders. 10 Minutes later the REST of the food arrived! Miraculously.It only took TWO HOURS TO GET EVERYONE ONE FED. I use the word FED loosely. This whole dinner was supposed to be $1000...for a $1000 dinner one would think they would have their stuff together and at the very lease feed the customers properly. After dinner here we had to have dinner again somewhere else. The portions were substandard, wasn't all that good, and the service lacked. Our waiter did what he could with what he had so, I can't say he was a bad waiter...Just everything else.After that pathetic dinner My family went upstairs to Caryn's room  when we arrived at the floor there was BOOMING music coming from all directions. I asked Caryn if she was taking us to the night club, she laughed and said ""No, Apparently this is the party floor."" The room was nice and spacious and the view was nice. The wait staff arrived to set up the room for her party (which is why I am surprised that they gave her such a hard time after we left)Overall, I am very disappointed in this whole experience and I am even more so upset that our family PLUNKED down all that money for a special occasion that was ruined by Dana Hotel.

Okay, meant to say just a few comments and this ended up being much more...I will admit that I was a little worried we were too ""casual"" of a couple to stay there. No need to worry. There was a diverse group of people that stayed there - business travelers, young people, ""my age"" range and thankfully older, people in jeans or shorts or dressed to the nines. We wanted a hotel w/o kids, and found it. I know how that sounds, I have older kids and this was our much deserved getaway so did not want to be surrounded by kids of any age!Location was excellent! It was within walking distance of restaurants, Magnificent Mile, etc. There is a small parking lot right next to the hotel but runs about $40 per night. It is valet parking and unlimited exits w/o extra charges. Very nice hotel, though we didn't get a chance to visit the spa, bar, club or restaurant. Some other reviewers complained about noise from the club, but we didn't hear anything and we were on the 22nd floor. Loved our room! We had the Cozy King, we booked too late to get the Corner King. It didn't matter, the windows are floor to ceiling and it was wonderful, not disappointing. Great views as well. Big fan of the B&W Zeppelin iPod dock! Great addition to the room. Glad to see the hardwood floors in the room (there was carpet as well), perfect for those who are a little eek-ish about walking barefoot in a hotel room. Also loved the bathroom and shower. There is no door on the shower so water does seem to spray everywhere. Not really a gripe, but as we were checking out the fridge and beverages, someone before us had already opened the Voss water and cleverly concealed that it had been opened. We left a note every day we left the room, but no response from housekeeping. There was also a large hole in one of the robes and were hoping we wouldn't get charged for that or the opened Voss water, we never did. There is a workout room and a fantastic locker room! Regular showers along with multi-jet showers. The multi-jet showers did not have great water pressure) and complimentary shampoo, conditioner, etc. They had lockers with washcloths, towels, robe, slippers, toiletries. There were also little baskets  with items you might have forgotten to pack - toothbrushes, feminine products, Q-tips, etc. I felt so special! They left two complimentary conditioners, as if they knew I have long, thick hair! Ha! Just an FYI, it is not soft water so beware for those of you that are used to soft water at home. I used both conditioners on my hair during one shower, because of it.We definitely plan on staying at this hotel again when visiting Chicago, without a doubt.

We needed to check in early that day to have somewhere to get ready (traveling from Detroit) to make it to the church by 3:30 pm. The hotel checked us in early over the phone while we sat traffic (at no extra charge), and when we arrived at the hotel with only minutes to spare (thanks to sitting in traffic for an extra unexpected hour) the front dest attendant not only sensed and acknowledged our urgency but took care of everything for us lickity split (literally, we were in the elevator, on our way up to the room within 45 seconds of walking in the front doors of the hotel... as all of our friends were walking out and getting onto the shuttle to go to the church). And we ended up making it to the church on time. Later that night, when we ordered a (extremely overpriced but well worth it) bottle of Veuve, the guy on the room service end of the phone was super cool and the delivery was very fast, as requested. Same with ordering breakfast the next morning - polite, fun and fast. Not to mention, the rooms are gorgeous and clean - we didn't want to leave but couldn't afford to stay.

My dad canceled that account and alerted the hotel of this in advance, and then when we checked in, he offered to put another credit card on file and the front desk said that wouldn't be a problem. My extended family decided to stay in town for an extra 2 nights, and in advance my dad asked to extend the reservation. He repeatedly went to the front desk to ask if they needed a credit card on file and if they needed to transfer the room into my aunt and uncle's name. The front desk said that would be no problem. When my father checked out, he again confirmed that my family would be staying in the second room and if everything was okay, and the people at the front desk again said no problem.After my family arrived back in New Orleans, they had hysterical voicemails from my aunt because she was locked out of the room. The front desk said the rooms weren't paid for or reserved, so instead of contacting my aunt or my dad -- or even bothering to leave a note on their door, where all of there stuff was -- they just locked my family out. My dad was on the phone for nearly 2 hours between my frantic aunt and the hotel management who blamed my dad for the miscommunication, despite the fact my dad asked the front desk SEVERAL TIMES if the room was reserved for an extended stay and if they needed info on file (turns out, the morons at the front desk never bothered to write anything down). When everything was finally worked out, my dad asked for the hotel to comp him part of the rate for all of the headache and aggravation he went through and for locking my family out of their room without a notice and they said THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. Um, bull.My dad held his ground and said that it was ridiculous that because of their negligence we had to go through all of this, so they finally gave my aunt 50% off their last 2 nights and 3 breakfast coupons. Took a few hours to get that.Everyone understand that people make mistakes, but the hotel failed by not only refusing to acknowledge that they made one, but then they tried to blame my dad for it instead of own up to the mistake and simply fixing it.I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL!";1;0;0;0;Y;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

During my stay there we could hear every other guest flushing there toilets and closing there doors. We went to bed to these sounds and was awaken to the flushing of the toilets all night long.

There was also a sauna and a weight room with multiple different machines to use for almost any workout. TVs in weight room. Only negative things about the hotel I could say is that the sauna wasn't working when we stayed there and the air conditioner and heater were controlled based on season and worked by water pipes hot or cold. You could choose automatic or manual fan settings. When they put on the cold air it worked very nicely.

I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel recently due to the recommendation of a friend, an unexpectedly good rate, and because the location happened to be perfect for what I was after.

Millennium Park and the Art Institute are within easy walking distance as you head south, and some Magnificent Mile shopping (Nordstrom and such) is within easy walking distance to the north. (Note that if you're more into the Barneys / Oak Street area of shopping then the location would not be ideal - too far of a hike.)The hotel definitely seems to be geared toward a younger, drunker set. Not to be too harsh, but there were a lot of douchebaggish and wannabe douchebaggish types. I saw a few families here but can't imagine that the place is ideal for small kids, given the noise level, and the fact that the bathrooms (at least in the standard room I was in) only have showers and not bathtubs. By the way, the shower was awful. Very inconsistent water pressure and temperature, and one of those eco, or is it Euro, type of unmovable partitions instead of a shower curtain or door, so that you basically have to get in the shower completely to turn on the water. On the plus side, the bathroom and the room in general seemed clean, modern and fresh.Overall I felt the hotel was ok for a night or two but as a thirty-something I just felt too old for the place.

Second, there are 4 elevators for 33 floors so there is ALWAYS a long wait (at least 10 minutes) for a lift. Third, the cleaning staff came to clean my room at 9am on a Saturday morning and never came back to clean, replenish towels, or make the beds. Forth, was charged for mini bar items that neither I, nor my guest, used. Fifth, when I checked in around 1130pm the previous Friday, there was a very loud music in the lobby lounge making it nearly impossible to hear the receptionist tell me where my room was, nor was there anyone there to help with my bag. Lots of negatives for the ""5-star"" hotel. However, there were times where the staff redeemed itself: The strap to my heel broke and I was able to call the concierge to get super glue to fix it, and the valet hailed a cab for me and helped load my bags.

11/10/2011;DFGJroljdjzVmX-H65FHtA;4AlPmQpqTHlhwbAYaOC_GQ;"This is the last time I book any of my colleagues and clients at this hotel. We've booked with W Chicago-Lakeshore  in the past and there has always been something but this time around was the final straw. I booked a hotel stay for one of my colleagues and my colleague was suppose to check in on Sunday. I called a week prior to his check in date to prepaid for his stay (since every time I asked for a CC Auth form, I never received it). The account woman took everything over the phone and said my colleague was all set. Here comes Sunday, the day my colleague is set to check in. They will not let him check in because they require him to put his card down for room & tax. My question is...what's the point of prepaying for a room when the guest is going to have to put down his/her card for ROOM & TAX plus incidentals. My colleague called me explaining the situation that Sunday night. Then I called the hotel and spoke to the night manger, who name begins with a G. She herself told me that she can see that an authorization has been made to his account but the account woman clearly didn't input the hard swipe. Another question I have to ask, why is that our problem? That was negligence on your employee's part not ours. Then, for her to say we have to put down for incidentals and a night stay in order to stay at the hotel(which would have been $650+, after I repeatedly told her I would send the details over to her first thing in the morning and my guest can not pay for this. I don't think Ms. G understands that everyone doesn't have $650+ to give at the drop of a hat.

Someone had to actually make the decision to put concrete on the walls. Didn't that designer have a boss to question that? Anyway, the rooms were fine but they had bugs. That's the worst sin a hotel can make in my opinion. The continental breakfast was as disgusting as I have ever seen in a hotel. The ""eggs"" were covered in cheez-whiz. Gross! They say there's no such thing as a free lunch, and I guess you can say the same about breakfast. Also, I am not usually a big allergy sufferer, but as soon as I walked into the building, I sneezed four times, and couldn't breathe until I left. I don't know if it was the cleaning materials, beds, blankets, or something else, but if you have allergies you might want to pass on this one.";3;0;0;0;Y;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

6/11/2012;yZvTHIT6H2DvtDpCp2NbPQ;mHMMjV3wqFTKfMAkqUYfLA;"We just got back home from the Radisson. This place is just awesome.Parking is underground, as with most of Chicago's hotel, it is $43 daily and does not offer in/out privilege. Valet parking is $53 daily.  The underground parking was a bit of a maze, as it seems to handles more than just the Radisson, and depending on where you are parked, you may not be close to the elevators that are for the Radisson, otherwise you come out from the side and have to walk around the building. No big dealThe lobby was beautiful, nice fresh light brown/cream color, the lighting was soft, not overpowering. From the lobby you have access to Filini restaurant and bar. It seems that it was always busy with people walking in and out all the time. The bar was all white, with all sorts of bottles throughout the wall. I did not have a chance to try the bar or restaurant. Check in was fast and quick, I was greeted by my name and thanked for being a Club Carlson member. I was asked if I have stayed before at Radisson, which I haven't. The check in area was lightly colored and very bright lighting. I booked a executive/business room package, which allowed me early check in, I actually checked in @ 11am. Our room was on the 17th floor with lounge access. The common hallways where light green/gray in color with soft lighting. I got 2 queen beds, overlooking Chicago River and Navy Pier. Room decor was modern, European style, carpeting on the bedroom was actually light blue, also the comforter. It took me some time to get used to the color, but it was not bad at all. Bed was comfortable, 2 plushy pillows per bed, with 2 extras on the closet. The mini bar was completely full with amenities and the prices I found them to be reasonable. The mini bottles were around $5-$6, soda $3. My only complaint is that they did not give you any room to cool a bottle of water or can of soda. The bathroom was very spacious, the shower and toilet where side by side, like in a closet, sharing a glass sliding door. The shower is similar to those of Aloft hotels by Sheraton, with a rainshower head, and a shower wand. This hotel does not skimp on towels, we got 4 each, large, medium & small. They were very soft and heavy. The whole bathroom floor was dark with glass crystals that gave different colors as the light shined. My wife was very pleased with the amenities kit in the bathroom, though I forgot the brand name. The coffee machine was a Nespresso and it came with 6 pods of coffee.The lounge was in the 17th floor also, by the elevator area, overlooking Millennium park, it also has a deck too. It was also lightly colored with blue chairs. It is open from 6am-10pm. You need room key for access to it. It is unmanned between 10am-4:30pm. They have a wide selection of magazines and a tv viewing area. You can rent out free of charge an ipad if you have a business package. Breakfast is from 6am-10am, it consisted of oatmeal, plantains, hard boiled eggs, pastries and fruits. Refreshment had juice, soda, water (gas and no gas) a coffee and tea area. Lounge is still open after breakfast, except they only leave the tea, coffee (Nespresso machine), soda water and the fruit tray. From 4:30pm they have a welcome reception with wine, champagne and beer. They also had some chips, crackers and nuts. Beer was Bud, Bud light, Stella, Lagunita, and 2 local Chicago craft beer from Argus Brewery.The third floor gives you access to the indoor and outdoor pool, sauna, exercise room, and an outdoor recreation area with a park like setting. Nicely landscape with a .5 mile softly padded exercise track that goes around the hotel, and pool area. There are some bbq grills throughout the area for the residents, cabanas, and benches all around.Second floor gives you access to the restaurant.We were very pleased with this stay, the hotel is beautiful, fresh, crisp and hip. I will certainly recommend it to anyone. It is within walking distance to Millennium Park, Michigan Ave, and State St.";5;0;0;0;Y;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

As a creature of habit and loyal to quality brands I typically stay in the same hotels and even the same rooms. I recently received an e-mail from the good folks at Club Carlson about the Radisson Blu in the Windy City and decided to try it out. First of all, it's a great location in downtown Chicago with great views from just about every angle and a short walk from the CTA. A short walk across Wacker will put you right on Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile. Upon entering the hotel you will find a modern and attractive lobby - much like a W Hotel minus the ""cheesy"" factor. For germaphobes like me, the wooden floors are perfect and perfectly clean as is the bathroom. The lighting is plentiful, the beds really comfortable, and the best part is that the TV channels are mostly in HD. I was assigned a corner room on the 16th floor with a balcony and plenty of windows. The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. This is not your daddy's Radisson - it's a whole new and refreshing experience - particularly for those of us who can't be home most of the time, but can 'come home' to a really comfortable and classy setting.";5;0;0;0;Y;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

9/21/2009;qO2pTetSOVUYmQGFhwIg9Q;KcHGO-5qw03HYjtk5k3CzA;"This place was a big disappointment.  The experience really dulled my view of the W brand.  - We were initially placed in a (tiny) room directly across from an elevator bank.  We were kept awake until about 4:30am by guests in the hallway and, alternately, the elevators' chimes.  The noise began, again, around 7-7:30am.  - Without apology, the hotel said they would move us to another room the next day.  We were told we could just leave our bags in the room and they would move everything by our return that afternoon.  When we returned late in the day to get ready for a wedding, our things hadn't been moved and a new room hadn't been arranged.  After re-explaining the situation, we were offered another room with a smaller bed.  ""How much less is it a night?  We pre-paid for a king.""  ""Same price,"" the receptionist said.  ""Why would someone opt for a smaller bed at the same price?""  ""Some people like smaller beds,"" she said.  ""Yeah, but we pre-paid and opted for a King size...""  To which she said, and I'm not even kidding, ""You'll be fine.""  At which point she handed us our key.  We moved our luggage, ourselves, to the new room.  - A bunch of the cable channels weren't working properly.  But, more annoyingly, the in-room pay per view movies weren't working.  We called the front desk and they said nothing could be done.  We asked that we not be charged for the movie we couldn't watch - no problem, they said.  Apparently, there was a *little* bit of a problem because I still got charged for it and then had to plead at check-out for the charge to be taken off.  - On our final night's stay there was no running water (!).  This was Labor Day weekend, a different weekend than what was mentioned by another commenter without water.  So I guess it's a recurring issue at this hotel.  Except we didn't get offered a bottle of water or anything.  Sure, the hospitality business isn't easy - there are things that are beyond management's control.  But when you sell yourself as being a luxury brand and charge accordingly, you can't have multiple problems for a guest's stay.  And you *definitely* can't have even ONE of these issues without being extremely apologetic.  We didn't get any of that.  And it's not like we were making anything even resembling a big stink about anything at the time - though maybe we should have.  You know what would have gone a long way?  A complimentary *anything*.  It's not hard and makes slighted guests feel better:  Sorry you couldn't sleep last night, how about a cup of coffee?  Sorry we can't accommodate the size bed you pre-paid for, can we give you a drink at our bar?  Would you like us to move your luggage to your new room like we said we would?  Sorry about the water not running, here's a bottle of water on the house so you don't have to use the $5 bottle of water from the mini bar.  Nope, none of that.  Just a ""you'll be fine"" from the front desk.  Yeah, of course we'll be *fine* - but we're paying a bunch of cash to stay at a friggin' W Hotel, not a Best Western.  After my stay, the manager-person sent me a form-email asking how wonderful my stay was.  I decided to write back to see how/if they'd make amends.  So I wrote an email listing the issues.  The manager sent back another cookie-cutter email with an added line about trying to see if they could make the elevators quieter... and that she looked forward to me having a better time next time I came back to Chicago.  Huh?  Next time??  This experience has put me off staying at *any* W Hotel - least of all the the W Chicago - City Center.";1;0;0;0;Y;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

Perhaps these people were just exceptionally loud? But even without the noise, the King bed in our room was simply awful- it was rock hard and actually slanted towards the floor. The room itself, as so many others have pointed out, is very small (especially with a king bed) and the bathroom tiny, but  clean and well designed.

Staff on the ground floor were very friendly and directed us to the 3rd floor. Check-in went very smoothly and we got a room on the 25th (top) floor. The living room had a large, flat panel TV with an extensive selection of channels. The bedroom was nicely finished and clean. Bathroom was also neat and tidy. Housekeeping kept our room clean and actually arranged our toiletries in such a manner that we maintained throughout our stay.We ate at the Omni breakfast buffet in the 676 restaurant on the 4th floor every morning because the kids love buffets (and ate for free) and it was good. They really need a separate station for omelettes and other custom egg orders because waiting for eggs in the middle of the buffet hampers the flow. The staff was friendly which was nice given that there was an automatic 20% gratuity levied on our group of six.The daytime concierge for the first half of our stay (Marcus) was extremely friendly and he sat with a disposition that communicated ""I'm here to help!"" The other concierge always looked as though he was busy doing something so we never really disturbed him.The health club on the 5th floor provided the essentials and never got too busy.The adjoining pool was suited perfectly for my kids (3' 6"" from end to end). Numerous games of beachball volleyball. Hot tub was good and there was a general disregard for the sign that indicated that there was a three-person limit.Location, location, location! Perfectly placed on the Magnificent Mile. Hotel entrance is just off of N Michigan and never got too busy in front. If you are traveling with children then I strongly recommend this hotel. That being said, I would still consider staying at the Omni again even if we leave the kids at home.I also recommend that you get the Select Guest membership.

On top of that, the safe within the room was faulty, as the same thief also managed to get into our safe and steal tens of thousands of sentimental jewelry and electronics. The situation was only made worse by the horrifying response of the hotel staff, who showed absolutely no shock, surprise, or apologies when we informed them of the situation. The security in this hotel is terrifying, and even the cops handling our situation told us they would absolutely not stay there. While the cops were in our room getting the details, they were called down to the lobby for ANOTHER security breach in which a homeless man was walking around and wandering into rooms inside the hotel, until he pushed open a door and walked in on a family of four who tackled him to the ground. Now the hotel has told us that they accept absolutely no responsibility for any of our missing items, including the belongings within the safe, because of the faulty door that THEY gave to us!

He was a sweetheart and super helpfulThe Bad:-old, old building with THE SLOWEST, tiniest elevators, ever-front desk stuff that were, well, not so bright (best example of this is when I had to get the manager to call my credit card company and reverse the room charge after I told them explicitly I wanted to pay cash. This could have very well ruined my entire weekend, not to mention my ability to shop/eat, if the charge hadn't been dropped)-stairwells smelled like piss-puny, old bathrooms with barely enough room to turn around in(sink is actually located outside the bathroom itself)-very noisy in the halls, and in the room above us (elephants?) and little will on the part of hotel staff to do anything about itMaybe some of my beefs are a little circumstantial, but I still don't think it was worth the price I paid.

The place also has a pool, which I never tried, and also has a pizzeria, which I did not try as well.  The cleaning service is top notch.Is there a better hotel for the price range in downtown Chicago?  Maybe.  This is very much your average hotel, but I'm sure the parking option will attract customers.  The location helps too!";4;0;0;0;Y;purV29eUqYRBrVvgqeyt_w

""Hey, that place looks nice, I'd like to stay there one day."" I spend a lot of time in downtown chi and rarely feel like driving home after a fun night. I remember, one night in July, I walked into this Westin with my girlfriend Lydia to inquire about the room rates for the night. We were spoken to (very rudely) by a humongous and very unattractractive manager, (I feel bad talking about him because he didn't make himself and everyone has flaws, I'm not a hyocrite) but I feel that he was taking his unhappiness with his appearance out on us. He told Lydia and I that there were no vancancies at the hotel, but a white couple walked in behind us and he ""magically"" found accomodations for them. They stated that they had not made pre-reservations and were walk-ins just like us. I wish I had gotten their info. I wrote this experience off as being a ""glitch in the system"". I returned to this hotel with my clubbing and dining buddy Lydia again after having a ""girl's night out at Ruth's Chris"" where I picked up a $350 tab. We were unable to finish our meal and had 95% of it wrapped up for enjoyment later at the hotel. This didnt happen. Due to stress, I had a panic attack and Lydia drove me to the nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital. I stayed there for about 7hrs. When I returned, Lydia called me and said that our dinner had been either thrown away or eaten by the hospitality staff.            Talk about a waste of money. Lydia complained to Sean, the manager on duty, and she and was given a meager $25.00 credit to be used at the bar downstairs in the lobby. The food at the Grill was nice. However, the very next day Chicago Police was called on me because the $5,000+ charge that had been authorized on my account for an approximate 2 week stay had exceeded by daily charge limit which is only $5,000 per day. I was told by the same manager, Sean and head of security, Ray Parede,s that my credit card was stolen and that ""those people"" and ""n words"" do this allk the time at this hotel. They said I had placed 2 different addresses on file. Did they ever think I have 2 residences???????? DUH, or are black people not allowed to OWN multiple properties? Are we not allowed to blow 5K on a 2 week hotel stay. The police showed up, verified my identity, and basically stayed in my room for 2hrs until I could call the bank and authorize the card for more money. In the interim, I missed a very important business meeting and a relaxing 4hr spa treatment. OMG, hope I don't have another panic attack. And to think Westin claims this hotel offers a retreat feeling. I feel worse than I felt at the hospital. A $440/night waste. But I feel like a young MLK doing a PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION to take a stand against the unjust treatment of ANYONE, regardless af gender, sexual orientatation, race, culture, religion, etc. Feedback is welcome.";1;0;0;0;Y;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

I just asked for some towels and toiletries and went to bed. The second night they gave me a certificate for a free night, as it was already 11pm! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning....what a mistake. My omlette and toast were burned. They took a while to be served as well. When I complained, they offered to make it again, but I had to leave for the trade show (I worked a booth). They still charged me! They took off 20%. I complained later to the front desk. They did not remove the charge. They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast that I never got to use :( Not enough?

Even though the event is over, I just can't stop thinking about how hard she worked, her kindness, her sincerity, her professionalism, her attention to detail, her enthusiasm...the list goes on!  Throughout the entire planning process (and the wedding week-end) I never really had to ask her for help with anything nor did I worry about anything because she always anticpated my needs before they were a thought in my head. We recently re-located to Madison, WI so planning from a distance was a challenge. She was always accommodating and flexible to our schedule and made sure we were well taken care of when we got to town the week-end of the wedding. I could tell that she was genuinely enthusiastic about our wedding throughout the entire planning process, our entire wedding week-end and even post-wedding! Our vendors were excited to work with her and they raved about how great she was so great to work with. Our guests also raved about the elegance that was orchestrated by her and your staff. You can tell she is really good at what she does and we really thought you should know how awesome we thought she was too!I also wanted to tell you that Beth Jostes was also amazing the night of our wedding. She took good care of us into the wee hours of the night. I know our group must have been a handful and she was extremely attentive, down to earth, very helpful, patient and fun to work with. Finally, every one of your staff we encountered was extremely welcoming and kind. I regret that I do not remember their names but it was your desk staff and bellman that were the most memorable. They remembered us by name each day, made us laugh, offered sweet marriage advice and were always smiling. They treated us like family.This was by far my most memorable hotel experience of my life.

7/1/2010;A3_51OtozG7wrsgCtV2G9w;EdBpBEKvQQSbje2nCyowCg;"DO NOT book your wedding at this venue.  Of all of the vendors I anticipated problems with when I booked my wedding, this would have been my last choice, and was by far the worst to have to deal with.  Initially booking under the excellent wedding coordinator of Rebecca Kuzelka, we were unaware that she would be abruptly let go a few weeks later.  Which the hotel did not contact me about, rather I found out through a returned email that I sent to Rebecca.  She was then replaced with the existing events planner who quit a few months later, the Doubletree once again never letting me know of the change, rather I found through a phone call to the Doubletree where they told me she was no longer there.  Finally they hired a new wedding coordinator, Brooke Bosak.  She did a nice job picking up where the others had left off, however her assistance in the back-office proved to be poor which is why I am writing a negative review.  These are the reasons we were dissatisifed with their service:- The final bill was incorrect, not taking into account the down payment we had made on the venue (which was a large percentage of the total cost) and incorrect service rates were used, that we did not sign on in the original contract.- In the final set-up (which I received a few days before the wedding because the ""system was down"") they had the wrong set-up (rounds of 8 instead of rounds of 10 which I had gone over with all three coordinators).  This would have been a disaster if I wouldn't have caught it because we had assigned seating at the wedding.- We went on our honeymoon immediately after the wedding.  I returned from my honeymoon to the incorrect amount being charged to my credit card for the reception with the old service rates (which I had fixed before the wedding) but had been changed back and charged to my credit card without my approval.  - Was charged $1,000 worth of room damage to our hotel suite which was absurd.  When I asked the hotel to provide reasons for this damage they provided pictures of three pathetic scratches which looked like normal wear-and-tear and could have been rubbed out with polish.  One of the tables they sent a picture of with a scratch on it was never even used by us during our stay. Also provided a picture of a hanging light the photographer had moved during pictures that was somehow shattered in the picture (but was not on our departure).  I accepted responsibility for that because the photographer had moved it, that was worth maximum $20.  All of the bridesmaids (which included 6 adult women) who I told about these charges and had been in the room that day were disgusted with the Doubletree for this.  I was able to get them to take off $500 after complaing and then another $50 when I reminded them that they shattered one of my champagne glasses at dinner.  I was acutally going to let that go, but not after this!- The night before the wedding I went to my maid of honor's room to share a bottle of wine before the big day.  We called down for a bottle opener and it took an hour and a half for them to bring it.  If you don't want to deal with a headache, then don't book your wedding here.";2;0;0;0;Y;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

The hotel found a way to work around that, AND they called me and asked whether there was anything that the hotel could replace to make my stay more comfortable.

Although the hotel looks beautiful, I would avoid staying here, no matter what, because what happened to us was not an aberration, but a result of hotel policy. They called us just after midnight, when we were about 10 minutes from arriving and told us the hotel was oversold and that our room was not available. Their solution was for us to come in and get our ""walk slip"" and then take it to another hotel in the suburbs near the airport. We were to pay full price and the other hotel was not a suite, but a room with one bed. So $250 bucks for a room comparable to what we could have booked for 75 bucks. I told them that staying in a room on Michigan Ave, in a suite with a pool and spa on the 30th floor is a bit different from a roadside motel in the suburbs. The person calling told me, ""since the city is oversold, that is all we can offer."" I explained that we had booked weeks in advance, that we were following each other in 2 cars in a city we didn't know well after midnight and that we had already driven over 600 miles that day and we were quite tired, so trying to find another hotel and then having some of us sleep on the floor was a real inconvenience. I asked for a second room, or to be booked in a downtown hotel and they simply repeatedly said, ""Sir, I am only authorized to put you in this room."" We were moving from California to Virginia and we were very excited to stay at this hotel, because the suite allowed my college age son and his finace the pull out sofa in the living room, while our 5 year old could just sleep in the king with us. The location is great and we had lived there when oldest son was a toddler, so we were going to show them the area and to go to the Cubs game the following day at noon. So we were very bummed about not staying downtown.I began to feel very sorry for the employee who had called us because she let slip that she had done this several nights in a row and that she was very embarrassed about this hotel's policy about over booking. She clearly understood that we were not going to be able to find another downtown hotel at this late hour. When I went on the hotel website to make a complaint to the central office, I was surprised to see that the Hilton site has a tab for complaints about overbooking of their hotels, so this is clearly an ongoing problem for this chain and in particular this hotel. Fortunately, we usually stay at Marriott's and since we have ""gold status"" from business travel, they were able to find us a hotel in the suburbs with 2 rooms for 75 bucks per room. We finally got to our room at 2:20am.  I stay about 75 nights a year in hotels, which is not usually fun, but if you book in a nice hotel, the service is usually great and in the 21st century, you can certainly expect a room to be held for you when you arrive if you've made a reservation with a credit card, after all if you don't show for any reason, they will certainly charge you for the night. I was really amazed that these jerks would carry out this kind of policy on an ongoing basis. I hope others refuse to patronize them and if you do stay, CHECK IN EARLY.";1;0;0;0;Y;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw

Personally I love newer looking and moder hotels and the Whitehall is not that at all. But the location is awesome. It is right by mag mile, the Hancock, the water tower and walking distance from many more Chicago landmarks. The staff is very nice and welcoming. There is no ice machine. You have to call the front desk and they will bring you ice. It was convenient that there were 2 restaurants connected to the hotel. One elevator broke for awhile and I had to wait awhile to go back up to my room. Overall I would stay here again because of the price and location.";3;0;0;0;Y;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

The staff was pleasant and efficient and the rooms were well appointed and clean.The best parts of the hotel are the lounge, which is nicely rehabbed and very charming, the beds (super comfy) and the bathrooms which have been most recently renovated. We had breakfast in the adjacent restaurant the next morning and found good service and fresh food cooked well.I give the Whitehall 4 stars primarily because of the VALUE of the place. We paid $99 on a Groupon promotion and that INCLUDED valet parking and continental breakfast. What a deal!

When I checked in the staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms hadn't been cleaned in I don't know how long, I had to walk around in shoes because the carpet was wet everywhere and I was afraid to let anything touch me directly. The room was hot and stuffy and the air conditioner didn't do much. I even had to put towels down on the bed because the sheets were disgusting. However, I was charged not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times for parking. I had to call three different times to get these charges taken off. And the last time I talked to a manager she acted as if she was doing me a favor by not charging me for parking, even though I didn't park there!At first I overlooked the charges because the staff that checked me in was super nice. However, the General Manager was very rude and unprofessional. They had charged me so many times I was even charged overdraft fees on my debit card and when I asked for him to reimburse me he said he would transfer me to the Accounting Department and then proceeded to hang up. When I called back he said he was the Accounting Department and said that he wouldn't talk to me. I asked if he could transfer me to someone who would try to help me but he refused. I paid almost $200 for this room, minus all the extra charges, but I still cannot believe how terrible I was treated. Very unprofessional and rude. After having to stay in my dump of a room and to be treated like I was the one causing all the problems was just astonishing to me. As a General Manager I feel as if you should handle problems instead of handing me off to front desk staff. He spoke to me very condescending voice and instead of trying to help me he did everything he could to not speak to me (even hanging up).

This hotel does not assist in booking a room. I called several times, including leaving phone messages (for Chantel) and not ONCE did the hotel return calls. You'd think they would want to return calls to make sure you get a room? I had to call an additional service, the Starline Booking number to make reservations and the only reason I did that was because of going there for a wedding party staying there. If the entire wedding party hadn't been staying at this hotel, I would not have bothered due to the many phone calls and frustrating experience in even trying to book a room! The reservation hotline is also not much help because they seem to know nothing about the hotel, area of town, or features.*Plain Jane, bare minimal decoration rooms. For a hotel that charges $349 a night - $349 a night on up! They sure do have some basic, ugly rooms. Everything is very plain, the room wasn't even stocked with toilet paper or kleenex - we had to go ask for some, the rooms are brown carpet, brown headboard, white towels, white bedding. Plain and ugly.*Doorman/ bell hops - they were friendly and nice but paid no attention to taking care of luggage! Luggage cases were dragged out of taxi with very little care and dragged across the sidewalks and into the hotel - scraping up the luggage until I noticed! Our luggage had wheels on them - they were dragging the suitcases down sidewalk and through lobby without using the wheel side - thank you for scraping and damaging my new luggage.If I could give this hotel 0 stars, I would, but unfortunately you can't click 0. The customer service at this hotel is terrible - they all seem in a fog or haze, running through the motions of their job without paying attention to the care of the customer nor customer's things - and they don't even fully perform their job. For a hotel that is so expensive, I guess they assume people will stay there based on their location - but their service is horrible and not worth the trip.

The moment I saw the river i fell in love with Chicago :) The Tremont, it was mediocre. We got a good deal on the price, so we can't complain. Which may be why our king size bed was out-dated, not the luxury pillow top style. And no screens on the windows, which you had to open. But like I said, it's not to complain. Just simply my opinion, so you are informed, in the event these features mentioned are your deal breakers! The week we were there, was mid 60's, beautiful. The lobby very cozy and nice but.....HOT, wow. The front desk gal, not so friendly or enthusiastic but gets the job done and answers your questions accurately. One elevator, slow and old, sometime we jumped in the service elevator haha. TV not too many channels, ESPN2 didn't have sound, not a big deal for me the boyfriend begs to differ. House cleaning did an excellent job everyday, much appreciated, always nice to come back to a clean and straightened room after a long day. The air conditioning didn't work and the only option was to open unscreened windows. Why? you ask......it's that time of year and they switched over to the heating system. This was the only downer, everything else we could roll with. With that being said.....if the price is right we would stay their again. It's in a excellent location.

My friend and I left to have a few drinks only then could I bring myself to say we should stay there. $55 was reasonable which left me a few hundred more to spend out for the night.  When I came in a 3:30 AM I decided to take a look at the other floors and the roof. It was worth the experience the views are amazing and if you are a fan of history this place has it. In 1936 Serial Killer Robert Nixon killed one of his victims on the fifth floor of this hotel. The over night clerk says he isn't sure which room it happened in but room 515 is creepy. Since I know the murder took place on the fifth floor that could be the spot. I did drop my toothbrush on the floor so it was lost forever and yes it smells and yes the walls are cracked and crumbling but to be in the heart of the city for that cheap of a price was well worth it. We were on 16th floor and the other people there were Belgians who stay there every year when they come to town.

We looked for a hotel that would allow us to be close to the things we wanted to enjoy and The Sutton Place Hotel had the right location. (Be sure to check for specials and consider the different types of rooms. The prices vary widely.) Our first impression as we checked in was that the lobby was dark and the staff was unfriendly. Once we got to the room, things were much better. (The elevator was one of the fastest I have ever ridden.) The Deluxe King Room was spacious and had a nice view of Rush St. The bathroom was huge for a hotel. The tub was big enough for two! The room included a nice sound system with a CD player and a few CDs. Unfortunately the CDs had seen better days and there was a lot of skipping. The location of this hotel is great if you want to experience Rush St. with a minimum of travel. We went to dinner at Gibsons, had drinks at Dublin's Pub, and listened to jazz at The Back Room without walking more than a half block. Many drinks later we retired for the evening. A soak in the tub was a perfect way to wind down. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. The A/C was very quiet, but effective at keeping the room cool. In the morning we went to The Original Pancake House which is right across the street. The apple pancake was delicious! Once again, the location of this hotel was our primary reason for choosing it. As we checked out after a wonderful stay, we were surprised by the steep cost of valet parking. I thought that $40/day for a guest of the hotel was a little steep. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep Sutton Place in mind for our next trip to Rush St.";4;4;2;0;N;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
4/17/2011;EnUvlaimkOw0y8szNeaC3Q;y3IH1jtMxGkSvZYnCnh5Yg;"Overall, nice room but with some quirks. I checked in to this hotel for a 8 night stay. When I got to the front desk, they didn't have my reservation. Great. Luckily, I had my Expedia confirmation page and everything was squared away. My room was on the 6th floor and had a view of nothing great, just the nearby neighborhood of condos and Rush St. below. The room was pretty spacious. It had a decent size closet, king size bed, desk, dresser with TV on top, mini bar, and a lounge chair with an ottoman. Closet had an extra pillow, lots of hangers, and laundry bags. The bathroom was very nice. It had 1 sink, a toilet (yes, obvious), a shower, and a separate bath tub. They had a lot of towels in there and also a terry cloth robe for use. There was also shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, and 2 different bars of soap (one was aloe and the other was oatmeal I think). The maid was always good about replenishing the supply of bath goodies everyday. I liked that. They also had a hair drier for guest use. Wi-fi is not free and there is a daily rate. However, you can get free internet just by signing up as a member of the Sutton Hotel hotels. Signing up to be a member is free and you can do this on their website. When I was setting up my laptop, I called down to the front desk and told them I had a membership and they gave me the code for the Wi-fi. Pretty simple. Maid service was great here. They always did my room in a timely manner, did the bed, put fresh towels, and refilled on the bath goodies. Fantastic! So with the above, I would have given this place 4 stars but not everything was that great. I had a huge issue with the bedding. The bedding consisted of 4 huge pillows (awesome), a mattress cover, and a thin comforter. Where were the rest of the sheets? During my stay, Chicago was in the 40's to the 50's at night, and I had a hard time sleeping because I was freezing my ass off. I had to get up and turn the heat up to 77 just to get comfortable enough to sleep. Another issue was the Wi-fi. It was very weak. I couldn't even load two pages simultaneously. Annoying. The shower in the bathroom was also an issue in that it leaked water. I'm not even sure from where it leaked, however the first time I used it and I got out, there was water that ran all over the floor and then on to the carpet at the bathroom doorway. From the stain on the carpet outside the bathroom door, I could see that I wasn't the first guest that had this issue. I used the shower only once because of this and just stuck to baths (which isn't bad) the rest of my stay. Location was pretty good. It was in between 2 Red line stations so it was easy to get on the L and go around the city. It's also fairly close to the John Hancock Observatory and the shops on Michigan Ave. Overall, it was a good value when booking through Expedia in advance. Can't say I would stay here again though.";3;4;1;0;N;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

The staff here are tremendously friendly and really go out of their way to accommodate you. The first night I went on a frantic search looking for the ice machine which I'm used to be in a private room in the corner but after a walk up and down the hall, I finally called the front desk inquiring where such a thing was. Apparently, they really value their quiet here at Sutton Place and room service brings up anything you need at any hour. That a little odd to me but I did notice there was a lack of drunken loud parties, walls thumping and loud music in general which was a plus. The room was comfortable, spacious, had a great view and it was easy to sleep like a baby here. The king size bed was like that of fairy tales and the goose down pillows literally cradled my head.

Also, the last day of my stay, the wireless was ""unavailable"" and there was no one onsite who knew what to do to fix it. The # of channels available on the cable TV selection was pretty lame. And like others said, the sheets kept coming off the bed, which was pretty annoying. The good points about this hotel is that the staff (aside from the whole internet debacle) was very accomodating and friendly and it was quiet (although the fact that I was on the 21st floor may have had something to do with the lack of street noise). It wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are much better places in Chicago to stay for the same price. Oh well, now I know...";3;1;0;0;N;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

The worst part was, even though I paid their ridiculously high rate for two rooms we could not get into our rooms until 3 hours after check-in! A huge pain when traveling with a group of women who want to get dressed for a night out.

So take this review with discretion, as I had no bias of price. Overall I found this hotel to be more than sufficient for my needs during my stay in Chicago. It was a short walk from the rail from O'Hare, it was an extra short walk to the office building I needed, and also a lot of food options in the area. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting crazy in Chitown and was here only for a few days for work. The breakfast bar was adequate, the bed was fairly comfortable, and just in general my room was clean and had everything I needed. The decor tried to be a bit more modern and perhaps more ""boutique-ish"" instead of your run of the mill La Quinta. The staff seemed nice enough and willing to help, so I would definitely recommend this hotel!

I really liked the room and the conveniences that if offered. Nice location, as it's right downtown, but one minor drawback is that a lot of the restaurants and stores nearby close early because it's located in a predominately commercial area. That said, you really don't have to go far to find places that are open later, so it was a minor inconvenience. One negative (and I should have taken a picture) was the ""view"" from the window. I'm sure some of the rooms have great views, but ours was of the wall on the opposite side of the courtyard where you bring in your car when you arrive. Not a major problem, but given its location, La Quinta could have laid out more of the rooms to offer better views.

I have never stayed at La Quinta property, but somehow made the assumptions that all La Quinta's are ""crappy"". I'm happy to say, I was proven wrong! My husband and I had truly enjoyed our stay. We stayed 4 nights during October 2011. *King Bed Suite: The rooms are clean, spacious and modern. I think this property may have had an update because the paint, furniture and décor were in great condition. Our had room many electrical outlets, sofa, flat screen, microwave and mini refrigerator. Average size bathrooms with shower and tub. *Service/Hotel Amenities: The staff was friendly and helpful. No bellhop. Free wifi and breakfast daily. Parking available, but it's $36 a night :/ There is Cupcake shop and Argo Tea Shop in the lobby. *Location: Great location. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown, so there's pros and cons to its location. (The cons were very minimal) -Pros: Walking distance to El train, shops, drug stores and restaurants. 2 blocks away from Sears Tower! -Cons: Business close early. The scene is ""dead"" during evenings and weekends. Not many bars in the area. *Random Tips: -Giordanos' Pizza: 4 blocks away from the hotel. The lobby has Giordano's coupons. -Car Rental: isn't needed to explore Chicago, but if you do rent, there's an Enterprise located in the hotel parking structure. If you do a day rental, you can avoid the daily parking fee, by returning to car to Enterprise, since they are located in the same structure. -Take a Drive to Wisconsin: As a huge cheese lover, I was over the top giddy when I found out Wisconsin was only an hour away. We rented a car for a day and drove to explore Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The highway from Chicago to Milwaukee has many cheese themed shops and a shopping outlet with 5% sales tax! -Pet Friendly: Throughout my stay I saw a few people checking in with their pets.";4;2;0;0;N;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA

Very pet friendly! No restrictions on the weight or breed (which is awesome because I have a pitbull, which can sometimes be an issue). There's a pet station outside equipped with bags to pick up messes.  I'm staying Sunday - Tuesday: using a AAA discount, Sunday night was $152 & Monday was $215. If you have AAA discount, use it - I saved like $40 & who isn't a fan of saving money? Oh, and I booked the hotel about 10 hours before we arrived. Free Internet?! WHOO HOO! Maybe I'm just cheap so I never get to experience this, but that is oh-so-awesome in my world. Hence...sitting in the hotel room after an 18 hour car ride...and I decided I was happy enough to write a review instead of sleep. I can smoke in the room. No worries, they have non-smoking rooms as well, but I am such a fan of smoking in my hotel rooms so I am LOVING it here :) Bonus: Air conditioning was all ready on & it's simple to control to make it cooler. BOOYAH! The TV is nice - fridge, microwave, coffee pot & work station in the room. The bed seems comfy enough. While Philippe's review made me roll with laughter, his comment is legit. The shower is a little awkward! Though it may be entertaining for some situations ;) The room is clean. The staff is friendly. While breakfast sounds delicious, I can't imagine I'll ever be up early enough for it. Check-in isn't until 3PM, but they do try to honor early check-ins. Check-out is at noon.   Parking - there is a garage behind the hotel. Make sure you get a ticket & you get it validated by the hotel. By doing this, you may come & go as you please & it'll be free. Without the validation, you will have to pay. It's located on Madison so you actually need to drive past the hotel, take a right on Washington, a right on Wells and then a right on Madison. It's right behind the hotel, but there is an unloading zone in-between the garage & the hotel if you need/want it. The low down on the vending machines: First floor has snacks, ice cream & soda. Second floor has soda & snacks. All other floors have soda machines. All the soda vending machines are Coke, but there is one PEPSI machine on the 6th floor. It's not located where the other machines are on different floors - the Pepsi machine is tucked away where the ice machine would be on the 6th floor (if they had an ice machine). The ice machines are on various floors - it is listed in that space what floors have ice. There is also a recycling station located by the ice machines. YaY recycling! I think all the room service is out-sourced. The pizza, for example, is from a chain restaurant (that I don't support), but you shouldn't be coming to Chicago to eat chain pizza anyways! Do yourself a favor & hit one of the places recommended on Yelp :) It's nice & dark in the room so it's going to be easy taking a nap at 5PM...also a plus for me cause I love napping!

It's located in the 'west loop,' just a few blocks from the Sears/Willis tower. And there are a couple 'L' stops located close by which makes transportation easy. The river and both major parks are within walking distance also. As for the hotel itself, it's very nice and clean. The room is big enough for 4 people. The bathroom is pretty big as well and our room even had a partial view of Willis Tower. Nice. The best part is the complementary breakfast. It's quite a spread. They have make-your-own waffle stations, hot foods like eggs and sausage and bacon as well as pastries, cereal, and fruit. They also claimed to have free wifi but it never really worked for us in our room. I did bring my laptop so I was able to connect directly and it worked great.

My boyfriend worked across the street in a high rise as security and he suggested I stay here, so I did. I paid $159 after using my ATT corporate code which saved me about $30 a night. The stay was great. They don't just let anyone roll up in here and go to your room. They have to check with the front desk which will call your room and ask if it's okay for whoever it is to come up. They offer free breakfast from 6am-9am on the weekdays and 7-9 or 10 on the weekends. They serve juice, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, sausage, bacon, muffins, and eggs (just and FYI - On the weekends they don't have bacon or eggs). The front desk let me pay for my stay in cash. They also offer conference rooms, vending machines, a swimming pool, internet access with a printer, and an exercise room. I stayed an additional two times after the first visit and my ATT code always worked. The staff was always friendly and they always accomodated me in any way they could or I needed. I would suggest this place to anyone. A great location for the price. **EDIT** There is also a mini fridge, a flat screen tv in the room with cable channels, and a microwave.

Unlike the roadside properties of this chain, this La Quinta is in the western edge of the Loop (Franklin + Madison) so it is convenient for business folk and for leisure travelers visiting the nearby Sears/Willis Tower. My room was pleasant enough, with carpeting in one half of the room and wood flooring in the other. There was a microwave, empty mini-fridge, and coffeemaker. My view overlooked Madison, and it was fun to watch the workers in the building across the street and those rushing to the nearby CTA and Metra stations. True, the closet is a bit small and the toiletries are limited, but they have very nice rates for a downtown property. The breakfast buffet is included, and I made my own waffle to go along with my filling meal (sausage, bacon, muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice etc.). The staff seemed busy, but most of the time they did take an extra second to greet me like a real guest.

We were immediately greeted at the front curb and again inside the lobby by friendly attendants who told us exactly what to do and where to go.   The king room we were in was a little on the small side, however they really made the most of the space and the room was decorated with a neat combination of paintings and drawings and pictures. Our room looked out onto the street, which was fine with us.  And since the weather was nice we were actually able to open the window, only a few inches though, and let in fresh air and hear the city. The bed was very comfy and we got a great night sleep.  All the linens were clean and pressed.   The room has all the modern touches you would expect, flat screen television and even an Ipod dock/radio on the nightstand.  Free Wifi and a safe. Within walking distance of lots of great places to eat, or the lake or the zoo.

There are a few areas in the renovations that I noticed that could have been done a little better, but overall, it's a nice place to stay. The decor is very 50's style/kitschy, but I loved it. We got a suite, which was a nice size. The bathroom area is a little small. You have a separate sink/vanity area from the room with the toilet/shower which is small. They probably could have installed the bathroom door differently, as it's a bit awkward using the toilet. Decent sized closet but the best part was that you had drawers hidden under the bed to stow your non-hanging clothes, etc. I wish EVERY hotel did this! My only gripe with the room is that the safe didn't work. The location is a nice one, right in Lincoln Park. I'm not positive I'd stay in the Lincoln Park area on my next visit, but if we do, I'm sure we will be staying at this hotel. We JUST missed the grand opening of their rooftop bar.

Recently renovated, the decor is charming. Walking in to the spacious and attractive lobby, greeted by smiling and helpful staff, you know you are in for a treat. Its location is simply unbeatable--right across the street from Lincoln Park, a couple of blocks from the North Ave. Beach, a stone's throw from major bus lines (the 22, the 151) that will get you anywhere around Chicago you care to go. Our particular room was small but affordable, well-kept and attractively decorated in sort of a ""Mad Men"" '60's style (to borrow a description from other reviewers).  Larger rooms are available, but as we spent all of our time out exploring Chicago, the size of the room was not a problem for us. Oh, and do ask for a lake view room--so worth it! The hotel also has a wonderful little breakfast cafe with delicious cherry scones and raspberry muffins made fresh daily, and a great restaurant for dinner. The rooftop bar is now open and holy moly what a view! The bar is a real party scene on the weekends, but go up during the week when it's a bit quieter and enjoy a drink while watching the sunset--it is heavenly! The staff is excellent--friendly, professional, knowledgeable and just plain fun! Although there is no concierge as such, everyone behind the lobby counter was able to answer our touristy questions (where is the nearest ATM, which bus will get us to xyz, where is the best local place to get an Italian meat sandwich...).

They overbooked the hotel and kept trying to turn our guests away - despite having had reservations for months! And they didn't seem able to cope with guests inquiries and issues because they seemed overwhelmed. If I did it again I would still book rooms there simply because the location was so convenient for our events, but I do hope the hotel improves its operations as things settle in.

The first thing I noticed upon entry was the smell of the place.  I think they use Drakkar or some other mens' cologne for their mop water or just have guys walking around spritzing it into the air.  I guess there are worse smells in the world.  I just don't like the cheese ball smell of cologne.  The free smells at Jimmy Johns are better. There is a very large and open lobby area with a bar, tables and couches.  This was my destination.  Victoria on tap?  Yes, please.  Thanks, cuz.   As for the lobby loo, it's only alright.  I've seen some seriously fancy hotel loos (hello, Nomi and that palace in Cancun), but this one doesn't quite measure up.  It's better than a Burger King bathroom though.   As for the rooms, they're nice.  I could camp out for a few days in one. After a tour of a few River North joints, my cousin and I came back to the lobby bar and ordered a bacon and chorizo flat bread.  Seriously, how can anyone resist ordering something containing these two ingredients.  Delicious and recommended.   It's not a bad place to hang out for a few quiet drinks or even stay a night or two.

I was there for a conference, and the conference facilities on the lower levels were rather nice.  They provided tables to sit at instead of just chairs, which I love since I tend to take a lot of notes on a laptop or, in this case, my new iPad.   I ordered room service for two meals, one lunch & one dinner, and I felt like the food was good, but it was priced a couple dollars too high in my personal opinion.  I haven't had the best of luck ordering anything with avocados east of Nevada and getting good ripe ones, but the ones on my sandwich were perfect here, so kudos for that. I did have occasion to sit in the hotel bar awhile, which I felt, like most hotel bars, was overpriced a few bucks at least.  I was also disappointed my last night there, while killing an hour before leaving for the airport, that my cheese platter took almost 30 mins to be brought to me... I know it doesn't take that long to cut cheese, half an apple, and put the apricot chutney in the little bowl!   Overall I'd stay here again without hesitation.  I know the snack tricks now (get them at the gift shop & just ignore the mini bar) and the room was very comfy & relaxing during my conference down time.";4;2;0;0;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q
10/10/2009;N7BlH7aM9TXjHD404nKioQ;XSLzmNxObUzuaIKxjBJ18Q;"Took a quick trip to Chicago and decided to stay at an old favorite the Westin Chicago River North. I'm Platinum Elite, in the Starwood Preferred Guest, frequent guest program and based on my past stays, this property is very consistent in it's treatment of guests, especially Elite members. Location has good access to the loop, just a ten to 15 minute walk to Macy's on State Street or Michigan Avenue shopping. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation. You can use either of the L Stations on Lake or the Grand Street station on the Red line. Each of these three station are 5 to 10 minute walk (based on if you have luggage and weather) from the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I was the only person checking in. There is a separate Gold/Platinum check-in Line, since I was the only person, there was no need to use it. Check-in was pleasant, I was recognized as a Platinum member and returning guest. If you are the type of person who loses hotel folios or needs to submit one with an expense report be sure to ask that a folio be emailed to you at check-out. Assigned a suite on the 20th floor just down the hall from Executive Club.  The room faces the marina towers.  The room is maintained but the entry way has a slightly ""dated"" feeling.  There is a wet-bar to the left of the entry, once you enter the a parlor room. The granite makes it feel heavy and dark, which is why I think it's dated. There is a closet of the entry for added storage. The parlor portion of the room has the previously used Westin decor scheme, but again, everything is well maintained, rooms are spotless. I got a tip that they will be refreshing rooms, which will be welcomed. There is a flat panel with HD channels and each room comes with complementary access to a mac computer. The room is well lit considering it's location and there is ample lighting. The desk is located by the window and has plenty of work space and sockets for phones, cameras, PDAs, etc.  In my honest opinion, the only negative is there is no bathroom in the parlor. At the far end of the parlor, is the entry to the bedroom. These are some of the largest hotel bedrooms I've ever stayed in, it's very spacious. The room consist of a large closet, heavenly bed, plasma TV, ipod docking station and river view seating. Opposite the entry is the bathroom.  Consistent with the room size, the bathroom is huge. HUGE!  Three 3 people could easily use this bathroom at once. Single sink with good counter space, large soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of towels. The marble does date the room and because it's dark makes the bathroom feel dark as well.  The negative, there is only one since and the there was not a full compliment of Westin brand toiletries in the room. There was bar soap, condition and shampoo. No lotion, shower gel or mouthwash. I carry my own, but it's food for thought. This property has a Westin Executive Club.  It's a nice lounge with good views of the Loop and Near Westside. The morning of my stay, there was a Continental spread and the evening presentation consisted of two hot foods (dumplings and something else) and various fruits and cheeses. Not the best, but not bad. In my stays, I don't ever recall the lounge being crowded or busy. The Fitness Center [AKA Westin Workout] is located on the lower levels of the hotel tower.  It's one of the few Gyms with an attendant who verifies your room and status. For a large urban hotel, the space is small but adequate.  The hotel does not have a pool. There is a business Center on the first level, just before the elevators.  Note, there is a sign that indicates you can print a boarding pass, however, the PC's are not programmed for carriers which have a second screen to print a pass.   If you encounter a problem, ask the concierge for assistance. The hotel is wired for with High Speed Wired & Wireless Internet Access.  As with most Starwood branded properties, wifi is free in the lobby.  If your assigned a room on the Executive Club Level, you're provided with a mac in your room. The hotels lobby is Wide open lobby.  In the many stays I've had at this property, I've met friends in the lobby and I don't ever recall there being more than 5 people there. It's a nice space with good light and access to the river. Embers restaurant is just off the lobby. FINAL IMPRESSION The staff is professional, courteous and very helpful. Everyone I encountered was pleasant from the door man to the lounge attendant.  The hotel is clean and well maintained. The location is great so no car is needed. I would return and recommend this hotel for business and leisure travelers.  Leisure travelers and those traveling with children need to remember there is no pool. The staff, platinum recognition and lounge, give it an edge on other properties. In winter I like being on Michigan avenue, but all the shoppers can be stressful so the WRN is a good place to set up base. Solid property and I recommend.";5;11;0;0;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

A decent sushi bar when you don't want to head out into the cold Chicago winterness.   The rooms are nice, I would definitely ask to be on the river side for a nice view.  I love when it snows and to watch it cover the city in a soft white blanket from your cozy hotel room...that is the best! This hotel is within walking distance of several fine restaurants, shopping, and the theatre district.  Great location, since its not on Michigan Avenue, it doesn't have the crowds making noise outside your windows.  Harry Caray's right across the street, House of Blues and a decent Thai place on Clark.";4;4;3;0;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q
4/25/2011;edaV63FNA;WfUf93jxxOGlniQSt-qciQ;"Stayed here during a conference that was held in the downstairs area and everything was really spot on and luxurious feeling. First, my room: very nice. I was on the 10th floor with a view of the crazy round beehive buildings that are just across the street (and a slice of the river if you wanted to crane your neck.) The room contained a lovely chaise lounge by the window, an extremely comfortable king bed, a fluffy robe, a delightful high-pressure shower head, etc. Overall my only complaint would be that the in-room internet is on the slow side. Next, the food, while tending towards the heavy, meat-laden side (not that meat-laden is a bad thing) is delicious. Meals served during the event, a meal I ate in the bar and in-room dining were all super. The sushi bar in the lobby is a nice touch and the burger I got delivered to my room was huge and amazing. Room service took about 45 minutes to arrive, so that is on the longer side, but it was worth it. The conference facilities downstairs were classy. Good lighting and a high level of service from the staff at all times. But one thing: not enough plugs! Location is central and close to local attractions, restaurants, the river walk, etc. No complaints there. Overall, an excellent place to be if you have to be in Chicago for a couple days.";5;2;1;1;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q
1/2/2009;nQ4pL5cxtjeFdXLXY9jb0g;jldgW9Ge1jZ2Iae6TPv5Dw;"I go to Chicago a fair amount on business and have stayed at the Westin several times. Its a comfortable place and a convenient location (House of Blues is right next door), but there are some annoyances. I actually booked my next stay at a different hotel. I'd certainly stay at the Westin again but at the moment it's not my first choice. First, some good stuff. The staff is great -- very friendly and professional. If you need a cab, the doorman is good and aggressive at getting you set up. The lobby and room decor are great, the bed very comfortable, the rooms spacious, and the shower double-headed. So far so good. The problems start with the TV. I fired my TV at home years ago, so this a TV on the road is quite a novelty, so I'd like it to work and have some channels. Despite it being a nice big LCD, they apparently don't have much in the way of cable. Yes HBO, but no Comedy Central, and some stations don't have sound. Kinda defeats the purpose. I have to have Internet access too. No wireless in the rooms, but that's would be passable except that the past two times I went, the Ethernet cord had a broken tip & kept slipping out. To their credit they fixed it when I pointed it out, but housekeeping should be trained to check these things and proactively make sure it's OK. Oh, and here's a tip, Westin: snagless Cat 5 cable has been around forever. Give it a try. Room service is good if you get the right thing -- they have a baked red fish that's excellent. But the cheeseburger is truly awful. You can get sushi delivered -- very cool -- but the one time I ate downstairs at the sushi bar, it was questionable (I did a separate review on that). The breakfast buffet has some tasty items but is far too small, and there's a disappointing lack of fresh waffles or omelettes. The workout room is a bit small but not bad unless there's a crowd, but there's no pool or hot tub, which I'd love. There have been some other little annoyances, like a drippy faucet, and the fact that road noise leaks through the window enough to bug me. Overall, it's not a bad place to stay on business, but I'm hoping to find better.";3;6;1;0;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

The interior is, in a word, classy.  I've heard that the hotel was an Asian themed hotel in a prior life, and you can definitely see it in the decor.  The house restaurant has sushi available for room service, haven't tried it but I've heard it's pretty tasty.  I did look at the prices and it didn't look any more expensive than a regular sushi place. The rooms are great.  Bathrooms are huge and sleek, dual-shower heads and big towels. The beds are...well Westin Heavenly Beds.  Super comfortable and takes about 10 seconds to fall asleep. Good views of the river and right across from House of Blues doesn't hurt either.  Location isn't bad, close enough to walk to places like Rockit and there's a 7-11 close by for snacking needs.";4;1;1;1;N;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

And the power outlet or two that didn't work. And the spotty wifi in the room (that still cost $10). So why even 3 stars? Because the rooms are otherwise good and spacious (nice TV, nice showers too), the location is great, the staff was quite friendly and helpful and the downstairs restaurant exceedingly friendly to small-ish kids.  And the room rate was fine.

But you do get a wonderfully appointed room with a large bathroom. The furniture is new and above all comfortable. Flatscreen televisions might not be the norm at all hotels but they are at The Talbott and they are HD. But I think it's the little things that really make the Talbott special. Their bath towels are huge and soft. They have complimentary Aveda products in the bathrooms. There is a full sized umbrella in the closet. There is a telephone next to the toilet just in case you need to do business while you are doing business. If you stay at the Talbott expect to be warmly greeted by everyone that works there. And I'm not talking about simple hellos but ""How are you today?"" and ""Where are you travelling from?"" types of questions. Every employee at the Talbott made me feel welcome which you don't always get at bigger hotels. I am already looking forward to my return trip in 2011.";5;1;1;1;N;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w

Blows away the Drake which was the last Chicago hotel I visited.  Largest basic king rooms in the city.  Modern, upscale feel, yet also warm and inviting. Hotel staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  They all truly cared about the business and their guests. The location is also amazing. It's right in the heart of the city - shopping, Oak Street beach, restaurants, bars, spas...but just off the Michigan Ave so you have some peace and quiet for relaxation.  A must try if you're looking for an escape to the city or are visiting from out of town. You won't be disappointed!";5;0;0;0;N;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w
8/30/2010;WbcqR81uxUcGwdPdXT6mPw;vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw;"I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it.  Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least.   But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel.  First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention).   I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork.  The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains.   I definitely love the room.  While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task.  So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in.  My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof.  I mean, seriously.  They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason.  I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel.   First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation.  The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent.  First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either.  Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there.   But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM.  As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account.  Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite.  So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes.  Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor).  The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold.  It was pathetic room service at its finest.   We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant.  The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately.";1;6;1;0;N;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w

Other hotels around it were all glitzy and overpriced but this place was just what we wanted: small, clean, luxurious, quiet and comfortable. We got a standard room and it was lovely and rather spacious for a big city hotel. The location is great and I found the staff to be super friendly and helpful. The concierge made spot-on suggestions for all our requests, from cheap(est) places to buy wine, great restaurants and even help us find some cool independent book stores. Every time we left, the doorman asked if we needed a cab or directions. When we called down to the front desk to ask for a mini fridge for leftovers (and to chill our wine, of course),  they sent one up within 10 minutes. It's true, the elevator is on the slow side but not a big deal.  We also didn't try the room service but that stuff is never good anywhere and you don't need it since you're in a major metropolitan area where restaurants will deliver right to you at all hours if you don't feel like hitting the town.";5;3;3;1;N;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w

I did not experience the bar or the restaurant so no comment.   There is a nice carryout place across the street on the corner.  Having otherwise stayed at The James (way overrated) in Chicago I would choose the Talbott for any family in town, sensible couple or business person.  There seems to be plenty of cool exciting places to see and be scene in Chicago and if your room does not need to be one of them stay here.  The Talbott is a welcoming comfortable place to stay.";4;1;1;0;N;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w

Valet'd the car, checked in, room was small but nice. Here's where the problems begin... The room was hot, 79 degrees. No worries, we were going to hit the town anyways. So we cranked it down to the minimum temperature allowed, 65, and went out. Returned several hours later, still hot. Maybe it didn't click on? Tried to re-set it but we ultimately ended up suffering through a sticky, sweaty night. This is when we noticed the unbelievably shitty quality of the bedding. Stiff, sandpaper-y, cheap. First thing in the morning, I notified the front desk that our AC might be broken. We went out and came back maybe 4-6 hours later to find that nothing had been done. When the maintenance guy finally came, he confirmed that it was broken and he called downstairs to get our room changed. Waited at least a 1/2 hour for a bellhop to come move our bags, never did. Called again and asked, still waiting...finally went down to the lobby and started to pitch a fit. Bellhop never came, so my boyfriend and the maintenance man dragged all of our bags down 2 floors. Room #2 smelled god awful as soon as we walked in. Some kind of chemical or moth ball smell. Had to argue with the hotel staff for a good 15 minutes about the smell before I finally went ballistic down in the lobby. NOW a manager intervenes... We got upgraded to a much bigger, nicer room on another floor. They also comp'd our valet parking, breakfast, and gave us a complimentary one night stay for a location closer to home on the East coast. Another manager saw us the next day and personally apologized, he did seem truly embarrassed.

I told the concierge that we were in town for our anniversary so they made sure that we had a great room overlooking the river and straight ahead was the Trump Hotel. The location is seriously unreal for the price. The neighborhood hotels are The Hardrock, Trump Towers, etc (all high end hotels). Restaurants and entertainment is all walking distance.

Yes, the rooms are small, but they are efficient. I have stayed in much smaller rooms. The room didn't feel cramped at all. We booked a room in the River Hotel(floors 3-10) but we got a room in the Club Quarters(11 and up). Since it was as described, I imagine it was the same accommodations I could expect from the River Hotel, just with a better view. Everyone we spoke to was very nice, and accommodating. There is no Iron in the room, but there is one available on one of the other floors. There are water bottles available that you can fill up, which was fantastic. We ended up getting them for my parents too, because water at their hotel was $8. We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but it looked very nice, and is highly rated. The outdoor tables are super cute. I think the best thing about this hotel though is the location. It's right on the Chicago River near Michigan Avenue. There is so much that is within walking distance. It is also super close to L stops. The closest one is State/Lake, which has the Red line, and a couple others. A block up at Clark/Lake is the Blue Line that will take you to/from O'Hare. It's easy walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, State St, the Art Institute. There are also easy buses to Lincoln Park Zoo and Navy Pier. There is a Corner Bakery Cafe located right next door too for a cheap, good breakfast, or a lite snack. I also felt very safe at this hotel, after midnight you have to be buzzed in, you also have to use your key to access the Elevator. Apparently this is a Historic Building also. At one time, briefly, it was the tallest Building in Chicago, it is also considering the skinniest Sky Scraper in Chicago. It's a beautiful building! If you are someone who is looking for a small, nice, efficient room close to everything, this place is perfect for you. If you are looking for a big, luxurious room with all sorts of amenities, this place probably isn't for you. Considering its about $75 less a night than most of the surrounding hotels though, it's a fantastic deal! I would definitely stay here again.";5;2;2;2;N;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

Cons: -the floor I was on (11th) smelled like smoke. -bed was cheap. -sheets and bedspread were dollar store quality.

It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer. You shouldn't come here either.";1;1;1;1;N;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

This hotel is located in what i think is a perfect place, right in front of the river, walking distance to lots of places (restaurants, bars, magnificent mile, millennium park).  It is pretty nice, clean, great service.  It has a 24hr lobby service.   Their restaurant is pretty good/not bad.  They have a really good pannini for lunch (brie, with cranberry mayo, smoked turkey and green apple).  Their breakfasts, however, were just okay.  I recommend going to the Coner Bakery just a couple of yards away for breakfast. I really like the fact that they have, on every floor, a filtered water dispenser with empty bottles.  I personally drink plenty of water and not having to buy water during my stay was a plus for me. They also have a 'computer room' with 2 (or was it 3?) pcs with access to internet and printer.  This was great to have and came in handy when i realized we had forgotten to print our boat tour confirmation and needed it that afternoon.  It's also handy if you want to check in before going to the airport.  Ah, the train station is only about 4-5 blocks away.  We actually arrived from South Bend, IN via train and were able to find the hotel fairly quickly. One con:  VERY small rooms.  Very small.  It was 3 of us in one room so it was a bit...  uncomfortable at times; but not so much, really, as we spent most of our time walking around Chicago.  But consider this if you plan to stay here. Free WIfi.  Yes, all over the property.  Huge plus too. Overall, we were all very happy staying at the River Hotel and thus, it gets 5 stars.

But it's the little things. No hair drier -- one supplied.  Room said to have a 'kitchenette' -- well one person's kitchenette is another person's fridge and microwave - no plates or utensils or.....  Bathroom supplies not replenished, but if you ask they are there.  Then the A/C broke.  Tried to explain that it wasn't the thermostat but was the compressor but we had to go through the steps of replacing the batteries in the thermostat and allowing it to fail to fix the problem.  Kind of like calling India when your computer has a failure code.  Follow the script.  But there was a new room supplied, not exactly the same but close.  And they said they would move us from one room to the other but that wasn't done but I didn't care because then I knew it was done correctly. Overall, if you can get a great price then try the place but I rate it comparable to the SpringHill Suites (River North) or the Holiday Inn (Merchandise Mart).  If you can get Residence Inn (either downtown) then I would select those.

Jennifer, my coordinator was helpful, friendly and unfortunately also a victim of this monstrosity of a business. My wedding looked a little shabby and as I marched down the aisle, I almost cried at how awful the ceremony looked. I couldn't believe that my instructions were not followed as I laid them out. That may or may not have been the fault of my mother. My wedding favors were never set out or returned to me. My guest book disappeared. My wedding coordinator came up to me (after My vows were read) and told me my cake was not there, and that I would have to sorta pantomime cutting a piece of cardboard for my photographs and guests. (amazing how no one confirmed that my cake was made maybe a day or two before). It wasn't until later I discovered what actually happened. The cake was outsourced to Bake for Me on Roosevelt. Jennifer assured me that my cake would be great. When I came in for my cake tasting, some 2 or 3 months earlier (an appointment that was made) I had to fight for the attention of person given a tasting to 3 or 4 other couples (why did I have to make an appointment?) Apparently, after I made my cake choice, My order was stuck in the back of a file, never to see the light of day. After I returned from my honeymoon, I was told I had to pursue the bakery (not the hotel who had a agreement with this bakery) for a refund. After all, all you did was make us cut a piece a cardboard and have my guests eat cake from Jewel - Osco). I was so heartbroken, All I could do is drink Tequila Sunrises at my open bar (which I was told was upgraded, but also closed 1/2 hr early).

6/28/2009;xyUY5VPh;FjmgJIvYxt5TTJSToiPn8g;"Stayed here for one night while I was in town to catch a rock show at the Empty Bottle club (maybe 3-4 miles away and Crowne Plaza is one of the closer hotels to it).  Got a good deal on the room and I've stayed at CP's in other cities when going to shows and events, so I'm kinda used to them.   The desk staff, as usual for a CP, were not great, but were decent.  The concierge and doormen were somewhat better. The bathroom seemed pretty clean and new, and the room had a balcony which was a nice touch if it didn't overlook a freeway/ parking lot/ garage.  Nope, you're not paying for ""view"" here.  The balcony is also secluded by concrete walls from adjoining balconies, which made me feel somewhat more secure than if it hadn't been. What did NOT make me feel secure was the doors that could be opened to connect my room to the adjoining room.  The door on my side did NOT lock securely - the deadbolt would only go a little way in instead of the whole way in, causing the door to be able to be opened with a good punch, kick or vibration.  Sure enough, a party of loud young guys showed up to stay in the room next door and opened the door on their side thinking probably it was a closet (same mistake I made initially).  The walls between our rooms were paper thin and I could clearly hear these bro's conversation, plus I could hear when they went out on the balcony and started yelling to their buddy down in the parking lot.  Fortunately they went out after that, and I didn't have much luggage with me, so I put my few valuables in the storage safe and went out to the show.  I thought about asking for a room change but I was on a tight schedule so I just decided to put up with it. I got home about 2:30 am and my door was still ""kinda locked"" and the next door room was quiet, so I went to sleep.  I woke up at 6:30 am to find that the door on my side of the room was open like it had been pushed or vibrated open.  The door to the next room was shut.  Nothing like my purse or money (all of which was out on the nightstand next to my bed) had been taken which made me think the door either vibrated open or the guys next door made a mistake again, realized it and then locked their door and left me alone, but it was scary, especially since some of the patrons of this hotel are kinda skeezy looking (though not all; there were some families with little kids, some budget-tourist couples and the like as well - basically a mix of what looks like budget/ family travelers and people who want a room to party all night).  I told the desk girl about the bad door lock and she seemed concerned and said she'd have someone fix it right away.   On the plus side, I had the mushroom ravioli from the restaurant for dinner.  It was reasonably tasty and came with some rolls and herbed honey butter that were REALLY tasty.  Better than what I expected from a place like this. Edited:  It's now a couple months down the road and the more I think about that situation with the door that didn't lock, the creepier I feel about what could have happened, especially given that some of the people staying at this particular hotel looked pretty dern ghetto, so in retrospect, I'm gonna knock it down a star.  I really can't recommend this place at all after an experience like that.";2;2;1;0;N;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og

Most of the rooms seemed to have nice street views - above average for a hotel. Getting there is a bit of a problem if not by car.  Local nearby bus stop is the best choice - the metro is good half mile from the hotel.  Walking from the hotel to the waterfront is a trek and is possible during the day - I wouldn't recommend at night.";4;1;1;1;N;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

Many medical professionals would have meetings, events and we would dine there. They had a nice buffet and it was nice and cozy.  It was fantastic to meet and greet after work. In later years, it became the Hyatt and it lost some of its appeal that we had come to love. Now, its the Marriott and I find myself distancing from it.  I think this hotel / restaurant does not have to be competitive because its needed in the Illinois Medical District. A few months ago, I went there with co-workers for cocktails and dinner. Well, the menu was scant and the food or should I say sandwhiches were not ""all that"".  I just am not impress and I miss the Inn at University Village.";2;1;0;1;N;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

The lady asks me how my day was. I reply well, it's been trying. I was stuck for over 4 hours in Long Beach Airport because of the wonderful Chicago weather. Being this is my first time to Chicago, not really enjoying it too much.  To top it off the organizer neglected to tell me that there were so many stops on El train from Ohare to here, so it was close to another hour of traveling. I'm tired and hungry, which causes me to start to get headache. Marriott asks for my name, so I can check in.  She then tells me...""Oh, you're not supposed to check in until tomorrow."" I'm thinking ""WTF, do you not see me here?""  Then proceeds to tell me there's no space available. She doesn't offer to help me find a new place.  Mind you this is my first time in Chicago and I have no idea where to stay. Luckily, my organizer just steps in from dinner. I tell her what's up and she's gives the front desk a piece of her mind. By chance, one of the other conference attendees also got stuck and couldn't fly in to Chicago so I was going to take her room since she wouldn't be able to check in.  Mind you my conference organizer is the one figuring this out NOT Marriott. Marriott doesn't offer to find me any alternative housing, if that room wasn't free due to circumstances, I have no idea where I would have been sleeping. BOO!!!!! I finally get to my room at 10PM, I have no energy to go exploring and I have a full on headache now but know that I have to eat or I'm going to feel like sh!t. Sadly, my only real option now is room service. (Mind you I never order room service this was my first time). Order their chicken portobello pasta but then get a call back later that they're out of portobello. *sigh* I've lost all energy to argue and just settle for plain mushroom.  Of course it's still priced a ridiculous amount of money, I should have gotten it cheaper. I don't blame the kitchen staff. He was nice man.  He throws in bottle water for free and does apologize and is sincerely sorry.  Can't blame him. I blame MARRIOTT. BTW their internet should be for free. Waaay too expensive. Should have thrown some perks in for all the crap I had to deal with.";1;2;0;0;N;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

It hadnt looked like the carpet ahd been vacuumed in months. There was a cigarette butt on the step.

THe plate that held a big cup for ice and plastic cups had cigarette burns on it also.The windows had paint chipping on them as well, with graffitti spray painted on two windows.This was the worst hotel I've ever seen.
